Deformation along the shear zones led to seismic events below the seismogenic zone of continental rifts (10\u201315\u00a0kbar and 850\u20131150\u00a0\u00b0C), similar to events observed along the East African Rift today. Processes leading to failure of the weakened rocks caused extremely high strain. We mapped pseudotachylytes along a network of millimeter to meter-scale transtensional shear zones associated with gabbronoritic dykes, and a 2\u00a0km long low-angle extensional shear zone. Deformation, initiated through priming of the rock by magmatic fluids, exploited subgrains and microfractures in olivine, with CO2-bearing fluids leading to volume expanding reactions (olivine\u00a0+\u00a0diopside\u00a0+\u00a0CO2\u00a0=\u00a0dolomite\u00a0+\u00a0enstatite), enhancing olivine fracturing. Fragmentation of the olivine grains and the addition of weaker phases facilitated strain localization and increased the strain rate by two orders of magnitude through grain size reduction (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). Sudden failure under transient brittle conditions formed pseudotachylytes. We conclude that failure along shear zones in lower crustal continental rifts is possible without remote stress events, in the presence of pre-existing textural and structural heterogeneities and events of volatile fluid infiltration.\n               ","1":"\n                  The frontal Zagros fold belt in the Fars area of Iran is generally considered to be detached on the Hormuz salt. Shortening rates and the proportion of thick-skinned deformation are debated and published balanced sections show large differences in style and amount of deformation. We believe that the main uncertainties are related to stratigraphic thickness variations, the degree of thick-skinned deformation and\/or the flexural response of the crust. We analysed the stratigraphic thickness ranges interpreted from seismic data and conclude that the interpretational uncertainties, combined with the uncalibrated interval velocities of the largely undrilled Paleozoic strata, yield a wide range of outcomes for the total Phanerozoic thickness (9.5\u201316.5\u00a0km). With an area balancing approach, we show that geological surface cross sections could be matched by various structural subsurface scenarios, including pure thin-skinned deformation with flexure and\/or thick-skinned deformation. Given the input uncertainties, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of our balanced sections and propose a geological model including a subtle control on the deformation style by the inherited pre-salt basin morphology. Given the uncertainties, we conclude that the contribution of thick-skinned deformation to the structural evolution remains indefinite and published shortening values may be much more unconstrained than typically specified.\n               ","2":"\n                  Structures in Cretaceous strata in the Devils River Uplift of west Texas include folds, thrust faults, and bedding-parallel veins indicative of contractional deformation in a thrust faulting stress regime. In this study we analyze a series of small-wavelength (meters to tens of meters) folds in roadcut exposures northwest of Del Rio, Texas. The folds have WNW-ESE dominant trends, gently plunging axes, and are gentle to tight with upright to inclined axial surfaces of variable vergence. These structures are interpreted as detachment folds, with detachments within volcanic ash or mudrock beds. Observed thickening in anticline cores was by ductile flow of volcanic ash or mudrock, small-scale folding, and thrust or reverse faulting. Bed-perpendicular calcite veins are common and in some cases are offset by flexural slip on fold limbs, indicating that folding occurred after brittle failure and extension vein formation in lithified rock. Although rare, bed-parallel calcite veins are also present in the exposure and indicative of a thrust faulting stress regime. Occasional normal and reverse or thrust faults are also present in the exposures. Fluid inclusion analysis of vein cements from extension fractures and faults yielded homogenization temperatures of 71\u2013101\u00a0\u00b0C, and estimated trapping depths of 2.2\u20133.5\u00a0km prior to and coeval with folding. We interpret these folds as having formed during NNE-SSW directed Laramide shortening (\u223c80\u201340\u00a0Ma) in a thrust-faulting stress regime with >2\u00a0km of overburden, rather than as either penecontemporaneous with deposition or after exhumation by caliche formation, as previously interpreted.\n               ","3":"\n                  Innovations in virtual reality (VR) technology have led to exciting possibilities in teaching earth sciences, allowing students to experience complex geological sites that, due to cost and logistical reasons, they would not normally be able to experience. The need for high quality online digital learning resources and blended learning was brought to the forefront during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as courses with a traditional physical field work component were forced to move online and provide alternatives to students. While it is unlikely that virtual field trips (VFT) would be accepted by students as a replacement of real-world fieldwork moving out of the pandemic, research shows promise that using IVR experiences can lead to enhanced learning outcomes in geosciences, warranting its inclusion on the curricula. This paper presents the outputs of a project to improve student learning in complex geological environments using VR. Here we outline a workflow that was developed to collect high resolution imagery using remote sensing to create digital outcrop models (DOM) of complex geological sites. Using this framework, this paper will then explore the use of VR for an investigation of the Husavik Triple Junction, a complex structural site in northern Iceland, explaining how the drone data was converted to a 3D DOM and demonstrating how VR can be used to simulate real world field mapping. Finally, we describe how these IVR activities have been integrated into taught modules at postgraduate level and discuss how the use of IVR experiences can complement existing geoscience curriculum design.\n               ","4":"\n                  Centrifuge analog modeling incorporating thickness variations of d\u00e9collement and overlying sedimentary cover is used to study thrust-wedge evolution on salt-detached contractional systems involving tapered sedimentary cover. From simpler, layer-cake to 3D tapered d\u00e9collement-cover sequences, our models constrain wedge evolution: a more advanced front, where the cover is thicker, promotes differential frontal translation and triggers vertical axis rotation of several hinterland anticlines which appear towards the thinner cover area. In all cases, the d\u00e9collement level is strongly sheared and tends to migrate laterally toward the thinner cover areas. Models are compared with previous analog models under normal gravity and the natural example of the South Pyrenean Central salient. All in all, we conclude that a 3D tapered d\u00e9collement-cover basin architecture, as a sole factor, can determine the formation of a thrust salient formed by increasing structural curvature (progressive arc).\n               ","5":"\n                  The occurrence of Middle Triassic extensional and strike-slip tectonics has been widely recognized in the Dolomites and is supported by stratigraphic evidence. Contrarily, the recognition of Triassic contractional tectonic structures is less straightforward because such structures were heavily superimposed by Neogene Alpine shortening.\n                  In this work we provide a detailed analysis of a top-class outcrop displaying a syn-sedimentary Middle Triassic extensional fault that displaces a coeval sedimentary m\u00e9lange containing an olistholith of Lower Triassic rocks, characterized by Triassic contractional structures (folds, axial plane cleavage, joints, local thrust faults ornamented with slickenfibers and associated with forced folds).\n                  In particular, integrating geological field mapping and structural analyses, structural analyses on a 3D virtual outcrop model and microstructural analyses, we demonstrate that: 1) the orientation of tectonic structures in the olistholith is at odd with that of regional structures, implying that deformation occurred prior to deposition of the melange; 2) folds and small-scale thrusts in the olistholith developed in lithified rocks, pointing to the existence of Middle Triassic fold and thrust tectonics. In summary, the tectonic structures in the analyzed olistholith represent an outstanding, possibly unique, example of fully preserved, practically frozen, Middle Triassic contractional structures.\n               ","6":"\n                  Feldspar dominates the middle and lower continental crust. Models of crustal rheology depend on our knowledge of feldspar deformation mechanisms. To learn more about natural feldspar deformation, we conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of a brittle-ductile transition (BDT) hosted within a Cretaceous pluton in the Colorado River Extensional Corridor, southern Nevada. Here, a distinct BDT was observed at \u223c10\u00a0km paleo-depth, where brittle faulting transitioned to discrete, localized ductile shearing. Field relationships confirm this BDT to have deformed and exhumed in the Miocene, temporally associated with the intrusion of two surrounding ca. 16 Ma plutons and subsequent footwall rotation in an east-directed normal-fault system. We established the overall structural framework, strain rates, and thermal histories through field traverses, aluminum-in-hornblende barometry to reconstruct paleo-depth, zircon (U\u2013Th)\/He thermochronology (ZHe) to constrain temperature-time histories, and 1D thermal models to further resolve deformation temperatures. Localized shear zones within the BDT formed ca. 16.2\u201315.5\u00a0Ma at temperatures of \u223c500\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C, which continued deforming as they cooled both conductively and advectively to \u223c200\u00a0\u00b0C by ca. 14 Ma, as constrained by ZHe dates. Strain was concentrated in fine-grained (7\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) feldspar-rich ultramylonites that were interpreted to have primarily deformed via grain-size-sensitive diffusion creep. Grain-size reduction that allowed activation of diffusion creep likely resulted from brittle cataclasis, fluid-assisted fracturing and neocrystallization, and dislocation creep mechanisms, thus emphasizing the importance of these processes to localize deformation at relatively strong mid-crust conditions to facilitate the development of diffusion-creep shear zones. Grain-size piezometers suggest stresses of \u223c50\u00a0MPa, which are significantly weaker than peak strength in quartz-rich BDTs that deform via dislocation creep. This integrated process allows relatively low viscosities (\u223c1018\u20131019\u00a0Pa\u00a0s) at lower crust temperatures and explains a coherent process of strain localization at near-BDT conditions in feldspar-dominated lithologies. We suggest that this naturally deformed feldspar shear zone was preserved due to the unique geologic history with fast heating and exhumation, which froze both brittle vs crystal-plastic structures to provide valuable insights into mechanisms of feldspar deformation.\n               ","7":"\n                  Wing fractures and solution surfaces formed in the vicinity of sliding fault tips are natural examples of mixed-mode fracture propagation. Classical fracture propagation models neglect the remote and crack frictional stresses and have limitations on estimating the kink angles of wing fractures from frictional interfaces under compression. Other methods, utilizing the cohesive end zone, improve the match with the field observations. However, limitations still exist for predicting the angles of wing fractures and solution surfaces simultaneously.\n                  We analyze the near-tip stress field including the non-singular terms to estimate the kink angles of wing fracture and solution surface. The estimated kink angles of wing fractures from closed fractures are smaller than the angles from open fractures, agreeing well with the experimental results. The introduced approach predicts that the greater the friction coefficient the smaller the kink angle. The predicted angle between a wing fracture and a solution surface varies between 90\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 depending on the remote stress ratio and the friction coefficient. From the published image of wing fractures and stylolites in limestone in Southern France, we were able to estimate the friction coefficient of the sliding faults and the relative magnitude of the horizontal stresses.\n               ","8":"\n                  Fault-propagation folding occurs when a shallow fold is created by an underlying propagating thrust fault. These structures are common features of fold and thrust belts and hold key economic relevance as groundwater or hydrocarbon reservoirs. Reconstructing a fault-propagation fold is commonly done by means of the trishear model of the forelimb, a theoretical approach that assumes simplistic rheological rock properties. Here we present a series of numerical models that elucidate the kinematics of fault-propagation folding within an anisotropic sedimentary cover using complex visco-elasto-plastic rheologies. We explore the influence of different parameters like cohesion, angle of internal friction, and viscosity during folding and compare the velocity field with results from the purely kinematic trishear model. In the trishear paradigm, fault-propagation folding features a triangular shear zone ahead of the fault tip whose width is defined by the apical angle that in practice serves as a freely tunable fitting parameter. In agreement with this framework, a triangular zone of concentrated strain forms in all numerical models. We use our models to relate the apical angle to the rheological properties of the modeled sedimentary layers. In purely visco-plastic models, the geometry of the forelimb obtained can be approximated using a trishear kinematic model with high apical angles ranging between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. However, additionally accounting for elastic deformation produces a significant change in the geometry of the beds that require lower apical angles (25\u00b0) for trishear kinematics. We conclude that all analyzed numerical models can be represented by applying the theoretical trishear model, whereby folds involving salt layers require high apical angle values while more competent sedimentary rocks need lower values.\n               ","9":"\n                  In carbonates, fault zones strongly influence local reservoir properties and act as drains or barriers to flows. In the case of reactivated faults, newly developed fracture and fault systems rework and cross-cut pre-existing fault structures. The modifications of initial damage zone and fault core properties alter the fault zone properties and potentially created new fluid pathways. This study of the polyphase Castellas fault zone, developed as normal and later reactivated as strike slip, characterizes the structural pattern related to tectonic reactivation, and estimates the hydraulic behaviour of the fault zone through time. This fault affects carbonates located on La Fare anticlinal (SE France). High resolution mapping, 848 measurements and cross-sections allowed to discriminate the fault structures and the lateral heterogeneity of its architecture. Along the 850m-long studied damage zone we identify 8 principal fault planes, 2 relay zones, 19 secondary fault planes, and fault lenses. The study shows that the fault zone developed as isolated fault segments during the normal activity and acted as a drain to fluid flows during its nucleation. Later strike-slip reactivation led to the main structures visible presently as a well-connected fracture network and un-cemented breccia allowing the fault to be a drain to fluid flows.\n               ","10":"\n                  To investigate mechanisms causing microseismicity (Mw\u00a0<\u00a02) at a CO2 injection site, a large-scale triaxial block experiment was carried out on a faulted (saw-cut) cubic-meter of Castlegate Sandstone. The experiment consisted of injection tests at varying differential stresses, while monitoring and recording pore pressure and acoustic emissions (AEs). During the experiment, \u223c33,000 AEs and \u223c14\u00a0mm of horizontal displacement\/slip, like a strike-slip fault movement, occurred. To understand the AE responses and ascertain fault characteristics near the located AEs, we modeled the topography of the fault surface, fault aperture, and fault-gouge thickness using pre- and post-experiment laser scans of the fault surface on each half of the block. Additionally, we characterized surface roughness parallel and perpendicular to slip. Models show crushing and flattening of the fault surfaces can be linked to the spatiotemporal distribution of AEs within 50\u00a0mm of the fault surface. Approximately 65% of AEs were in areas with small aperture (\u2264300\u00a0\u03bcm); thicker fault gouge was observed in adjacent areas with wider aperture and shows a two-fold reduction in grain size relative to unaltered Castlegate Sandstone. This work provides a conceptual understanding on fault surface evolution, which can be applied towards modeling of seismic slip.\n               ","11":"\n                  We report on a series of small-scale, en-\u00e9chelon faults in limestone (Les Matelles, France) that result in the formation of a series of linked pull-aparts (en-\u00e9chelon pull-apart arrays) that have been infilled with calcite. The formation of stylolite seams and isolated veins occurs adjacent to these fault zones, which constrain the direction of minimum infinitesimal stretching axis (commonly interpreted as maximum compressional stress). We observe that en-\u00e9chelon pull-apart arrays occur when the maximum infinitesimal shortening direction is at 55\u00b0 or greater to the enveloping surfaces of the en-\u00e9chelon fault arrays. This situation differs from en-\u00e9chelon vein arrays, in which the maximum horizontal infinitesimal shortening direction occurs at 55\u00b0 or less to the enveloping surfaces. We interpret these features with respect to transpressional strain modeling, which distinguishes between wrench (simple shear) dominated transpression and pure shear dominated transpression. Pure shear dominated transpression occurs if the maximum infinitesimal shortening direction is at 55\u00b0 or greater to the enveloping surfaces, and results in a maximum infinitesimal stretching direction that is vertical. The formation of en-\u00e9chelon vein arrays with vertical enveloping surfaces require a horizontal infinitesimal stretching direction, which is incompatible with pure shear dominated transpression. Rather, en-\u00e9chelon pull-apart arrays form to accommodate the wrench component of deformation in pure-shear dominated transpression.\n               ","12":"\n                  Systematic analysis of the complexity of fracture systems, especially for three-dimensional (3D) fracture networks, is largely insufficient. In this work, we generate different fracture networks with various geometries with a stochastic discrete fracture network method. The fractal dimension (D) and the singularity variation in a multifractal spectrum (\u0394\u03b1) are utilized to quantify the complexity of fracture networks in different aspects (spatial filling and heterogeneity). Influential factors of complexity, including geometrical fracture properties and system size, are then systematically studied. We generalize the analysis by considering two critical (percolative and over-percolative) stages of fracture networks. At the first stage, \u03ba (fracture orientation) is the most significant parameter for D, following a (fracture length) and L (system size). F\n                     \n                        D\n                      (fracture positions) has a weak correlation with D but a strong correlation with \u0394\u03b1. At the second stage, the sensitivity results of each geometrical parameter and the system size are the same as in stage one for D. For \u0394\u03b1, \u03ba and F\n                     \n                        D\n                      become more significant. For both stages, there is a weak finite-size effect for D and no finite-size effect for \u0394\u03b1. Therefore, a large fracture system is more suitable for a stable fractal dimension estimation, but no requirement for the estimation of \u0394\u03b1. D and \u0394\u03b1 are almost independent. Therefore, they can separately quantify different aspects of complexity.\n               ","13":"\n                  Fault zones in crystalline rocks generally possess a relatively narrow (<50-cm-thick) fault core (i.e., a fault gouge layer\/zone). However, the Geumwang Fault, a major strike-slip fault developed in granitic rocks in Korea, has a wider (\u223c24-m-thick) fault core with several gouge layers. Here we conduct detailed field and microanalytical investigations on the fault core of the Geumwang Fault. Results showed that some of the gouges are primary gouges in which seismic slip was localized as the principal slip zones (PSZs), whereas others are secondary gouges that formed by the injection of fluidized gouge material into fractures. Within the PSZs, the presence of amorphous carbon and graphite implies that frictional heat generated by coseismic slip triggered siderite decomposition. It was likely the consequence of gouge fluidization induced by thermal pressurization under fluid drained conditions. In addition, the gouge fluidization seems to neutralize the foliation of the PSZ. This process, together with weakening of the damage zone by long-term alteration, may facilitate subsequent seismic slip occurred along foliated breccia or the fault core boundary rather than the former neutralized PSZs, thereby widening the Geumwang Fault. We propose that coseismic fluidization of PSZ by thermal pressurization can act as a potential mechanism to widen the fault core and generate multiple gouge layers in crystalline rocks.\n               ","14":"\n                  Traditional strain analysis assumes that a particle deforms affinely with its matrix and that the magnitude and geometry of particle deformation are representative of the bulk strain. However, there are forces, lumped together under the terms of competency or viscosity contrast, which oppose particle deformation. For small weak particles, surface tension may also be important in resisting particle deformation. We performed analogue model experiments to investigate the effect of surface tension on the deformation of a weak viscous particle (bubble or droplet) enclosed in a viscous matrix. The experiments were performed using a ring-shear apparatus allowing large magnitudes of plane strain, simple shear. The results demonstrate the controlling influence of capillary number on particle deformation. The particles did not continuously elongate with increasing shear strain but achieved a steady-state value dependent on capillary number. Because capillary number represents the ratio of shear stresses, which deform particles, to the surface (interfacial) stresses restraining elongation, there should be a strong dependence of particle strain on the deformed particle size and bulk strain rate. The most important geological implications of this study are in the field of melt segregation in deforming anatectic systems.\n               ","15":"\n                  Coupling of deformation and magmatism has been widely reported in several old orogenic belts, particularly along faults and shear zones. The syn-kinematic plutons in exhumed shear zones offer the best opportunity to understand the complex relationship between magmatism and regional deformation. The present paper investigates the geometry and internal structure of granite plutons emplaced in thrust faults and shear zones, and structural control on their emplacement mechanism. Abu Ziran pluton is an example of the intrusions emplaced in an active brittle-ductile thrust shear zone in the Nubian shield, and documents clear evidence on the interaction between magmatism and deformation during melt ascent and emplacement. Results from detailed geological mapping, remote sensing and structural analysis of the pluton permitted the constraining of the pluton's geometry, emplacement mechanism, and spatio-temporal evolution. Structural analysis indicates that pluton emplacement was syn-to-late-tectonic. The brittle-ductile fabrics in the wall rock are consistent with a sub-horizontal thrust shear zone with a top-to-NW shear sense. The activity of the shear zone was accompanied by an episode of a calc-alkaline magmatic pulse. Granitic magma ascended upward via non-exposed feeder dykes, or through ramps and flats in the thrust system and emplaced laterally along the shear zone, forming complex sub-horizontal sheet-shaped intrusion. The geometry and extent of pluton emphasize that inherited heterogeneities and regional stress states played important role in the emplacement processes. In addition, localization of pluton along or near the contact between ophiolitic nappes and mylonitic metasediments suggests that the rheological boundaries act as barriers that impede the rise of ascending magma, causing magma arrest and trigger lateral spreading and emplacement. The outcomes of this study allowed the reconstruction of the geometry and internal structure of Abu Ziran pluton and grasping its evolution in space and time.\n               ","16":"\n                  Despite over three-decades of active research and wide debate in the published literature, the mechanisms that govern the growth of polygonal faults are poorly understood. Here we investigate the growth of polygonal faults using a suite of geomechanical finite element forward models that couple dynamic fault propagation, sedimentation, and the mechanical compaction of unconsolidated granular sediment. We undertook a suite of numerical model simulations to explore the relationships between varying fault plane dip, residual friction of the fault, and the bulk material properties of the sedimentary sequence hosting the polygonal fault system. We find that the growth of polygonal faults within laterally-pinned sedimentary tiers can be explained by gravity-driven differential compaction and does not require additional causative elements to explain the gross pattern of strain accumulation. We also find that the magnitude of fault throw is influenced by the material properties and the original fault plane dip, but is most sensitive to the residual friction angle. Our models yield values for maximum throw versus height for the faults that fall within the range of global values compiled for polygonal faults, and throw rates are comparable to those recently measured in naturally occurring polygonal faults.\n               ","17":"\n                  Curved fold-and-thrust belt (CFTB) is a common structural phenomenon in orogenic belts and accretionary wedges, which has attracted the attention of several geologists. However, the formation mechanism of CFTB, particularly the cause of Pamir salient, has been greatly controversial. Therefore, based on previous studies, CFTB was studied by 12 groups of analogue modeling using the different shapes of the backstop and variable basal friction properties, and different compression velocities. The results show that the formation of CFTB is closely associated with the initial geometric characteristics of CFTB, the strength of the basal ductile layer, and the influence of lateral friction. Although the variation in backstop geometries is dominated by the pure Coulomb wedge, CFTB with completely different structural styles can form because of different boundary shapes. The CFTB formed by lower basement friction strength has a larger deformation range, and the CFTB formed by high strength of basal friction, which is narrow, has a high uplift amplitude, forming a tensile structure around its uplift. A high compressional rate forms the higher arc curvature, and a lower compressional rate forms the smaller arc curvature. Models of a brittle basement with triangular backstop and models with ductile basement and boundary parallel to the compression direction may provide a more reliable explanation for the formation of the forward thrust, backward thrust, and symmetrical pop-up structures of the Pamir salient and its structural vergence from south to north. This study further reveals that initial boundary geometry, stratigraphic structure, and rheology with a difference in brittle and ductile layers will yield more complex structural styles and different kinematic characteristics.\n               ","18":"\n                  We propose a novel method to reconstruct the six parameters of the paleostress tensor.

Owing to its outstanding 3D exposures, we selected Panasqueira Mine, central Portugal, as natural laboratory to develop and test our approach. We measured 684 quartz veins, \u223c800 FIs in quartz and the geochemical composition of 10 arsenopyrite samples. The inversion of the veins resulted in a reverse stress regime with \u03c31 trending\u00a0\u223c\u00a0NW-SE, \u03a6\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and a driving stress ratio of R\u2019\u00a0=\u00a00.19.

Finally, the adjustment of the Mohr circle resulted in differential stresses too low to trigger shear failure and in the range from 45 to 89\u00a0MPa, and pore pressures exceeding lithostatic pressure by 8.5\u201317\u00a0MPa to open the discontinuities during MOSS-MSS mineralisations.\n               ","19":"\n                  When working with geological maps and cross-sections, and no kinematic criteria on fault motion are available, we usually classify the type of fault (dip-slip, strike-slip, oblique) according to the observed separation of planar markers, usually bedding. Although in many cases the separation agrees with fault slip, and therefore, the deduced type of fault is correct, these deductions can be completely wrong in certain circumstances. Amongst other parameters, the observed separation depends on the angular relationship between the cut-off line of the planar marker on the fault plane and the slip vector. In this paper, we elaborate on this relationship and present a tool to facilitate classifications of faults whose motion does not involve rotation of the fault blocks, and cut and offset previously tilted or folded surfaces. This tool consists of graphs that predict how the observed separation will be in cross sections and maps. In addition, the influence of different parameters on the magnitude of the separation in a geological section across a fault is discussed. The validity of the presented tool is demonstrated through its application to two field examples of strike-slip faults offsetting inclined layers and a fold train in the Asturian Basin.

We used digital outcrop models to perform a quantitative assessment of connectivity using a UAV-based system at the Melancias outcrop, Rio do Peixe Basin, Brazil. Topology determined the frequency, intensity and dimensionless intensity of deformation bands in three circular windows visually analyzed and interpreted. The geometry of the bands defines the proportion of node types, influences the distribution of I-, Y- and X-nodes, and controls the connectivity of fractures along the outcrop. Results provided by geometric and topological analyses corroborate connection per line as the more reliable connectivity indicator. Furthermore, they were crucial to defining the northeast sector as a corridor to fluid flow, whereas the other two sectors tend to be permeability barriers. We also analyzed the influence of trace lengths on the band network's overall orientation and geometric arrangement.

Nearly all published examples of flanking structures are interpreted to have formed either under simple shear or transpressional general shear, although theoretically they should also form under transtensional general shear. This paper describes the geometry and development of transtensional flanking structures in glacial ice of the Pasterze, Austria's largest alpine valley glacier. The cross-cutting elements are a few metres long and are interpreted as fractures that rotate into the shear flow and consequently accommodate anti- and synthetic offset, forming a- and s-type flanking folds. However, shear bands, with co-shearing cross-cutting elements inclined against the shear flow, are absent. The geometries of the mapped structures are successfully reproduced with a semi-analytical modified Eshelby solution for a frictionless cross-cutting element embedded in a linear viscous medium deforming under a remote transtensional sub-simple shear. The geometry of the mapped flanking folds, the absence of shear bands, the spatial variation of cross-cutting element orientations and the geometry of the glacier's splaying crevasses are consistent with two-dimensional transtensional sub-simple shear caused by down-glacier valley widening.\n               ","24":"\n                  A structural analysis of a key area along the Waterberg Thrust in northern Namibia clarifies its geometric and timing relationships to the deposition of rift-related Karoo sediments.

Detailed mapping and kinematic analysis have been used to construct and restore several sections across the thrust that put initiation of reverse offset as a thrust in Triassic time. Thin-skinned footwall deformation created several unconformities in a footwall cutoff system. The unconformities were subsequently folded during continued motion on the fault. Various dating techniques constrain the initiation of contractional deformation to the Triassic to Jurassic (Karoo time) with episodic progression during the development of the basin, followed by major further reactivation during regional uplift related to the Atlantic margin rifting and subsequent continental breakup.

The second set of fringes, developed after the tilting of the main foliation and the first fringe-set in a sub-vertical orientation, records a lower absolute rotation of the core-object (25\u00b0), a lower shear strain (\u03b3) of about 1.4 and a coaxial strain associated with the vertical shortening. This part of the composite fringe system and the related structures may relate to the switch from the crustal scale contractional regime to the extensional one, which characterized the development of the inner northern Apennines orogen.\n               ","26":"\n                  Two-dimensional, plane-strain finite element numerical models produce small normal faults similar to those formed during the Oligocene to Miocene of the salt-cored St. Malo anticline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The mechanical stratigraphy used in the models was derived from well data and a rate-independent, elastic-plastic constitutive model with a non-associated flow rule was used to represent the behavior of weak, over-consolidated rocks. Motion of salt is modeled by displacing the base of the overburden from an initially flat configuration to the observed present-day geometry. Model results using dominantly vertical displacement with minor extension (2%) are consistent with observed faulting at St. Malo. Small amounts of contraction (2\u20135%) in the numerical model suppress normal faulting whereas 2% extension best reproduces the observed structural style. The normal faults develop during elastic-plastic bending and evolve from sub-vertical, plastic mode-I failure zones to dominantly inclined normal faults. Throws of normal faults produced by the numerical models range from 11\u00a0m to 123\u00a0m. By comparison, the throws observed in the crest of the St. Malo anticline range from 30\u00a0m to 300\u00a0m. Models only using vertical displacement develop normal faults with \u226450 m throws due to bending; these are below seismic resolution. Only models with \u22652% extension develop normal faults that would be detectible (i.e., throws \u226550 m). A constraint of all the models is that the top of the salt is not faulted. The maximum depth of normal faulting in the models is ca. 900 m below the top of the reservoir. The maximum throws at the top of the reservoir in the models are ca. 30\u201365\u00a0m. Initiation of the normal faults as plastic mode-I failure zones in the numerical models suggests a mechanism that could facilitate early seal breach, even without juxtaposition of stratal leak points.\n               ","27":"\n                  A new type of structural association comprising periclinal folds is present in thick-bedded calcareous mudstones and siltstones of the Early Cretaceous Hekou Group in the Lanzhou Basin, NW China. The periclinal fold system consists of meso-scale, open anticlines and synclines with fold axial trends in two perpendicular orientations (NE-SW and NW-SE) and two sets of conjugate thrust faults that form intersections in the same two orientations. Folded and faulted layers of the periclinal fold system are not sedimentary bedding surfaces but sub-parallel curviplanar foliations formed by compaction of the original strata soon after deposition. Many folded curviplanar foliations connect with the unfolded, conjugate thrust faults, indicating that faulting was active during and\/or soon after folding. The NE-SW and NW-SE-trending fold axes and fault planes indicate bilateral, subhorizontal contraction acting simultaneously during the formation of the periclinal fold system. In some cases, converging slickenlines on curviplanar foliation planes within anticline cores point to localized isotropic contraction probably caused by scaping fluids and increased hydrostatic pressure. Similarities with the better-known polygonal fault system include development in fine-grained sediments and layer boundness, whereas main differences are a dominance of contractional faults in the periclinal fold system versus extensional faults in the polygonal fault system and a higher consolidation of sediments needed for the development of the periclinal fold system. This study suggests that collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang Blocks combined with oblique convergence and subsequent collision along the southeastern margin of the Eurasian plate following compaction-related volume loss of fine-grained sediments led to the formation of the periclinal fold system in the Hekou Group in the Late Cretaceous.\n               ","28":"\n                  We analyzed from meso-to microscale the chemical interaction (e.g., bleaching) between deep fluids and carbonate rocks in pelagic limestones exposed along the seismically active Gubbio normal fault (Northern Apennines), exhumed from ca. 2\u00a0km depth. Bleaching is enhanced by the exploitation of inherited stylolitic seams by fluids and is favored by the progressive leaching and mobilization of primary components (i.e., Ca, Fe, Pb, and Cu) and the precipitation of authigenic baryte due to temperature and\/or redox potential contrast.\n                  Analysis of fluid inclusions trapped in calcite veins in the damage zone precipitated from a H2O\u2013NaCl-bearing fluid(s), with low salinity (1.22\u20132.57\u00a0wt%NaCleq) and a range of trapping temperature between 107 \u00b0C and 185 \u00b0C, higher than the host rock peak T conditions. Analysis of fluid inclusions and noble gases from syn-kinematic calcite and mineralogy of altered rocks suggests a mixed contribution between crustal-derived fluids with diagenetic fluids containing sulphates and CO2. We speculate that bleaching is a by-product of the circulation of such aggressive fluids with mixed contributions, likely mobilized during seismic event(s) and injected into the damage zone at shallow depths. Such processes, affecting the chemical-physical properties of limestones, are generally underestimated and should be considered when modelling hydraulic connectivity in fractured carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","29":"\n                  New and emerging technologies are changing the world as we know it, and how we choose to perform geologic fieldwork is changing as well. Recent developments in hardware and software provide unprecedented opportunities not only for conventional field studies but also for persons traditionally exempt from field-related research because of mobility issues or inability to travel. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) first allowed digital geologic mapping in the field, and these systems remain in widespread use because of ease of use and ease of data duplication for collaboration in work teams or field classes. We present a general 2D workflow based on GIS approaches that affords opportunities for physically disadvantaged individuals that includes cognitive steps driven by the data assembly process in GIS. Most notable is the digitization of linework and exploration of an area with Google Earth Pro (GEP) as steps, outside the field, that allow assessment of an area to formulate hypotheses that can be done by a physically disadvantaged person as well, or better, than those physically capable of field exploration. We then explore emerging technologies including pseudo-3D viewing using image drapes on an elevation model (aka 2.5D method) and true 3D approaches based on Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry that provide a powerful toolbox back at the office or at base camp that does not require physical abilities or direct field access. These 3D tools are potentially transformative for mobility impaired individuals that could allow them to work individually, or as part of a team, to assess field related problems. For all 3 levels of digital mapping (2D, 2.5D and 3D) we emphasize specific workflows designed to help the researcher perform digital geologic mapping with a specific focus on individuals with limited mobility.

Divalia Fossae, a set of circum-equatorial troughs, were previously proposed to be concentric around the basin, which is widely regarded as evidence that the Rheasilvia impact directly caused the formation of the troughs. Here, we produce a structural map of Rheasilvia that allows for geologic interpretations and quantitative analyses of structure orientations and densities. We mapped basin-bounding scarps, scarps within the basin, ridges, and undefined lineaments. Scarps abound near the basin rim, with ridges being densely located on the basin floor near the central mound, forming a spiral pattern. This pattern is well-preserved on the basin floor except in the area superposing the older Veneneia basin, indicating that pre-existing Veneneia structures substantially influenced those of Rheasilvia. This implies that the lithosphere must have remained highly shattered after the Veneneia impact until Rheasilvia was emplaced. The Divalia Fossae cross-cut the Rheasilvia basin, and reanalysis of the geometric relationship between both landforms reveals that the troughs are not concentric around the basin center. These results are inconsistent with the previous hypothesis of trough formation and require a reconsideration of Vesta's tectonic history.\n               ","31":"\n                  The Ramsay-Graham heterogeneous simple shear zone model revolutionized our understanding of finite strain variation in orogenic belts. Many deeply exhumed (>20\u00a0km depths) shear zones in orogenic continental crust are a consequence of sub-simple shear strain accumulation during contraction and displacement at high temperature. Here we explore the micro-scale record of this process using syn-kinematic monazite in two shear zones in a >20,000\u00a0km2 terrane of exhumed lower continental crust. Field observations combined with high-spatial resolution X-ray mapping, Th\u2013U-Pb electron microprobe petrochronology, and electron backscatter diffraction analysis demonstrate that monazite grains can provide an important textural and temporal record of shear strain in mylonite and ultramylonite gneisses. Monazite grains exhibit aspect ratios of 1.7\u20134.6 parallel to the stretching lineation and parallel or oblique (<30\u00b0) to the penetrative foliation. Monazite EBSD data for grain orientation spread, i.e., average misorientation relative to the mean, are consistent with no significant dislocation-accommodated internal deformation. We conclude that dissolution precipitation creep of monazite produced compositionally-defined geometries compatible with the dextral sense of shear observed in outcrop and thin section. Syn-kinematic rims on monazite grains that develop in low strain domains during accumulation of shear strain can provide absolute ages for \u03bcm-to km-scale kinematics in continental orogens.\n               ","32":"\n                  In this review paper, we compile observations that have been made over decades of research on the Cascadia convergent boundary and re-examine the deformation using structural kinematic models, thereby providing new insights. Deformation in the subducting Juan de Fuca slab and the overriding North American plate is primarily accommodated by fracturing. We show that the along-strike deformation patterns are a function of fracture density and activity, which influences coupling with the overriding North American plate and the underlying mantle wedge. We analyze the deformation within a fracture kinematics framework and show that the orientations of the fractures and motion history follow expected empirical fracture mechanics models and are used to provide a more detailed kinematic history of the Cascadia convergent boundary. We focus on the Gorda plate of the Juan de Fuca subducting slab and show that it is intensely fractured with curved magnetic anomalies such that the brittle deformation is collectively expressed macroscopically as a deforming continuum. The Gorda plate has changed shape via NS shortening and clockwise rotation without losing cohesion at the plate-scale, which suggests that the fractures form an interlocking network to accommodate ductile deformation via cataclastic flow. In the forearc, the fracture and velocity patterns suggest that deformation is accommodated by a continental-scale right-lateral shear zone, trending 320\u00b0\/140\u00b0 and is assisted via crustal-scale cataclastic flow. We suggest that ETS activity is strongly correlated to deformation in the over-riding plate. The Gorda plate is also used to better understand larger-scale plate dynamics. We demonstrate that the Gorda plate acts as a ductile deformation zone to assist global plate mobility. Additionally, details of the magnetic lineation patterns in the Gorda plate indicate that slab pull overtakes plate rotation post-subduction. This suggests that plate behavior is strongly influenced by its internal deformation and coupling with the mantle post-subduction.\n               ","33":"\n                  Glacier surging provides a window into the processes responsible for some of the fastest ice flow on Earth. Surge-type glaciers are festooned with fold trains\u2014many visible from space\u2014which encode the history of polyphase deformation associated with this form of episodic fast flow. We conduct the first investigation of the kinematic evolution of these kilometre-scale folds using a full-Stokes numerical ice-flow model. We model the folds through multiple surge cycles within a set of synthetic glacier confluence configurations, and identify how differences in glacier flow regimes imprint themselves on three-dimensional fold geometry. Based on simulation results across parameter space, we present an archetype of kinematic evolution that describes the transition from cylindrical vertically plunging gentle folds emplaced during the surge phase, to complex depth-varying folds following multiple cycles of surging and quiescent flow. A detailed examination of the surface trace of these folds highlights the links between glacier flow regime and folding. The initial fold geometry is controlled by longitudinal and lateral shear stress regimes during surging, while fold evolution is governed primarily by lateral shearing after emplacement. This reflects the influence of valley geometry and glacier dynamics on the variability of flow regimes during both surging and quiescent flow. Finally, we illustrate the potential of our approach to reconstruct more complex fold geometries as observed in nature.\n               ","34":"\n                  We describe the localized folding of thick layers embedded in a viscoelastic framework. Higher-order partial differential equations such as the Swift-Hohenberg equation are standard for modelling the folding process. Using a high-order shear theory, we modify the Swift-Hohenberg equation to describe the buckling of thick layers and consider the folded layer's viscoelastic behavior. The use of thick layers enables us to consider shear strains parallel to the layers during folding. Our model naturally captures the softening-stiffening behavior by including a non-linear viscoelastic description using a Winkler-type foundation. Next, we study the linear stability behavior of the system and derive the dispersion relations. Finally, we simulate this new model using a robust custom-built isogeometric analysis solver, which allows us to describe thick folded layers with localized folding. The numerical results show that the folding of an elastic layer produces periodic patterns while a viscoelastic layer deflects locally. When the horizontal forces are unequal, the periodic folds initiate in the direction of the smaller force and the localized deformations occur parallel to the larger force. Later, the nonlocal deformation occurs in the direction of a smaller force. Domes and basins or more linear ridges and valleys are formed according to the relative magnitudes of the applied forces. Domes and basins are the results of equal horizontal applied forces, and non-equal forces result in ridges and valleys.\n               ","35":"\n                  Faults in volcanic areas can have different origins and can form due to several volcano-tectonic processes. In this work, by means of detailed field observations, we analysed a fault array cutting through a recent pyroclastic succession in the Campi Flegrei caldera of southern Italy to investigate its origin. Geometric and kinematic data indicate that the fault array consists of steeply dipping faults with both normal and reverse senses of movement. Displacement data suggest that these faults with opposed kinematics acted together , in agreement with what was previously described from analogue and numerical experiments for faults formed in response to gravitational collapses in volcanic areas. By integrating these results with considerations of the recent volcano-tectonic evolution of the Campi Flegrei caldera, we propose a model in which the studied fault array developed to accommodate a gravitational collapse triggered by an underground magma migration predating the 1538 CE historical Monte Nuovo eruption. This work is, to our knowledge, the first thorough field description of faults developed to accommodate gravitational collapses in volcanic areas.\n               ","36":"\n                  Geologic gas storage is a sustainable strategy to store energy in underground reservoirs in order to be used under demand. Injection and withdrawal gas operations could trigger induced seismicity according to the tectonic constrains of the reservoir. The study of the active stress\/strain fields shows the properties of the fault patterns that can be involved in induced seismicity. In our work, we have determined the strain\/stress field in the Yela underground gas storage, an Upper Cretaceous carbonate reservoir located in central Spain. Slickensides on fault planes were measured from Cretaceous, Miocene and Quaternary rocks. Results show a strain field with ey (maximum horizontal shortening) oriented NW-SE. This field was compressional during the early Miocene, switching off to extensional from late Miocene to present-day. Our results suggest that NNW-SSE and NW-SE oriented faults could act as an effective pathway for gas leakage and prone to trigger induced seismicity. Moreover, 141 small earthquakes (Mmax 2.3) were recorded during underground operations in Yela. Peaks of earthquakes appear seasonally from November to February, in coincidence with the injection operations prior to the winter withdrawal. Working at its maximum gas storage volume, earthquake peaks decreased in intensity and magnitude from 2017 to 2021, and show a time lag of 3 months from the month of maximum volume injection to the earthquake occurrence.\n               ","37":"\n                  Stylolites are rough dissolution surfaces that show three different scaling regimes in space and time. On the small scale surface energy dominates and stylolites roughen very slowly with a growth exponent of about 0.5 and a roughness exponent of about 1.0. On the intermediate scale elastic energy dominates and the surfaces roughening is happening faster with a growth exponent of about 0.8 and a roughness exponent of about 0.5. The transitional length between these two scaling regimes is determined by the stress during stylolite growth and termed as cross-over length scale. On the large scale another transition is reached beyond which the stylolite amplitude remains constant, this length scale is termed the correlation length. The correlation length is determined by time of growth or by the amount of compaction that happened at the interface as well as by the stylolite's system size. This length scale grows as a function of time and the dynamic exponent, which is about 2 in the surface energy dominated regime and 0.625 in the elastic energy dominated regime. We present examples of these scaling regimes for numerical as well as natural stylolites and show how the exponents can be used to determine the stylolite compaction through the different regimes. The numerical stylolites show an increase of correlation length as a function of system size in self-affine time series. Large samples of natural tectonic stylolites from Jurassic limestones of the Franconian Alb (SE Germany) exhibit all three scaling regimes in a self-affine space series. The important length scales in the natural system are the grain size or noise at 30\u00a0\u03bcm, the cross-over length between the surface and elastic energy dominated regimes at 1.4\u00a0mm and the correlation length at 5.7\u00a0cm.

Structural investigations at different scales, flow kinematics, and finite strain analyses are fundamental tools to determine how deformation is accommodated and partitioned. Spatial temperature variations can be responsible for the dynamic weakening and strain localization in the crust, therefore understanding the thermal conditions of shearing and deformation is critical. We integrate field observations, meso- and microstructural analyses, kinematic vorticity estimations, and finite strain data with a quantitative thermometric analysis by Raman spectroscopy on carbonaceous material along a ductile shear zone: the Barbagia Thrust (BT) in the hinterland-foreland transition zone of the Sardinian Variscan belt. These analyses, performed in two different parts of the shear zone, yield similar finite strain gradients, albeit with an increasing component of simple shear with increasing temperature, highlighting the feedback between temperature and vorticity. Our results best fits with a tectonic scenario with shear heating, where higher magnitude gradients correspond to higher vorticity and finite strain values, which indicate greater shear and heating values. The heating quantified along the BT\u00a0(~50\u00b0C) is compared favorably to numerical and mechanical models.

However, their effects on formation and activation of these wedge front fault systems remain poorly understood. This study presents three sets of sandbox experiments in which topographic loading and geometry of inherited faults were first separately investigated, then explored jointly. Experiments show that smaller topographic loading favors gentle-dipping wedge front thrusts, while larger topographic loading promotes the development of steep wedge front faults. Introduced as zones of frictional weakness, all inherited faults promote deformation localization, though the steep ones are characterized by buttressing nearby rather than direct slip on themselves. When the two factors were tested integrally, four major deformation modes arose, including (1) direct reactivation; (2) fault truncation in the initial stage of compression; (3) stacking of small thrusts against the inherited fault and possible truncation in a later evolutionary stage; (4) behavior as a fossil structure. These modes show differences not only in first-order deformation styles, but also in the distribution of secondary structures, defining a basic framework and providing new guides for the interpretation of complex wedge front fault systems and their activities, in areas such as the Longmen Shan (eastern Tibet), the Tian Shan and the western margin of the Taiwan orogen.\n               ","41":"\n                  It is generally accepted that grain boundary sliding (GBS) is the dominant deformation mechanism in fine-grained strain localization zones. However, the lifetime of GBS during deformation in monomineralic rocks is hotly debated, as grain growth may inhibit the operation of GBS. In this contribution, recrystallized matrix grains in calcite marbles from the Jinzhou detachment fault zone at the middle crustal level, Liaodong Peninsula, Northeast China, show clear evidence of GBS, e.g., 1) fine grains with sizes of 5\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm, nearly equant grain shapes and slightly curved grain boundaries, 2) rare evidence for intracrystalline deformation, 3) existence of four-grain junctions and aligned straight grain boundaries, and 4) weak crystallographic preferred orientations. The existence of high misorientation zones along the margins of the matrix grains, especially at their triple junctions, and differences in cathodoluminescence (CL) characteristics between rims and cores of the grains indicate simultaneous accommodation of GBS by dislocation motion and grain boundary diffusion. The different CL characteristics between rims and cores of calcite matrix grains and the presence of calcite-filled cracks imply fluid activity during deformation. Fluids could dramatically enhance GBS by promoting dislocation motion and grain boundary diffusion. Additionally, the nucleation of fine grains by dynamic recrystallization and cavitation-sealing processes during GBS guaranteed the maintenance of GBS. At the same time, the occurrence of micropores and the existence of second phases also inhibit grain growth. These features make GBS the dominant deformation mechanism in naturally deformed marbles in the middle-upper crust.\n               ","42":"\n                  In this study, we report how criteria inferred from structural and kinematic analysis of shear zone fabrics can be instrumental in deciphering events of positive or negative inversion tectonics.

In particular, S-fabrics result from selective transpressional-reactivation of pre-thrusting normal faults. By contrast, more complex composite fabrics, characterized by folded cleavage, reveal a history of negative inversion tectonics. Mesocopic cleavage folding is ascribed to shear-sense reversal along the shear surfaces during extensional reactivation of pre-existing thrusts; or to synthetic reactivation by listric foreland-dipping normal faults, merging downwards on former thrust surfaces during protracted episodes of gravitational collapse.\n                  Shear zone fabrics identification criteria, here illustrated from thrusts of different size, if systematically used, may be diagnostic of different deformation paths, and hence provide useful tools to elucidate the tectonic history of curved thrust systems in orogens that have experienced multiple episodes of inversion.\n               ","43":"\n                  Since the pioneering works of John Ramsay in the 1970's and 1980's, the analysis of exceptional exposures of small-scale shear zones (i.e. 10-3 \u2013 10\u22121\u00a0m thick) in granitoid rocks provided invaluable insights into the processes controlling strain localisation in the middle and lower continental crust. Indeed, recent advancement in field, microstructural and petrological analyses of such small-scale shear zone have shed new light on the metamorphic, tectonic and fluid conditions promoting shear zone nucleation and development in granitoid rocks. In this paper we provide an overview of these new insights, comparing and integrating the results obtained from field, and microstructural and petrological analyses of small-scale shear zones in granitoid plutons and meta-granitoids from the Alps. A review of the deformation temperature shows that the granitoid shear zones development occurs between 350 and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, with most of them localising in a restricted temperature window between 450 and 500\u00a0\u00b0C. At these conditions, the magmatic assemblage is metastable and subjected to a series of metamorphic reactions. Furthermore, the development of shear zone does not occur under-closed system conditions. Introducing or expelling fluids and mass (i.e. metasomatism) during deformation has mineralogical consequences that control the rheology and the way shear zone evolves. Among the main mineralogical and microstructural changes, the breakdown of magmatic feldspar(s) into fine-grained aggregates steers both the rheology and fabric evolution of shear zones in granitoid rocks, triggering further mechano-chemical feedback mechanisms. Future research should consider the occurrence of feedback processes between deformation, metamorphic and metasomatic processes to understand and quantify the evolution with time and strain of shear zone geometry and rheology, as well as of the development of larger-scale shear zone networks.\n               ","44":"\n                  The Kuqa fold-thrust belt arguably hosts Earth's highest density of diverse surface salt structures, including salt-cored anticlines, strike-slip faults that double as salt walls, salt domes, and salt thrusts. Key aspects of the structural development of the range are unresolved. In particular, it is unclear whether the fold-thrust belt developed via forward-propagating salt-cored detachment folds which locally nucleated late thrust faults, or if such detachment folds grew interspersed with either (i) long-lived pre-kinematic salt diapirs that evolved into local salt thrusts and\/or (ii) source-fed thrust faults and associated folds. Detachment folds and hanging wall anticlines of source-fed thrusts feature gradual lateral propagation during growth, whereas diapirs either lack lateral propagation or involve irregular propagation and dramatic strain gradients. Therefore, we test the hypotheses by examining potential geomorphological records of lateral ridge propagation along the frontal Kuqa fold-thrust belt. A particular focus is the Quele salt thrust, because it spans one tenth of the length of the frontal belt and it is commonly hypothesized to represent a deformed diapir or a source-fed thrust fault. We find that all ridges along the frontal Kuqa fold-thrust belt feature (1) bow-shaped along-strike topography, with decreasing relief from the topographic crest to the plunging ends of the ridges, (2) curved wind and water gaps, (3) asymmetric fan-shaped and forked-shaped tributaries, and (4) drainage basin maturity decreases towards lateral ridge terminations. These features are consistent with lateral fold propagation. At the Quele salt thrust, such evidence indicates that the hanging wall developed as two distinct anticlines which merged into a composite anticlinorium. Our findings indicate that the frontal Kuqa fold-thrust belt developed either by detachment folding with local late thrust fault formation, or via such structures interspersed with source-fed thrust faults.\n               ","45":"\n                  The Mt.

We investigate them using a coupled single-bubble mechanical\/reaction-transport numerical and analytical models. We demonstrate that inner pressure of the growing bubble at fracturing, concentration at its surface, bubble size and spatial location, are uniquely defined by the Fracture Toughness of muddy sediment. However, a temporal evolution of the bubble inner pressure at expansion between the fracturing events depends on the Young's modulus. Fracture Toughness and Young's modulus thus play complementary, spatial and temporal, roles in the bubble inner pressure evolution. The proportionality suggested by LEFM manages the bubble solute exchange and growth rates. Higher Fracture Toughness controls development of longer flatter bubbles in the deeper sediments. A substantial role of the mechanical muddy sediment characteristics in the CH4 bubble growth dynamics and solute exchange is demonstrated, comparable to the role of the biogeochemical controls. Their contributions to development of no-growth and competitive bubble growth conditions, affecting a gas dynamics at a macro-scale, are discussed.\n               ","48":"\n                  The Qingyi ductile shear zone is located in the Western Shandong Province, North China Craton, and it strikes NNW-SSE with a nearly vertical mylonitic foliation and horizontal stretching lineation. This shear zone is characterized by dextral strike-slip shearing. The estimated kinematic vorticity numbers of the studied mylonites ranging from 0.79 to 0.99 indicate that the shear zone is dominated by simple shear. Microstructures, quartz fabrics and mineral assemblages reveal that this shear zone is developed in upper greenschist facies with deformation temperatures of 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00b0C. Zircon U\u2013Pb data of mylonites and a late-kinematic vein constrain the timing of shearing at \u223c2501\u00a0Ma. Biotite 40Ar\/39Ar age data of the late-kinematic vein suggest the end of late tectono-thermal events and crustal stabilisation at \u223c1878\u00a0Ma. Based on the geometry, kinematics and geochronology, the Qingyi ductile shear zone is interpreted to result from microblock amalgamation and indicates a horizontal tectonic regime of the Western Shandong Province during the late Neoarchean period.\n               ","49":"\n                  Most models of brittle boudinage predict a dependency of fracture spacing on thickness of the boudinaged layer. This basic relationship can be distorted in the case of multiphase boudinage, where structural inheritance, possibly combined with time evolution of rheology affects boudin geometries, but is not recognized in 2D outcrops. Here we present analyses from a metre-scale, serially sectioned sample of marble from Naxos, Greece, containing a layer of amphibolite, which is known to have experienced two phases of ductile drawn boudinage followed by five generations of brittle boudinage. We show that brittle boudinage depends on the ratio of grain size and layer thickness of the amphibolite. In very thin layers (few grains across), strain is diffuse throughout the entire layer, leading to macroscopically homogeneous stretching. Strain localisation starts when layer thickness exceeds 5 grains: narrow tensile necks and shear zones (35\u201345\u00b0 dip) develop where the layer is\u00a0<\u00a010\u201320 grains thick. Thicker layers (<30\u201340 grains) show extensional (mode 1) fractures while shear fractures form in even thicker layers. The absence of shear fractures in thinner layers may be explained by a geometry-related compressive stress decrease in the pinches. This results in localised shear evolving only in thicker layers. Complete delocalisation where layer thickness approaches the grain scale is expected as the typical shear bandwidth in granular media (10\u201320 grains) exceeds layer thickness. Successive fracture reactivation causes geometrical complexity in the form of splays and branches, and in addition the thickness-dependence of strain localisation governs fracture distribution in the layer. A second, temporal trend is recorded in the progressive embrittlement of the rocks as they cooled during exhumation, evidenced by increasing fracture density and a switch from shear to extensional fracturing. In the final stages, the marble was brittle enough to allow fracture propagation from the amphibolite across the material interface into the marble and, finally, the formation of brittle fractures affecting both the amphibolite and marble.\n               ","50":"\n                  Antitaxial fibrous veins are commonly developed in low permeability shale in orogenic belts and sedimentary basins. We review work on antitaxial fibrous veins, provide a classification, and discuss a formation mechanism. On the basis of crystal morphologies within veins, generalized fibrous veins can be categorized into stretched, syntaxial and antitaxial veins, and the antitaxial veins are fibrous veins in the strict sense. Typically, individual antitaxial fibrous veins consist of a median zone and two fibrous zones. According to detailed petrographic observations, four different types of solid inclusions within antitaxial fibrous veins were distinguished. Only solid inclusions occurring within blocky or elongate-blocky crystals in the median zone reliably indicate crack events. Other types of solid inclusions do not show clear evidence of crack-seal mechanism. The initial opening of antitaxial fibrous vein is considered to result from hydrofracturing caused by fluid overpressure. The origins of fluid overpressure mainly include hydrocarbon generation, tectonic compression and mineral transformation (such as illitization of smectite and hydration of anhydrite to gypsum), or a combination of these factors. The crack-seal mechanism cannot fully explain the formation mechanism of fibrous veins, and it may be only responsible for the median zone of antitaxial fibrous veins. The growth of fibrous crystals occurs at vein-wall interface without fracturing. Petrographic observations show that fluid pressure, force of crystallization, and sometimes tectonic compression synchronously drive fibre growth. The goal of further work should be to quantitatively determine fluid pressure and force of crystallization during fibre growth.\n               ","51":"\n                  The formation of the Ibero-Armorican Arc, a major structure in the SW Variscan orogeny, induced in most of its southern Iberian branch a heterogeneous sinistral transpressive regime. The presence of pre- and syn-orogenic steep planar anisotropies subparallel to the main WNW-ESE structural trend, gave rise to an important strain partitioning of the Variscan deformation. This lead to the lateral juxtaposition of narrow blocks where simple shear dominated transpression predominates, with wider ones where the pure shear to pure shear dominated transpression is pervasive. This partitioning of deformation is observed from the orogenic macroscale to the mesoscopic and even microscopic scales.\n                  The detailed structural mapping of the well exposed Lower Ordovician Armorican quartzites in one of the simple shear dominated sectors (the Mar\u00e3o Mountain in Northern Portugal), coupled with microstructural observations of chosen thin sections, emphasize the coeval development of WNW-ESE sinistral shear zones and subparallel folds. The interference between different Variscan structures, with particular geometries and kinematics, help to understand how transpressive regimes related to the major early oblique orogenic collisions could evolve to late intracontinental orthogonal collision.\n                  When the Variscan transpressive regime of Mar\u00e3o is interpreted in the context of the Iberian Variscides, it becomes clear that independent sectors of the same fold belt could compensate the orogenic shortening by different amounts of vertical thickening versus horizontal lateral escape. This explains why tectonic domains where the structures are related with a stretching subparallel to the a kinematic axis (X \u2261 a\n                     kin), could exist in the vicinity of domains where the stretching is subparallel to the b kinematic axis (X \u2261 b\n                     kin).\n               ","52":"\n                  Fault rocks in the brittle regime are often the result of large-displacement shearing. Traditional direct shear tests that perform small displacements can only study one episode of the whole faulting process. Ring shear apparatuses that can achieve large-displacement shearing are mostly used to study incohesive soil or friction granular materials. The objective of this paper is to study the brittle cataclastic process of fault rocks from the damage of intact rock to the frictional movement of the incohesive cataclastic rocks. A large-displacement direct shear model with a constant contact area of fault walls based on the particle-based discrete element method is proposed to simulate the structural evolution and mechanical behavior of dry brittle fault rocks. The results show that the crushing and rounding of irregular fragments are responsible for the reduction in the friction coefficient. The sharp fall is due to the crushing of rock fragments, while a moderate decline indicates grain rotation in the postpeak stress-displacement curve. This model helps to understand the cataclasis of brittle fault rocks.\n               ","53":"\n                  Pull-apart basins are structurally complex features that typically form in between two laterally offset strike-slip zones. The vast majority of analogue experiments on the formation of this type of basins have been conducted using basal discontinuities that transmitted from the bottom up strike-slip motion into the overlying sedimentary cover. Here, we present a series of models whose aim is to demonstrate that pull-apart basins above a viscous layer can be initiated not from the base up, but by the sole effect of lateral forces that allow two blocks to move laterally one past the other. This occurs independently from the basement, from which the brittle cover is fully decoupled by the viscous layer. This work was inspired by a natural example, the El Hamma Basin, located in Central Tunisia West of the city of Gabes and is bounded by two N100-110 trending major fault corridors, the Oum Ali- Fejij corridor in the North, and the Oglet Merteba-Matmata in the South. The area underwent multiple tectonic episodes of both extension and compression from Late Liassic to the Plio-Quaternary times. The region was subjected to regional NE-SW extension during the upper-cretaceous and major NW-SE compression during upper Miocene (Tortonian) and early quaternary (Early Pleistocene). The latter stage resulted in right-lateral strike slip along both corridors with faults forming a pull-apart basin that comprises two lateral mega-grabens separated by a central horst. Although one sub-circular diapir in the area (the El Melah diapir) crops out along the northern wrench zone, whether or not the mobile Triassic series extend farther South of it, beneath the pull-apart basin, is still debated.\n                  Through a series of analogue experiments using an innovative technique that generates two narrow, parallel strike-slip zones located within the sedimentary cover, rather than in the basement. Experimental results show remarkably similar geometry and evolution with those of the El Hamma basin. Moreover, from a regional perspective, our results suggest that the pinch out of the Triassic evaporites extends further South than previously thought and underlies at least part of the El Hamma basin.\n               ","54":"\n                  In this work we show how the model of monoclinic transpression\/transtension can be applied to obtain the relation between the kinematic vorticity number of the flow, the angle between the strikes of extension fractures and shear zone, and the extension value normal to the extension fractures. This relation is graphically shown in a diagram that can be used to estimate the kinematic vorticity number provided that the other geometric and deformational parameters can be measured. The method is checked against published analogue experiments and is applied to the cases of the Rinconada fault system (Central California) and the Torcal de Antequera massif (Spain), where it is possible to evaluate the feasibility and robustness of this procedure by comparing its predictions against the vorticity values previously obtained with independent methods.\n               ","55":"\n                  Ancient gneissic terranes are critical rare materials that can reveal the Earth's early crustal evolution.

The THF is a splay off the Tanlu fault zone and has been traced for 130\u00a0km and is 1\u20131.5\u00a0km wide. The THF has a 28\u00a0km sinistral offset, which has been established by detailed field observation. Restoring the 28\u00a0km offset, means that: (1) A sizeable potential area is recognized for searching for more 3.8\u20132.9\u00a0Ga Eo-Mesoarchean rocks; (2) A large NW-striking late Archean BIF belt is correlated with another at Anshan. Our data integrate with regional structural information of the Tanlu fault zone; we suggested that the Tanlu fault zone has an eastwards-fan splay pattern geometric feature in its northern part. Accordingly, we further restore the ancient tectonic configuration of eastern Asia before the Tanlu fault zone initiation. Eo-Mesoarchean rocks and 2.7\u20132.9\u00a0Ga terranes cropping out in Eastern Block of the North China Craton are arranged in line with NNW-SSE strike, which is consistent with their oriented gneissic foliations.\n               ","56":"\n                  A relationship between crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) and strain geometry (strain-ellipsoid shape) is often assumed, but not well documented. In this work, we use the EBSD method to study quartz CPO and microstructure in relation to strain geometry in a folded conglomerate in the SW Scandinavian Caledonides, where strain varies from strongly flattening (long limbs) to constrictional (hinges and inverted short limb). Our work shows that strain was accommodated by dynamic recrystallisation through subgrain rotation, bulging and Dauphine twinning. Differential stress during deformation is estimated at \u223c125\u00a0MPa from recrystallised grain size. Deformed and recrystallised grains show similar patterns of crystallographic orientation, despite a significant difference in grain size. We find no correlation between strain geometry and CPO, which we explain by means of a flow perturbation fold model. In this model, the variation in strain geometry is a result of progressive layer rotation during shearing. A correlation may be expected for steady-state deformations with no folding of layers with strain markers. However, flow perturbation may be a common cause of complex 3D strain patterns in sheared rocks. Hence, estimating strain geometry from CPO alone is inherently difficult and should be avoided unless a simple and steady deformation history can be assumed.\n               ","57":"\n                  Although sedimentary dykes have been widely reported across a range of settings, sedimentary sills have received somewhat less attention, perhaps due to the potential difficulties in identifying largely conformable intrusions within bedded sequences. Most outcrop descriptions of clastic intrusions are based on deep-water marine sequences, with few descriptions of sills in lacustrine settings. The recognition of sills in such settings is, however, important because lacustrine sequences are increasingly used as a record of palaeoseismic activity. The misidentification of sills that contain fragments and clasts of host stratigraphy with seismically-generated turbidites and debris flows, may lead to incorrect interpretations of palaeoseismicity. We use the Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation of the Dead Sea Basin as a case study, where laminated lake sediments preserve intricate relationships with sills. This permits us to not only establish a range of criteria used in the identification of sedimentary sills, but also examine relationships with adjacent seismically-triggered slumps and slides. Key criteria we use to recognise sills include marked changes in their thickness together with bifurcation and bridging geometries. Sills may be internally layered, contain lenses of breccia, together with aligned and folded clasts that may be truncated across upper sill contacts. Critical evidence for the interpretation of sills is also preserved along sharp but irregular upper contacts that erode and truncate bedding in the overlying host sequence. Minor apophyses and \u2018wedges\u2019 intrude both upwards and downwards from sills, while isoclinal recumbent \u2018peel-back\u2019 folds are created in host sediments by shear generated along the lower contacts of sills. We have undertaken anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis and find an oblate fabric that suggests flow and intrusion of sills along the strike of the slope, that may also help with their identification in bedded sequences. Sills form along detachments to both extensional and contractional deformation associated with seismically-generated slumps and mass transport deposits, together with sub-surface fold and thrust systems. High fluid pressures associated with injection of sedimentary sills may facilitate near-surface failure and downslope movement of the sedimentary pile.\n               ","58":"\n                  Computer-based numerical solutions of geomechanical problems are important to understand the processes forming rock structures as well as to quantify the associated pressure, stresses and strain rates.

Here, we present a simple computer program to calculate the stress, pressure, velocity and strain rate fields for two-dimensional (2D) viscous inclusion-matrix systems under pure shear and simple shear. The main aim of our contribution is to explain this computer program in a simple and transparent way, so that it can be used for introductory courses on geomechanical numerical modelling in structural geology. We present the governing equations of 2D viscous deformation and program the equations in the same order and style, so that the equations are still recognizable in the computer program. The computer program can treat stiff and weak inclusions of any shape and considers both linear and power-law viscous flow laws.

H2O-added samples showed \u223c30\u00a0MPa lower mean strengths than as-is samples. Samples weaken slightly after 15% strain with mean flow stresses in the range of 154\u2013227\u00a0MPa, and stress exponent (n) values between 1.45 and 2.13. The original quartz grains have been deformed plastically (dislocation glide). Discrete mode I cracks without detectable offset have developed in addition to plastic strain. Deformation was associated with recrystallization of up to 20% of the material in the most deformed parts of the samples. New grains were nucleated by both cracking and subgrain rotation, and were largely reconstituted by H2O-promoted grain boundary migration, related to dissolution-precipitation processes. This reconstitution of material is documented by a change in luminescence to blue, caused by trace elements exchange in quartz structure. The blue luminescence is prominent along healed cracks and high angle grain boundaries while it was not observed along the low angle boundaries formed by subgrain rotation. Compared to the as-is samples, the crack-related recrystallization is more frequent in the H2O-added samples. The low stress exponent values may indicate dissolution-precipitation and grain boundary sliding processes to accommodate incompatibilities at grain boundaries arising from an insufficient number of active slip systems. We suggest that the ubiquitous presence of H2O in nature may promote recrystallization of quartz by combinations of cracking, dislocation glide and creep and dissolution-precipitation processes.\n               ","60":"\n                  Basement fracture and fault patterns on passive continental margins control the onshore landscape and offshore distribution of sediment packages and fluid pathways.

(2) Epidote, chlorite and quartz fault mineralizations indicate a dominant strike-slip stress field in the Late Devonian to early Carboniferous. (3) E-W extensional stress fields which could be related to Permo-Triassic or Late Jurassic rifting are not prominent in our data set.

The Manchi pluton, located in the western Cameroon domain of the Pan-African Fold Belt of Central Africa in Cameroon, is made of hornblende-biotite granite (HBtG), biotite granite (BtG) and protomylonites of HBtG. The pluton intruded the high grade country rocks made of banded gneiss and amphibolites. AMS of the pluton is controlled dominantly by paramagnetic phases such as, Fe-bearing silicates (biotite and hornblende). This is inferred from the low Km values (<500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 SI units) as well as from hysteresis data. The AMS ellipsoid shape is mostly oblate, implying that flattening component of the strain was important during granite emplacement. Microstructural observations reveal presence of magmatic to sub-magmatic and solid-state deformation textures developed at moderate- to low-temperatures. This is consistent with the presence of rhomb <a> and basal <a> slip systems established from quartz c-axis data through EBSD analysis. The pluton recorded top-toward SW to top-toward south sense of shear as established by the kinematic markers. This indicates a component of simple shear during tectonic evolution of the pluton. We infer that the magnetic fabrics recorded in the Manchi granitic pluton is a manifestation of the D2 regional deformation.

We vary the initial orientation and rheology of the layers within pebbles, as well as the relative rheology of the conglomerate matrix, for single isolated pebbles and multiple interacting pebbles. We use a power-law viscous rheology for both the pebbles and their matrix. Folding within pebbles can indeed occur, but only within a narrow range of initial layer orientations, strength or viscosity ratio between the internal layers and that of the matrix relative to the pebble layers. Results are used to interpret the strongly deformed conglomerates from the Proterozoic Hutuo Group in the Wutai Mountains, North China Craton, that contain a small percentage of pebbles with internal folds.

The syntectonic fluids preserved in the fluid inclusions in the quartz veins are predominantly aqueous-carbonic saline with a minor amount of methane detected in Raman spectroscopy. FIs showing the variable and uniform degrees of fill were entrapped as the immiscible and miscible aqueous-carbonic fluids, respectively. Microthermometry on FIs implies a considerable fluctuation in fluid pressure during the evolution of the SATZ. The absolute paleostress magnitude, estimated by the 3-D Mohr circle reconstruction, substantiates fluctuation in the ambient stress, indicating the role of tectonic stress. The implosion and explosion textures in fluid inclusions, fluid pressure fluctuations, and tectonic stress fluctuations are attributed to multiple seismic events that occurred at a depth of 7\u201313\u00a0km during the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene (21\u201325\u00a0Ma).\n               ","64":"\n                  We studied the microstructural and textural modification of columnar calcite naturally deformed at increasing shear strain.

Both massifs are bounded by major wrench faults of opposite kinematics but comparable magnitude in their lateral displacement. Despite the volumes of research available, little has been said in the literature about the tectonics surrounding these particular systems. In this context, digital terrain elevation (DEM), regional geology, satellite imagery and geophysical data were analysed to illustrate how a network of transcurrent faults uplifted the peaks. We propose a model to account for topography by the opposed movement of faults operating in two compartments: internal (acute) and external (obtuse). Fault motion caused uplift of the internal compartments: a) the Santa Marta tectonic syntaxis is generated by the sinistral Santa Marta-Bucaramanga Fault on the west and the dextral Oca-Pilar Fault to the north whilst, b) the Famatina tectonic syntaxis is caused by the Valle F\u00e9rtil sinistral fault on the western side and the dextral Tucum\u00e1n lineament to the north. Elevation maps documenting the lateral displacement of modern alluvial fans provide evidence of the existence and kinematics of these faults. Active since the Neogene, the transcurrent faults resulted in displacements in the order of 25\u201360\u00a0km, with velocities of approximately 1\u20132\u00a0cm\/year. Seismic records suggest that the syntaxis occurred after reactivation of oblique discontinuities in the basement due to the convergence of the Nazca, Caribbean, and South American plates. This tectonic framework led to the formation of a remarkable positive relief and the development of internal positive compartments subject to constrictive forces. Simultaneously, external distensive and negative compartments controlled the syntectonic deposition of thick sedimentary sequences. The significant topographic difference between the internal positive compartments and their external negative counterparts triggered high rates of erosion, transport, and ultimately sedimentation. Regional subsurface surveys indicate strong anomalies of the underlying bedrock influenced by tectonic syntaxis.\n               ","67":"\n                  This paper tracks the role of plates in plate tectonics and mantle convection. Geometric and morphologic plate analyses are based on paleoreconstructions, beginning at 200\u00a0Ma, large-scale volcanic events, APWPs, and geoid data. Plates organize themselves to form a space-fitting geometry with a minimum perimeter\/area (P\/A) ratio (i.e., SA\/V in three-dimensions) and a coordination number close to 5. Plates are either broken and subducted in order to remove plates with high P\/A ratios or combined with other plates to reduce the total perimeter in the lithospheric plate mosaic. Various permutations of breaking and\/or combining of high P\/A plates are applied throughout earth's history to reduce the global P\/A ratio. During this process, plates change their shape and\/or size, which aids plate mobility to ultimately reach a stable geometry. Plates can only move with a suitable geometry and the global pattern keeps adjusting to reach a stable geometry. The lithospheric plates follow a pattern of \u2018punctuated steady state\u2019, where the global geometry cycles between \u2018ductile\u2019 periods, when the plates are moving to reach a new steady state geometry, to more static, or stable, periods, when the plates are relatively immobile and connected by a stable network of compressional stresses. Here, the B\u00e9nard-Marangoni theory is used to explain plate patterns in terms of surface tension because it allows for convection to be driven by temperature dependent surface tension. Mantle flow drives the temperature gradient at the surface, which results in a surface tension gradient. So, temperature dependent buoyancy and surface tension both play a role in convection. This suggests that there is feedback between the plates and the mantle, so neither is entirely passive.\n               ","68":"\n                  Natural beds at different stratigraphic levels display different degrees of folding.

Compared with previous trishear models, TMSP has the advantage that propagation-to-slip ratio can be updated with the proceeding of fault rupture propagation and is not required to be predetermined. A natural fault-propagation fold, Tejerina fold, can be reproduced well by TMSP. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to investigate the influences of three key parameters of TMSP, including apical angle, yield stress, and elastic modulus, on faulting process and folding growth.\n               ","69":"\n                  Magmatic and sub-solidus fabrics in intrusive rocks are frequently used to infer the relative timing of deformation with respect to magma emplacement and cooling. Here, we describe the relationships between strain and fabric development in leucogranite sheets (pegmatite, aplite) emplaced into shear zones that localized post-thermal peak deformation in the contact aureole of an upper crustal pluton (<0.2\u00a0GPa) on the Island of Elba, Italy. The leucogranite sheets present igneous, mylonitic, and cataclastic fabrics. Detailed meso- and microscopic structural analysis suggests that the dykes emplaced in the shear zones behaved as competent, rigid bodies during mylonitic deformation of the host rocks. Thermal modelling indicates that emplacement and cooling of the sheets occurred very rapidly (a few days to years) compared to typical tectonic strain rates and strain accumulation timescales in the host rocks. Such a fast cooling does not allow melt or magma-induced thermal softening in the host rocks during deformation. The development of mylonitic and cataclastic fabrics in the dykes was controlled by the localized activation of fluid-controlled reaction softening mechanisms (mylonitic fabric) and embrittlement during cooling in sites of high-strain (cataclastic fabric). We show that a broad spectrum of fabrics can form in igneous sheet intrusions emplaced at the same time and crustal level. The coexistence of isotropic (non-foliated igneous) versus anisotropic (mylonitic and cataclastic) fabrics in igneous sheet intrusions should therefore be evaluated in terms of tectonic strain rates, cooling rates, thermal state of the host, distribution of heterogeneous strain, and activation of strain softening mechanisms. Our observations highlight that the concepts of pre-, syn-, late- and post-tectonic fabrics in intrusive igneous rocks should be used with caution when interpreting relative timing relationships between deformation and magmatism.\n               ","70":"\n                  The composition and deformation patterns in the deep crust of southeastern Tibet are remain controversial. In this study, we present microstructures, fabric and seismic properties of amphibolites from the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone, western Yunnan, China. The amphibolites display a distinct mylonitic foliation, and the amphibole grains show low intracrystalline deformation, slight compositional zoning but strong crystallographic preferred orientations (CPOs). We explain these CPOs could have formed by rigid body rotation during deformation accommodated by diffusion creep and grain boundary sliding. The amphibolites show strong seismic anisotropies (AVp\u00a0=\u00a04.6\u20139.3% and Max. AVs\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u20139.0%). Rock recipe modelling results indicate the seismic anisotropies of the mylonitic amphibolites are dominated by the content of biotite and amphibole. The delay time (0.28\u20131.01\u00a0s, average of 0.58\u00a0s) calculated for a 40\u00a0km-thick amphibolite layer is consistent with the observed delay time (0.52\u00a0s) of Pms wave splitting in this region, which indicates a thick amphibolitic layer in the crust of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The observed Pms wave splitting, extensive fold deformation and low velocity zones (LVZs) in the Diancang Shan (DCS) massif indicate two anisotropic layers in the crust. The upper layer related to frozen fabrics of amphibolites, which deformed during compressional folding and strike-slip shear. The lower layer related to the alignment of amphibole and melt pocket induced by present-day channel flow. The observed Pms wave splitting in the Ailao Shan (ALS) massif is attributed to amphibolites with vertical foliation and horizontal lineation which are generated by compressional folding and strike-slip shearing.\n               ","71":"\n                  The mechanisms by which fluids modify the mineralogy and geochemistry of fault zones and the role of rock\u2013fluid interactions in fault weakening are subjects of debate. We assessed the mineralogical and geochemical variations in fault rocks in the Shaba area of the Yingxiu\u2013Beichuan surface rupture zone of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake using analyses of their mineralogical compositions, major elements, and the microstructural characteristics of wall rocks, damage zones, and oriented fault gouge samples from the principal slip zones. The elemental and mineralogical compositions show a certain regularity across the fault zone from the wall rocks to the fault gouge so that (1) Al2O3, Fe2O3\n                     T, and K2O contents increase and exhibit significant enrichments in the fault gouge; (2) Na2O and P2O5 contents decrease gradually and exhibit significant depletions in the fault gouge; (3) quartz, feldspar, and carbonate mineral contents decline; and (4) clay mineral contents increase dramatically. Isocon analysis indicates that mass losses in the Shaba fault zone occur with losses in the damage zone < the fault gouge. The mechanisms of material loss and transformation in the fault zone are complex, and mechanical fracturing, dehydration reactions, and fluid\u2013rock interactions are important factors in changing and controlling the material compositions and fault zone evolution, with material losses and transformation especially important within the fault core. Moreover, due to the damage zone having a higher permeability than the fault core, it was conducive to hydrothermal upwelling, fluid\u2013rock interactions, and fracture healing.\n               ","72":"\n                  Tectonic pseudotachylytes have provided valuable insights into the evolution of seismic activity during crustal deformation. However, the origin and formation processes of pseudotachylytes are still debated. Thin pseudotachylyte veins were first recognized within the granitic mylonites of the continental exhumed Ailaoshan-Red River strike-slip shear zone, southeastern Asia, which record the deformation characteristics from ductile (mylonite) to brittle deformation (ultracataclasite). Mylonitization resulted in the recrystallization of quartz aggregates\/ribbons, fine-grained plagioclase, and the concentration of biotite into biotite-rich foliation planes. The pseudotachylyte veins have various angles oblique to the host rock foliation, which record superimposition of the latter brittle deformation onto former ductile fabrics. Observations of the microstructure and quartz clast size distribution (obey power-law distribution) suggest that crushing was the dominant process in the formation of pseudotachylyte in the samples. Plagioclase within the pseudotachylyte vein presents a complex texture of high-strength nanocrystalline to partly amorphous material. Detailed microstructure observation revealed that amorphous materials form by a solid-state amorphization process and is different from friction melts. The changes in composition between plagioclase clasts and amorphous materials (enriched in Ca, but depleted in Na) provide evidence of mechanochemical effect that accompanies fault motion and comminution process. When a sufficient amount of amorphous material is formed, it has great significance in fault weakening through the coseismic slip of the strain partition.\n               ","73":"\n                  Quartz and columnar calcite microstructures in two major high-pressure (HP) shear zones (Syros Island, Greece), which carry meta-igneous rocks over calcite marbles, were studied to investigate the deformation conditions associated with their development and exhumation. Quartz-rich bands within the hanging-wall of the shear zones record the deformation during the operation of the shear zones under HP conditions at slightly decreasing temperatures (from 500\u00a0\u00b0C to 450\u00a0\u00b0C). At HP conditions, the shear zones are associated with (E)SE-directed shearing under plane strain conditions, as well as with a temporal increase in strain rate of one order of magnitude (from \u223c10\u221212 to \u223c10\u221211). Well-preserved columnar calcite within marbles of the footwall indicates that ductile shearing along the shear zones should have abruptly ceased during the early stages of exhumation, passing to a period of relative quiescence within the stability field of aragonite at temperatures \u223c430\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C. Progressive exhumation and cooling below 400\u00a0\u00b0C are associated with weak and distributed (E)NE-directed shearing with strain rate slower than \u223c10\u221214. Our results from north(east) Syros indicate a change in transport direction from (W)NW-(E)SE at the deep subduction levels to (W)SW-(E)NE during exhumation. This change is linked to a change in deformation, from localized to weak and distributed revealing that the Blueschist Unit in north(east) Syros was exhumed as a nearly rigid body.\n               ","74":"\n                  Predicting natural fracture networks is critical for unconventional hydrocarbon exploration, carbon capture\/storage, and geothermal energy projects.

Realistic geometries guide the evolutionary forward model based on kinematic algorithms derived from naturally deformed rocks, while the mechanisms and conditions dictating fracture attributes are modelled directly as a result of key geomechanical properties and underlying physical laws. Collectively this workflow aims to improve understanding of subsurface fracture distributions by representing the inferred strain history and relating this to fracture attributes; this may go some way to addressing any uncertainty regarding the deformation of key stratigraphic intervals and permit construction of more representative fracture network models.\n                  The techniques are applied to a real-world data set from the fractured hydrocarbon reservoirs of the Teapot Dome anticline in Wyoming, USA, and specifically a 2D seismic section through the culmination of the structure. The doubly-plunging, basement-cored anticline developed above a blind fault and is modelled as a fault-propagation\/trishear evolutionary forward model while tracking the state of strain.

The faults, which formed during the rift evolution, have proven to be crucial in controlling hydrocarbon accumulations and migration, not only as a pathway for fluid flow but as a factor controlling the deposition of sedimentary rocks. Thus, the topological analysis of fault networks is a key method to characterize the different fault sets, as it provides a way to describe the network arrangement of individual faults and their connectivity. In this work, the fault topology was analyzed in terms of nodes and branches for the main reservoir defined in the pre-salt section seismic units: Rift, Lower Barra Velha (Lower BVE), and Upper Barra Velha (Upper BVE). Four fault sets were characterized in these units with average orientations to NW-SE and E-W. The topology of this fault networks is characterized by single-phase rift network, featuring isolated systems with more than 50% of isolated branches and low connectivity (connections per branch being less than 0.5). The flow azimuth is NE-oriented, mostly oblique to the trend of the main faults, which suggests a low fault influence in the fluid flow. On the other hand, the paleotopographic highs developed during the Rift phase present the highest fault density and intensity, factors known to contribute to increased connectivity in reservoirs. A clear limitation of this type of study is the integration of the seismic-scale faults with high-frequency well log data, sparse but known to have great vertical resolution, and, in turn, assessing the vertical fluid flow, instead of lateral as is possible with this method. These limitations are to be known by one to apply this in other contexts. In this work, we seek to understand how the development of the rift fault system influences the generation of new fault sets, and fluid flow in a pre-salt carbonate reservoir.\n               ","76":"\n                  Integration of field structural data and 3D-photogeology from the southern part of the Rinkian Orogen, in central West Greenland, indicates that Paleoproterozoic marbles of the M\u00e2rmorilik Formation were deformed by two compressional events in the foreland of the orogen, associated with tectonic inversion of normal faults. Tectonic transport and folding post-date the Rinkian metamorphism (c. 1830\u20131800\u00a0Ma) with the first event characterized by NNE-SSW oriented compression and tectonic stacking of folded calcitic marbles (Black Angel Tectonic Unit), above slightly deformed dolomitic marbles (South Lakes Tectonic Unit). The second event caused the inversion of NE-SW trending normal faults during NW-SE oriented compression. Field observations reveal that the normal faults have a listric geometry and were inverted after c. 20\u00b0 tilting to the NE of the Maarmorilik carbonate platform. The style of tectonic inversion reflects the amount of extension accommodated along the listric faults showing rollover anticlines and extensional fault-bend-folds in the hanging wall, then inverted as thrust anticlines, back-thrusts antithetic to the normal fault or normal faults passively truncated by younger thrusts.

The modelling results show that extension parallel to the strike-slip margin of the indenter creates subsidence distributed in several areas which may connect to form a large sedimentary basin behind the indenter. This transtensional basin with v-shape geometry narrows gradually towards the strike-slip margin of the indenter. In contrast, models with extension perpendicular to the strike-slip margin distributes transtensional deformation away from the indenter. Our results are in good correlation with the evolution of the Carpatho-Balkanides orocline of South-Eastern Europe, where the Circum-Moesian Fault System accommodates oroclinal bending during indentation against the Moesian Platform. In this area, the modelling explains the coeval and contrasting extensional features observed along the strike-slip margin and behind the indenter (i.e. the Getic Depression and the Morava Valley Corridor), driven by the roll-back of the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs.\n               ","78":"\n                  Necking zones, located between the proximal and distal domains of passive margins, are characterized by important crustal thinning and the occurrence of extensional detachment faults.

The footwall of the fault consists of basement gneisses, while its hanging wall presents pre-to syn-rift deposits. A careful observation of the basement\/cover contact also reveals the presence of a strain gradient affecting the Variscan gneisses, which are progressively deformed to cataclasite and to black gouges at the top basement, and sealed by undeformed Jurassic syn-rift sandstones, the Gr\u00e8s Singuliers, which rework fault rock pebbles. Microscale observations also indicate fluid-assisted deformation, characterized by the total breakdown of feldspars and the coeval formation of white mica, leading to strain softening along the fault plane. The overall observations point toward a rift-related detachment fault responsible for the exhumation of the internal Mont-Blanc basement, an interpretation which challenges previous models of crustal exhumation in the External massifs of the Alps. Finally, the preservation of an undeformed syn-rift sedimentary cover sealing a tectonized top basement makes this area a fossil analogue for detachment faults in necking domains. It demonstrates that preservation of pre-Alpine, rift related structures is possible even in highly deformed areas, and emphasizes the role played by pre-Alpine inheritance on the building of the Alpine Mountain belt.\n               ","79":"\n                  This paper deals with a new example of spiral geometry in medium-grade metamorphic rocks.

Their long axes are oriented at angles of 40\u201390\u00b0 to mineral lineations, and are sub-parallel to the average orientation of curvilinear hinge lines of shear-related folds. The wrapping sense coincides with the sense determined by shear sense indicators and shear-related fold vergence. We conclude that the spiral pods developed during a single progressive non-coaxial deformation. Their development began with the formation of buckle microfolds and small shear-related tight to isoclinal folds with curvilinear hinge lines. Shear-related folds experienced refolding and subsequent disarticulating of their refolded hinges. The sense of rotation of hinge lines and rolling of hinges is consistent with the shear sense and these processes led to the formation of spiral pods at all stages of progressive non-coaxial deformation. Thus the spiral pods evolved from refolded folds with curvilinear hinge lines whereas spiral slump folds with a similar structure from cylindrical refolded folds.\n               ","80":"\n                  The present work showcases a comprehensive phase-field study on the formation of multi-crack-seal veins in quartz microstructures.

In a two grain system we exemplary show the formation of three different archetypes of radiators which are observed in natural quartz veins. We extend the phase-field studies to a polycrystalline host rock and investigate therein the effects of fracture aperture, presence of accessory minerals, and oblique opening trajectories with refracturing of fully and partially sealed veins on the occurring vein crystal morphology. Our results show that the shape of the forming grain boundaries depends on the crystal orientation of the participating grains, the location of a fracture through the crystals, and the sealing state. Evolution of more pronounced radiator structures are found in simulation studies with increasing aperture.

To do so, we analyze arkosic sandstones of the Antenor Navarro Formation in the Rio do Peixe Basin, NE Brazil. The characterization of deformation bands involved: 1) acquisition of aerial imagery using a drone; 2) conducting direct field-based structural analysis along one scanline (frequency of deformation bands\/m); and 3) collection of samples in the field to perform petrophysical (porosity and permeability) tests. After the characterization phase, we built a 2D geological model using the previously acquired parameters and performed a single-phase numerical flow simulation of water using finite element code.

Our structural analysis demonstrated that the deformation bands preferentially strike NE\u2013SW, with secondary E\u2013W\u2013 to N\u2013S\u2013orientations. Our petrophysical analysis showed that samples affected by deformation bands have lower porosity (by up to two orders of magnitude) and permeability (by up to four orders of magnitude) values than samples collected in the host rocks. The numerical fluid flow simulation allowed us to conclude that the deformation bands act as partial flow barriers where the hydraulic head can indicate the barrier effect intensity. Pressure drops between host rock regions separated by deformation bands reached values from 10 to 40%, depending on the fluid flow direction, especially for cases with a high contrast between the permeability values (three orders of magnitude) of the deformation bands and the host rock. The results of this study focus on the importance of contrasts in permeability measurements between deformation bands and host rocks, which could help to enhance understanding of the behavior of the deformation bands as partial fluid flow barriers, as well as their implications for hydraulic properties in deformed siliciclastic reservoirs.\n               ","84":"\n                  In the Cenozoic Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, the genetic relationships between regional deformation, volcanic activity, and epithermal mineralization are not fully established.

Syndeformational dehydration of antigorite at 100\u00a0MPa and 550\u2013650\u00a0\u00b0C produces slow stick-slip, and the slip velocity and shear stress drop generally decrease with increasing temperature. At 100\u00a0MPa and 650\u00a0\u00b0C, the slip velocity and shear stress drop of slow stick-slip gradually decrease, implying a trend toward stable sliding, which might be related to a continuous increase in fluid pressure induced by the accumulation of fluid over time in the process of antigorite dehydration. Our results indicate that dehydration makes the sample weaker but more stable and does not cause embrittlement; therefore, an intermediate-depth earthquake in a subduction zone may be triggered by brittle deformation in strong peridotite surrounding dehydrating antigorite. Similar to the antigorite fault gouge previously studied, intact antigorite can also induce slow stick-slip under partial antigorite dehydration, indicating that slow earthquakes could be triggered in the mantle wedge of a hot subduction zone.\n               ","86":"\n                  Calcite is a common mineral precipitated within upper crustal fault zones and associated fractures, forming veins, mineral cements and fault coatings.

Cooling and differential stress increased from D2early to D2late, indicating progressive exhumation following typical lithospheric strength profiles. Vorticity data highlight a pure shear component that can account for the up-section telescoping of the paleo-isotherms.

Coaxial and non-coaxial deformations are subsequently defined as the result of comparing the directions of the finite strain ellipsoid with those of the incremental strain ellipsoid. Both pairs of concepts can be considered at any stage of the deformation, but their variation along the progressive deformation can also be considered, allowing deformation paths to be established. The convenience of complementing the graphs that show deformation paths as a variation of the shape of the strain ellipsoid (ellipse in plane deformation), with graphs that illustrate the rotationality and non-coaxiality of the progressive deformation, is suggested. Finally, geologically relevant types of deformation paths are described, relating them to mechanisms involved in the development of structures generated by rock deformation.\n               ","89":"\n                  Combining very-high-spatial resolution (<1\u00a0m) and the ability to provide stereo-pairs for 3D topographic reconstructions, Pleiades satellites offer great potential for large-scale and high-resolution studies in geosciences. In parallel, research-dedicated Virtual Reality (VR) applications are emerging based on high-quality data. We examined the potential of a VR application derived from very-high-resolution Pleiades imagery to infer the orientation of individual flows from kilometers-thick lava piles in the eastern Afar rift area (Strato\u00efd Formation, Djibouti). Based on Pleiades Digital Elevation Models and orthoimages, we compared two approaches: i) a \u201cclassical\u201d method in \u201cMouse Mode\u201d and ii) a method using the VR application. Both methods provide similar results in facet orientation measurements over the studied transects. Nevertheless, VR enables operator immersion in a very realistic virtual environment combining aerial synoptic and ground-level views.

The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) contains numerous strike-slip faults and provides opportunities to decipher the relative movements among different components. Here, we report new data from the ENE-trending Yabrai dextral ductile shear zone in the Alxa region (NW China) of the southernmost CAOB. We performed field mapping, structural analysis, and muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar dating to constrain the geometries, kinematics and timing of the shear zone. The Yabrai shear zone crops out for more than 150\u00a0km, and the kinematic indicators from the outcrops, microstructures, and quartz c-axis fabrics suggest a consistent dextral shear motion. The microstructures and EBSD results indicate intermediate-to low-temperature deformation (\u223c300\u2013530\u00a0\u00b0C). Muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar dating from mylonitic samples yield ages of 254\u2013251\u00a0Ma, which imply that the shear zone was active in the Late Permian. The displacement of Yabrai shear zone is estimated to be ca. 30\u00a0km. An integration of spatiotemporal patterns of shear zones and regional aeromagnetic data suggests that a giant \u201cS\u2013C\u201d-type shear system occurred in the Alxa region in the Late Permian. Based on this work and previous studies, a crustal-scale strike-slip system of late Paleozoic is developed between the CAOB and the southern cratons. It formed in a transcurrent regime after the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, which was a response to the deformation of the whole CAOB in the end of late Paleozoic.\n               ","91":"\n                  The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian (Brasiliano) intracontinental Patos-Pernambuco shear system is developed in Archean to Neoproterozoic crust, reactivating rift margins N of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. We here use enhanced aeromagnetic images to reveal internal details of the broad E-W dextral Patos and Pernambuco shear zones, the intervening Central (Transversal) Domain and the adjacent Northern Domain. We estimate shear strains up to 50\u201360 and a total of ca. 350 and 200\u00a0km dextral displacement for the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones, respectively. Deflection of foliations, fold axial surfaces and plutons as well as internal S-C fabrics and asymmetric folds within these large shear zones confirm dextral displacement. However, the dominant population of NE-trending shear zones in the Central Domain, by many considered dextral, are here confirmed to be sinistral and thereby elongating this domain. The Northern Domain behaved differently, hence large-scale Ediacaran strain partitioning in the region is suggested, where different blocks experienced different deformation between major simple-shear dominated shear zones. We show how much more structural information can now be obtained from enhanced aeromagnetic data than from field mapping alone; aeromagnetic interpretations, nevertheless, still draw on analysis techniques epitomized by John Ramsay.\n               ","92":"\n                  A series of scaled analogue models were used to a preliminary study on the influence of the basal detachment configuration on the evolution of extensional systems, developed above an inclined basal ductile detachment. Three different basal configurations were aimed to test extension above: i) a homogeneously distributed ductile detachment; ii) two sectors with a different distribution of the ductile detachment, separated by an abrupt, transversal boundary; ii) a laterally variable width of the ductile detachment, driven by an abrupt oblique boundary. Fault activity was monitored through a series of digital elevation models obtained from the laser scanning of the models' surface. Results of the models analysis show how the geometry, the distribution, the kinematic, and the timing of faulting is strongly controlled by the geometry and orientation of the ductile-brittle interface in respect to the extension direction. Faults close to the brittle-ductile interface develop following the interface geometry, whose effect is reduced moving away from it. In addition, we observe a major number of faults which accommodates lower amount of extension and are less closely spaced above longer ductile detachments. Our results can be compared with natural case-histories along continental passive margins, where extension occurs above a dipping salt detachment, with inhomogeneous distribution (e.g., the northern Gulf of Mexico, central Brazilian margin, Angola margin).\n               ","93":"\n                  Deformation processes and rheological changes within the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) played a key role in accommodating exhumation of the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS). We present a study for the STDS in Zherger La, Yadong region, east-central Himalaya, to better quantify the spatial and temporal variations of the shear zone's internal deformation and rheology properties. Quartz microstructures and crystallographic preferred orientations, together with quantitative estimates of deformation temperatures, differential stresses, strain rates and viscosities are deduced from the ductile segment of the detachment zone. The mylonites that comprise the exposed shear zone preserve a range of deformation conditions that are interpreted in terms of progressive exhumation. Strain localization within the STDS is indicated by the microstructural evolution from penetrative deformation of constitutive minerals to localized deformation into quartz, which exhibit interconnected networks and high strain zones. Deformation temperatures decrease from 510\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040 to 405\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C and differential stresses increase from 24 to 100\u00a0MPa structurally upwards, as indicated by two-feldspar thermometry and quartz paleopiezometry, respectively. Strain rates derived from quartz dislocation creep flow law are on the order of 10\u221212-10\u221213 s\u22121 and are broadly consistent with macrostructurally-derived strain rates of 1.8\u20135.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 s\u22121, which are calculated from previously determined exhumation rates and shear zone width. The estimated differential stresses and strain rates are further utilized to determine the variation of viscosities across the STDS. The viscosities within the STDS range at 1019\u20131020\u00a0Pa\u00a0s. In conjunction with the published numerical modelling and analog modeling studies, the estimated viscosity data are compatible with the channel flow model for exhumation.\n               ","94":"\n                  In this study, we examine the errors and uncertainties associated with orientation measurements collected from digital outcrop models using the geometrical property, collinearity.

We, thus, demonstrate this relationship, as well as assess the impact any associated errors have on orientation distribution forms using orientation measurement traces collected from sandstone intrusions with a digital outcrop model of the Panoche Giant Injection Complex acquired through light detection and ranging and photogrammetry techniques.\n                  Our experiments highlight how in addition to sampling bias and sample size, unreliable orientation estimates can negatively affect interpretation. We show that the distribution of orientation for a network of geological structures (e.g., fractures, sandstone intrusions) in a particular region can be altered with the inclusion of erroneous measurements. From our case study, it was noted that the high proportion of unreliable orientation measurements obtained when using a digital outcrop model of the study area resulted in inconsistencies in the structural analysis that could have been attributed to other factors. Thus, without putting into consideration the reliability of the samples, a sampling issue will still be faced, regardless of using the appropriate sample size and technique.\n               ","95":"\n                  Several parameters steer the modes of shortening of carbonate-dominated fold-and-thrust belts from incipient- (layer parallel shortening, buckle folds) to evolved deformation stages (verging folds, discrete thrusts). In this study, we address the spatial and temporal evolution of contractional structures within carbonate-dominated fold-and-thrust belts by documenting the geometry, kinematics and structural architecture of the San Donato-Costa Thrust Zone, a splay of the regional Belluno Thrust of the seismically active Eastern Southern Alps (Northern Italy). Deformation is there accommodated by a variety of features ranging from open and upright to tight and verging folds cut by later thrusts. An integrated structural analysis indicates inherited primary features to have effectively steered the deformation style of the thrust and its immediate hanging wall and footwall. We propose an evolving deformation scenario initially governed by the inherited lithological features and localised pressure solution, then by the geometry of folds accommodating progressive shortening and, finally, by thrusting. The folding-faulting transition occurs when fold forelimbs dip \u223c80\u00b0 and the ratio between the dip angle of fore- and back limbs becomes \u223c3.3.

These models correspond to contractional folds and faults of Palaeozoic age, and to Mesozoic extensional structures affected by Cenozoic tectonic inversion in the form of folds and thrusts. The digital techniques and data employed are fieldwork, as well as Google Earth images, orthophotographs, stereoscopical pairs of photographs and virtual outcrop models, constructed using Structure from Motion photogrammetry based on images extracted from Google Earth or from photographs taken in the field using a tripod or unmanned aerial vehicles. The analysis of these models has provided us with geological information that would have been difficult to obtain using traditional techniques.

We investigated the structural record of an outlier of Archean to Paleoproterozoic supracrustal rocks (the Zwartkops Hills Outlier, ZHO) overlying the JD to investigate its tectonic evolution. Steep gneissic fabrics in the basement pre-date the intrusion of \u223c 3225\u00a0Ma trondhjemite (new U\u2013Pb zircon age). Two Archean deformation events affected West Rand Group rocks and pre-date Platberg Group deposition. To the south of the ZHO, a newly recognized, large-scale, recumbent fold formed during top-to-the-south shearing. In the central part of the ZHO, steeply W-dipping stratification results from E-W shortening. Two more deformation events are Paleoproterozoic in age and affected all units. A shallowly S-SW-dipping cleavage formed in the biotite zone of the greenschist facies is associated with N\u2013S shortening and top-to-the-north shearing. The cleavage transects the large recumbent fold and is observed down to the upper 30\u00a0m of the basement. Finally, a weak N\u2013S shortening event is inferred from kink folds and north-dipping axial planar cleavage. These data are consistent with the existing regional models of (i) south- and east-directed fold-and-thrust belts formed during sedimentation of the Archean Central Rand Group, (ii) north-verging schist belt formed during, or after the Transvaal Supergroup deposition, and (iii) impingement of the Bushveld Complex onto the JD during N\u2013S shortening. These findings are integrated with previous regional sedimentological, seismic, and structural studies to suggest that the JD granitoid basement formed a paleo-high during the deposition of the Central Rand and Platberg groups. Once buried in the upper crust, the paleo-high acted as a rigid granitoid promontory that indented weak surrounding cover rocks during Paleoproterozoic N\u2013S contraction events, creating the dome shape of the Johannesburg Dome.\n               ","98":"\n                  Bimaterial faults can be found in nonhomogeneous rock media between dissimilar rock layers. An analytical model was extended for the right lateral strike-slip fault between two dissimilar rock layers to predict the activated tensile, right and left lateral shear zones around the fault tip. The effect of elastic modulus contrast (E2\/E1, the ratio of the Young's moduli of the lower to the upper layer), rupture velocity (c), precompression stress ratio (-\u03edxx\n                     o\/-\u03edyy\n                     o), residual to peak strength ratio (\u03c4r\/rp) and fracture energy (G) were considered. Results show that under an intermediate rupture speed of (0.5 of the Rayleigh wave speed): the extension of activated tensile and shear zones depends strongly on the ratio of E2\/E1 and it increases with increasing this ratio. The preferred direction of the new branches is little affected by the elastic modulus contrast. Increasing precompression stress ratio encourages right and left lateral shear branching on the compressional side of the fault and decreases the size of activated tensile and shear zones. Under an extreme rupture speed of (0.98 of the Rayleigh wave speed): the mechanism of branching differs, for E2\/E1\u00a0<\u00a01, the three activated zones are located in the lower layer and there is only a possibility for unilateral branching on the extensional side of the fault. For E2\/E1\u00a0\u2265\u00a01, right and left lateral shear zones extend to the upper layer (compressional side), which means the possibility of bilateral shear branching on the two sides of the fault.

The results showed that the displacement required to reach the peak friction increased with the specimen size, while the shearing stiffness showed an opposite trend. A slight increasing tendency of peak friction with increasing specimen size was also observed, but it needs further testing to be assertive. The weakening behavior in the gouge layer increased at larger normal stresses leading to significant post-peak softening, which was intensified as the gouge layer size increased. Application of pre-consolidation to the gouge layer intensified the weakening behavior. The degree of non-linearity in the stress-displacement curves and rigidity of the specimens were also quantified, and a hyperbolic-type model was implemented to measure the shear stress mobilization rate based on the stress-displacement curves.

The fault SB5 evolution model was recovered using the fault pattern analyses and palaeostress reconstruction, which required factors like the width of the damage zone, maximum throw of the main fault, vertical separation, and the shear crack angle along the fault zone. The results show that: (1) Four tectonic layers in the vertical direction are identified according to the difference of structure style, divided by the top and bottom of the Cambrian salt rocks, and the top surface of the Ordovician carbonate. (2) Strike-slip faults in the study area are the middle segment of the large strike-slip fault zone composed of major faults and overlap zones; 11 stepovers in the study area can be classified into three types according to their geometric characteristics. Strain concentration appears on the overlap zone under the continuous shear stress field and shows high activity.

The fracture network geometry was generated with a discrete fracture network algorithm, in which the permeability and porosity of the system can be calculated if the aperture of the fractures is known. The hydrological aperture of the fractures was estimated via an aperture calibration based on a comparison of the measured and modelled permeability values. Flow zone indices were calculated for numerous sections along the well, designating hydraulic units, in which the fluid flow-controlling properties are internally even.\n                  Based on the fracture network geometry and the hydraulic flow units, most parts of the well behave uniformly, while three narrow zones differ significantly. The first zone is located in the upper 100\u00a0m of the well probably formed due to weathering. The second zone is located at approximately 400\u00a0m, where a large-scale structural boundary is presumed.

This may also relate to the objective difficulty of collecting very large datasets from single linear scanlines directly in the field, because of limited exposures. To overcome such a limitation, we selected a spectacular outcrop of the Miocene Marnoso-Arenacea Formation turbidite sandstones located near the Coniale village, in the Northern Apennines (Italy), where a vertical cliff provides a 100% continuous outcrop about 90\u00a0m high and 280\u00a0m long, with well-accessible exposures at its base, along the Santerno River. This setting allows combining data acquisition on a photogrammetric DOM (digital outcrop model) covering a representative sector of the outcrop, with ground truthing by direct measurements in the field. More than 2000 joints were identified in 9 linear scanlines traced in the DOM along mechanical layers with different thickness. Comparison with field data indicates that both joint orientation and spacing data from the DOM are very reliable. The scanlines include between 549 and 37 joints, depending on layer thickness, allowing to perform robust statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K\u2013S), Cramer-von Mises (CvM) and Anderson-Darling (A-D) nonparametric tests were used to identify the probability density function(s) that best fit spacing data among exponential, Gamma, log-normal and normal distributions. The Gamma distribution turned out as the most probable in most cases. In some specific sectors along all scanlines, joint density is significantly greater than the average for the presence of joint clusters. In some cases, joint clusters are vertically aligned with those in underlying and\/or overlying scanlines, thus resulting in thoroughgoing joint corridors. Comparison of spacing statistics inside and outside joint corridors\/clusters indicates a typical transition from Gamma distributions outside joint corridors\/clusters, to log-normal distributions inside them. The presence of joint clusters and corridors, as well as FSR, mode\/mean ratio, JSR, and FSI values, suggests that diffuse jointing in the sandstone layers of the turbiditic succession reached the saturation stage before a normal probability density function was produced, and then further strain was accommodated by localized deformation in clusters and corridors.\n               ","103":"\n                  Inherited and syn-compressional salt-controlled structures in orogens are difficult to distinguish from compressional features because classical salt features (halokinetic growth strata, salt welds) can be misinterpreted as shortening-related structures (syn-kinematic growth strata, tectonic unconformities). In the Sivas basin in Turkey, syn-kinematic salt diapirism entirely shaped the architecture of the foreland and allowed the development of primary and secondary minibasins. One of the most impressive, the Tuzlag\u00f6z\u00fc minibasin, formed by sinking into a salt feeder while being upturned due to compression. This minibasin has been nicknamed the \u201cTurkish V\u00e9lodrome\u201d because of its similarity with the well-known V\u00e9lodrome structure in the French Alps which shows growth strata and successive unconformities, commonly interpreted as foreland growth syncline features. Based on structural field descriptions and geometric analogies with the Tuzlag\u00f6z\u00fc minibasin, we revisit the V\u00e9lodrome as a salt-related minibasin. We argue that the V\u00e9lodrome developed as a secondary minibasin above an Oligocene aerial salt glacier: sheet of Upper Triassic evaporites extruded during Alpine orogeny. This new interpretation enables to propose a revised evolution of the sub-Alpine fold-and-thrust belt.

The exceedingly fast cooling rates indicate the operation of transient and proximal thermo-mechanical processes consistent with the contribution of thrust-related viscous heating during metamorphism.

In Activity 2, students take direct fracture measurements from the VOM and interpret various fracture characteristics. Their measurements are then compared to other fracture characterizations in the literature. Through the activities students are introduced to a number of key concepts in geology, including the importance of \u201cthinking in 3D\u2033, data collection, interpreting stereonets, and placing results in the context of previous work.\n               ","109":"\n                  Kink bands are common in rocks with a strong planar mechanical anisotropy, being generally developed in polydeformed areas during the late stages of deformation, in brittle to brittle-ductile conditions. In the Late Variscan deformation events in the Iberian Massif, several kink band structures were developed in association to the NNE-SSW sinistral strike-slip faults, which are induced by the Laurentia and Gondwana E-W dextral collision on Carboniferous times. Within two metric-scale kink bands, several 2nd order structures are generated in response to internal shortening during layering rotation. The present paper describes the internal geometry and kinematics of these type III fixed hinges kinks bands, discussing their deformation mechanisms. In order to quantify the internal shortening within kink bands, a new graphical method, using simple angular parameters, is proposed. This graphical approach applied to the studied kink bands allows their internal shortening to be quantified; it ranges between 12 and 18%. The genesis of 2nd order structures within kink bands results from the accommodation of the internal layer distortion during kink bands progressive deformation and is controlled by two main deformation processes: layer parallel shortening and layer parallel slip.\n               ","110":"\n                  We studied three samples of Banded Iron Formation (BIF) rocks from Southern Granulite Terrane (SGT) of India, which was metamorphosed at high-pressure granulite facies and exhumed from 40 to 50\u00a0km depth. We examined the microstructure, texture, and deformation mechanisms of the primary minerals (quartz, magnetite, and hematite). Microstructures, variations in size and shape of quartz grains suggest that the three samples deformed to different intensities and temperatures. The EBSD derived CPOs for quartz and magnetite grains are strong, implying dislocation creep as the dominant mechanism. The presence of distinct subgrains in magnetite, rare in natural samples, attests to the same. Furthermore, twinning on {111}, as evident from the misorientation angle and axis distributions, indicates ductile deformation of magnetite below 400\u00a0\u00b0C. Subgrain boundary trace analysis in selected magnetite grains reveals that multiple-slip planes {111}, {110}, and {100} were operational. Topotaxial replacement, via redox reaction, of magnetite grains along their octahedral planes by hematite is evident. Well-developed CPOs but low (<1\u00b0) GOS values of both magnetite and hematite grains suggest that recovery processes in these were rapid. Post-replacement deformation was weak and did not affect the hematite CPOs that were inherited from the relatively more deformed host magnetite grains.\n               ","111":"\n                  The Pyrenean domain records the development of a hyperextended system during the Early Cretaceous at Iberia\/Eurasia plate-boundary. This rifting stage is controlled by the coeval development of N120\u00b0 longitudinal and N20\u00b0 transverse tectonic features. In the west-Pyrenean Maul\u00e9on basin, preserved in the heart of a N120\u00b0 lithospheric pop-up, the Iholdy, Saison and Barlan\u00e8s transverse structures are known to play a significant role during the Cretaceous hyperextension. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining Raman thermometry, paleostress reconstructions, seismic interpretations, 3D implicit geological modeling and passive seismic interpretation, we define these three N20\u00b0 structures as syn-collisional transfer zones rooting at depth in the upper lithospheric mantle. These tectonic features significantly control the 3D structural architecture of the Maul\u00e9on basin pop-up. Indeed, the N120\u00b0-oriented thrust systems, defining the edges of the Maul\u00e9on basin pop-up, branch into these transfer zones and define corridors with differing amounts of shortening. This overall structural pattern defines drawer-like structures allowing the closure, by stages, of the former rift domain. Thus, this study clarifies the role of inherited lithospheric transfer zones in the reactivation of a hyperextended rift basin and bears upon the origin of the non-cylindrical shape of the West-Pyrenean belt.\n               ","112":"\n                  The successive indentation of India into Eurasia generated the orthogonal collisional E\u2013W Himalaya\u2013Tibet and the oblique collisional N\u2013S SE Tibetan Plateau along the frontal and eastern edges of the indenter, respectively. An understanding of the complete crustal deformation history of both regions is needed to reconstruct the processes involved in this indentation. Geological mapping and structural analysis of the transitional zone between these collisional belts reveal two stages of structures with different geometries. The earlier of these stages involves structures with an unusual structural association consisting of en \u00e9chelon aligned overturned dome-and-thrust pairs within a background of open folding, most likely representing the early development of a fold-and-thrust system. The later structures consist of an association of N\u2013S-trending thrust-and-tear-faults and open folds. Combining stratigraphic data from this region with the results of previous research indicates that the earlier structures formed at 60\u221248\u00a0Ma, whereas the later structures formed between the early Miocene and ca. 5 Ma. This information combined with geological and paleomagnetic data for the region allows reconstruction of the complete crustal deformation history of the oblique collisional belt, which consists of early and late stages of crustal shortening separated by a middle stage involving the \u223c80\u00b0 clockwise rotation of the crust. The spatiotemporally variable crustal deformation of the oblique collision belt combined with the long-lived N\u2013S crustal shortening of the orthogonal belt outline a consistent tectonic scenario within a single geodynamic system that enables the reconstruction of the indentation of India into Eurasia.\n               ","113":"\n                  Field observations and structural analysis of a 50-m-wavelength gentle anticline document bed-parallel fibrous gypsum veins (\u201cbeef\u201d) and calcite veins associated with contractional folding in the Boquillas Formation, east of Langtry, west Texas. Gypsum beef veins with bed-perpendicular fibers accommodated vertical extension of 13% in the anticline, diminishing to 0% in adjacent synclines. Bed-parallel calcite veins accommodated 0\u20134% vertical extension across the structure, with no clear correspondence of vein distribution to structural position. Homogenization temperatures from two-phase fluid inclusions in calcite veins indicate trapping depths of 2.0\u20132.7\u00a0km. Source rock analysis from unoxidized organic-rich mudrock at the site shows that the rocks never reached hydrocarbon maturation conditions, therefore vein formation cannot be explained by in situ hydrocarbon expulsion. Bed-parallel veins with vertical or bed-perpendicular fibers document a thrust faulting stress regime during contractional folding near the frontal limit of Laramide deformation. Gypsum vein formation may be related to meteoric water interacting with pyrite or H2S to form sulfuric acid, dissolution of carbonate, and deposition of gypsum as an auxiliary mineral. Switching between calcite and gypsum mineralization suggests opening and closing of fault and fracture controlled fluid pathways during deformation.\n               ","114":"\n                  The concept of fractal spatial distributions of mineralisation has been widely proposed since Mandelbrot (1965) who emphasised the stable Pareto-L\u00e9vy distribution as the relevant distribution. The concept of a fractal is used as a basis for estimating endowment and for erecting exploration models based on self-organised criticality. This paper explores the proposition that the growth kinetics for a mineralising system are reflected in the probability distributions that describe the spatial patterns of mineralisation. We revisit the data sets and ask the question: What are the best fit probability distributions for the spatial distribution of mineralisation? The answer is: members of the Extreme Value Distribution family (Gumbel-, Fr\u00e9chet- and Weibull-distributions) and not the Pareto distribution. Thus, the spatial distribution of mineralisation is not a fractal although the tails of the distributions can be or resemble power-laws. The standard box counting procedure for a spatial point distribution establishes a nearest neighbour distribution and hence, by definition, the resulting distribution is Weibull and not Pareto. The mass distributions are Fr\u00e9chet and not Pareto. The extreme end members are Gumbel. We discuss the implications of these distributions for models that generate mineralisation sites within a system and for the underlying thermodynamics.\n               ","115":"\n                  Blind active faults may lead to earthquake, therefore their identification and characterization constitute an important structural exercise. Such faults can be mapped by high-resolution shallow subsurface geophysical techniques, which offer meter-scale sub-seismic images. The Kachchh Rift Basin (KRB), situated on the western continental edge of the Indian plate, is tectonically active. The KRB is affected by the reactivation of \u223cW-striking dip-slip\/strike-slip faults. The Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) is the largest intra-basinal fault in KRB. The long-term terrain rejuvenation presumably masks the surface expression of the KMF. Shallow subsurface geophysical investigations, assisted by mesoscale structural observations were performed along the western part of the KMF.\n                  A ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was used to decipher the sub-seismic position and geometry of KMF. The KMF is inferred to be a near-vertical north-dipping normal fault. GPR data reveal potential colluvial wedges, faulted alluvial and colluvial Quaternary deposits, small-scale horst-graben and off-fault folding, which are not at all apparent in surficial observations and satellite imageries. A sequential evolution of colluvial wedges is explained attributed to KMF reactivation during Cenozoic.

The Ramba dome core comprises gneiss and two-mica granite, mantled mainly by schist sequences, and the degree of deformation decreases outward from pervasive mylonitization to weak mylonitization. Pre-doming deformation is characterized by the formation of regional-scale top-to-the-north shearing (D1) in the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence, locally preserved strong folding (F1), and intrusion of 46.3\u00a0Ma-40.6\u00a0Ma leucogranite. The D2 deformation consists of map-scale ductile shearing fabrics and top-to-the-north detachment along the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) in the middle and lower units of the dome. Intrusion of 26.1\u201321.0\u00a0Ma syn-kinematic leucogranite veins in the schist units occurred during the D2 north-directed extensional episode.

To better understand how megasplay faults affect earthquake rupture and associated tsunami potential, we use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to model the upper plate as a wedge that is partitioned into a seismic (velocity-weakening, VW) inner wedge and an aseismic outer (velocity-strengthening, VS) wedge, combined with a splay fault rooting at the decollement. We examine the effects of the width of the outer (VS) wedge, as well as the dip and friction along the splay fault during earthquake rupture. Our results suggest that along-strike variations in the width of the VS outer wedge along the Chile Margin may play a key role in splay fault activity in the ruptured segment of the 2010 Maule earthquake. In addition, our model fit to the published slip distribution for the 2010 Maule earthquake suggests that megasplay fault activation did not significantly impact earthquake size along the south-central Chile Margin. In contrast, our model fit to the slip distribution for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake shows that megasplay fault reactivation may have moderately affected earthquake coseismic rupture. Splay faults can slip coseismically, contributing to associated tsunamis. However, the presence of a VS outer wedge is the predominant constraint on rupture size and tsunami generation.\n               ","118":"\n                  This work presents novel multiscale spatial data analytics using Ripley's K-function, as a measure of spatial interaction, to study one-dimensional arrangement of fractures.

We investigate the relationship between the migration of C\u2013O\u2013H-rich melts and deformation mechanisms in large-scale ultramafic structural systems in the mantle and lower crust. The uniquely well-preserved field exposures and samples presented in this study were formed at ca. 1\u00a0GPa and allow us to investigate the relationship between deformation and volatile-melt emplacement in continental rifts at a rare level of detail. Through this study we demonstrate the influence of volatile-rich fluids on strain localization and deformation in the lower crust.\nMost studies of continental rifts near the crust-mantle boundary highlight rift structures and processes using geodynamic modelling (Ziegler, 1992) and\/or geophysical investigations (Zwaan and Schreurs, 2020). Physical models of intracontinental rifts account for the large-scale structures observed along rift transects, including structures related to lithospheric thinning and block faulting (Mckenzie, 1978) and transtensional structures in 3D-space (Brune et al. (2018) and references therein). However, due to the extreme exhumation required to expose the lower crust, few field studies of the deep sections of rifts exist as original geological features are obliterated by deformation and metamorphism.\nResearchers have long recognized the presence of mantle-derived C\u2013O\u2013H fluids in rifts (Irwin and Barnes, 1980). Fluid migration along crustal-scale structures brings mantle-derived fluids up to the Earth's surface (Pili et al., 1999), as documented through surface CO2-outgassing (Lee et al., 2016). The upwards migration of deeply derived fluids is highly dependent on the interaction of rock, magma, and fluids during deformation in the lower crust. C\u2013O\u2013H fluids also play an important role in the formation of mid to upper crustal resources, as deep fluid signatures are found in hydrocarbon reservoirs (Finlay et al., 2010; Fetter et al., 2019) and in Mississippi valley type (MVT) and sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) ore deposits (Blundell et al., 2003; Schmidt Mumm and Wolfgramm, 2004). Other authors have documented a link between magmatism, fluids, and seismicity at depth of 30\u201340\u00a0km (Lee et al., 2016; Roecker et al., 2017; Weinstein et al., 2017), indicating a link between fluids and seismic activity in continental rift settings. Recently, La Rosa et al. (2021) suggested a link between magmatic or other CO2-rich fluids and fluid-induced lower crustal earthquakes in the Afar rift.\nC\u2013O\u2013H fluids may help drive deformation along migration pathways (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019), but relatively little is known about the effects of such fluids in the mantle and lower crust. CO2 both embrittles olivine (Rovetta et al., 1986) and reacts with ultramafic rocks, forming carbonates (Wyllie et al., 1983) and causing volume expanding mineral reactions (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). These reactions weaken rocks, leading to strain localization, increased strain rates and\/or stress release through brittle failure and earthquakes (Campbell et al., 2020). Lower crustal seismicity occurs at similar depths to those where alkaline magma exsolves CO2 (Pan et al., 1991; Gerlach et al., 2002). These coinciding depths could indicate a link between magmatic CO2-bearing fluids and some deformation at certain crustal levels (Wilshire and Kirby, 1989).\nA large body of research is dedicated to understanding deformation mechanisms in the mantle and lower crust, particularly in peridotite rocks. The samples collected during this study exhibit a spectacular interplay between ductile and brittle deformation in ultramafic and mafic mineral assemblages. Olivine type fabrics pertaining to specific geodynamic and environments were described by Ismail and Mainprice (1998). Individual type fabrics can also be related to the activation of specific slip systems in olivine (Zhang and Karato, 1995), revealing deformation mechanisms at the smallest scales. More recent experimental work investigates strain localization and grain boundary sliding in olivine (Hansen et al., 2011, 2012), the findings of which we attempt to extrapolate to our own natural samples where intense strain localization occurred. Finally, studies investigating deformation during transient differential stress (Druiventak et al., 2012; Matysiak and Trepmann, 2012, 2015) shed light on the varying deformation mechanisms activated in olivine during lower crustal earthquake cycles and are compared to the findings of this study.\nOur observations include mutually overprinting olivine ultramylonites and pseudotachylytes, all formed in the lower crust. Pseudotachylytes, more commonly associated with shallow crustal levels, form as a melt product of frictional heating (Mckenzie and Brune, 1972). Numerous studies document brittle deformation and pseudotachylytes in the lower crust (Hawemann et al. (2018) and references therein). Mutual overprinting relationships between pseudotachylytes and ultramylonites indicate that these structures may form at similar boundary conditions (Sibson, 1980; Papa et al., 2020). Unfortunately, pseudotachylytes formed in the lower crust are prone to recrystallization, alteration, and crystal plastic deformation, making their certain identification difficult (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013). However, numerous observations including vein geometry, the presence of anomalously high-temperature phases, dispersed sulfide droplets, flow textures and the presence of preserved clasts may be used to identify relic pseudotachylytes (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013). Despite a large body of work documenting both ultramylonites and pseudotachylytes in the lower crust, the mechanisms driving deformation at depth remain enigmatic.\nMany potential driving mechanisms behind lower crustal and mantle deformation have been proposed, including self-localizing thermal runaway (Braeck and Podladchikov, 2007; John et al., 2009), fluid and reaction-induced weakening (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019), and the downward propagation of rupturing faults (Petley-Ragan et al., 2019). Fluid and reaction-induced weakening has already been documented in the Reinfjord ultramafic Complex (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019), while other works invoke the downward propagation of rupturing faults to explain similar mutually overprinting brittle and ductile features (Jamtveit et al., 2018; Petley-Ragan et al., 2019; Papa et al., 2020). Other studies conclude that shear zones form along preexisting heterogeneities, like dykes, in ultramafic rocks (Toy et al., 2010). In this paper, we combine field, micro and macrostructural studies with geothermobarometry and document the interplay between dykes, fluids, and deformation in the lower crust, revealing the driving forces behind deep deformation and strain localization in this continental rift system.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThis study was conducted within the Reinfjord Ultramafic Complex (RUC) (Fig. 1\n), part of the Seiland Igneous Province (SIP) in Northern Norway. The SIP constitutes one part of the Central Iapetus Magmatic Province (CIMP) (Ernst and Youbi, 2017; Pu et al., 2016; Youbi et al., 2020; Gumsley et al., 2020). The CIMP consists of the fragments of a single large igneous province (LIP), now spread across Scandinavia, North America, and Southwestern Greenland (Ernst and Bell, 2010; Tappe et al., 2017), formed during terminal breakup of the Rodinian super continent from 610 to 550\u00a0Ma (Kamo et al., 1989; Bingen and Demaiffe, 1998; Cawood et al., 2001; Ernst and Buchan, 2004). As the Iapetus Ocean opened, magma and volatile fluids flooded the rift zones across the modern North Atlantic (Ernst and Bleeker, 2010). The SIP provides excellent exposure of deep, rift-related structures and processes in a high-yielding magmatic conduit system (Grant et al., 2016, 2020; Larsen et al., 2018; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). Like the larger CIMP, the SIP and RUC are associated with continental rifting, based on rock associations (Krill and Zwaan, 1987; Roberts et al., 2006), extensional tectonics (Andr\u00e9asson et al., 1998), geochemical analysis (Reginiussen et al., 1995) and geochronological association (Roberts, 2007; Roberts et al., 2010). Having formed at a minimum of 30\u00a0km depth, the SIP offers a unique window to tectonic and magmatic rifting processes in the lower crust (Larsen et al., 2018).\nDuring LIP magmatism, volatile fluids are channeled from the mantle to the upper crust (e.g. Ernst et al., 2019) along magmatic pathways. Pastore et al. (2016) used 3D gravity modelling to suggest that the SIP is 2\u20134\u00a0km thick with deep roots extending 6\u20139\u00a0km's downwards. These roots are interpreted as magmatic conduits that transported more than 100,000\u00a0km3 of volatile-rich basic, ultrabasic and alkaline melts (Grant et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2018). During rifting, the roots also acted as migration pathways for CO2-rich volatile fluids and melts rich in ore-forming sulfur, volatiles and economic elements (Larsen et al., 2018). The presence of sulfide and platinum group minerals together with carbonates and hydrous minerals demonstrates the importance of volatile-rich melts for the formation and distribution of sulfide mineralizations within the SIP and RUC (Larsen et al., 2018).\nThe RUC is hosted by the Langstrand Gabbronorite, a subalkaline sub-horizontally layered intrusion. Steeply dipping contacts separate the gabbronorite from the RUC peridotites, creating a cylinder of ultramafic rocks within the gabbronorite (Bennett, 1974; Bennett et al., 1986). A series of three major intrusive phases created the RUC, including the lower layered series, upper layered series, and central series, all superimposed by multiple smaller recharge events (Grant et al., 2016). Each series comprises modally layered, cyclic olivine and pyroxene cumulates, of dunitic, wehrlitic and pyroxenitic compositions (Emblin, 1985; Bennett et al., 1986). The central series partially replaced the upper layered series in the RUC, forming a complex intrusive relationship (Grant et al., 2016). Basic, ultrabasic and alkaline dykes intruded the dunitic rocks of the central series through pervasive emplacement mechanisms. As the dyke infiltration localized, pyroxenitic dikes intruded via ductile fracture and eventually brittle-elastic mechanisms (Orvik, 2019). At the same time, wehrlite-gabbronorite dyke swarms and amphibole-bearing carbonate assemblages formed throughout the RUC (Larsen et al., 2018). Later dyke-parallel shear zones reworked some of the dykes, causing intense strain localization along the dyke contacts (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019).\nNumerous authors have documented pre-, syn- and post-magmatic deformation in the SIP and RUC related to continental rifting (Degli Alessandrini et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2020; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). Volatiles played an important role in the post-magmatic deformation of ultramafic rocks. Volume expansion caused by the reaction between olivine, clinopyroxene and C\u2013O\u2013H fluids, formed dolomite and orthopyroxene along olivine grain boundaries and led to micro-fracturing in large olivine grains (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). The reaction caused a grain size reduction and a two order of magnitude decrease in rock strength (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). The grain size reduction increased porosity and permeability, opening the door for fluid migration and metamorphic reactions. The fluid influx and following alteration led to strain localization and an increase in strain rate along the shear zones (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019).\nDespite involvement in the Scandian (420\u00a0Ma) phase of the Caledonian Orogeny, the shear zones in the central series and greater SIP preserve pre-Caledonian deformation events (Pastore et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2018). The Kalakk Nappe, to which the SIP belongs, shows multiple phases of widespread amphibolite facies metamorphism. The exact metamorphic history is difficult to decipher, however during the Caledonian Orogeny some metasediments in the SIP locally experienced high-grade metamorphism, at 550\u2013660\u00a0\u00b0C at 10\u201312\u00a0kb around 430\u2013440\u00a0Ma (Gasser et al., 2015). Despite this, the rocks of the RUC are left relatively unaffected by Caledonian events and escaped later tectonic or metamorphic overprint (Larsen et al., 2018), apart from minor serpentinization at lower greenschist facies conditions.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nSupplementary to our detailed field study, we used microanalysis techniques including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron microprobe analysis (EPMA), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to constrain the mineralogy and deformation mechanisms in our study area. All analyses were carried out in the Norwegian Laboratory for Mineral and Materials Characterization (MiMaC) lab at the Department of Geoscience and Petroleum, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\n\n3.1\nElectron backscatter diffraction\nThin sections of selected samples were chemically polished using OP-U, a 400\u00a0\u00c5 suspended colloidal silica polishing agent, before being rinsed in 96% alcohol, following the procedure outlined in Moen et al., (2003). We conducted the Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analyses on a Hitachi SU-6600 SEM, in variable pressure low vacuum mode at 10\u201315\u00a0Pa, using 20\u00a0kV accelerating voltage and 1.70\u00a0kV extraction voltage. The samples were mounted on metal pedestals at standard eucentric height with a tilt angle of 70\u00b0 and working distance of 22.0\u00a0mm. EBSD patterns were acquired using a NORDIF UF-1000 detector and NORDIF 3.0 software at 240\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240-pixel resolution. The samples were analyzed with a step size of 0.5\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm, depending on grain size and the size of the area. The frame rate and exposure time were adjusted for each sample to accommodate for different mineral assemblages. We selected numerous acquisition and calibration patterns throughout the scanned areas, using the NORDIF interface and electron backscatter image, ensuring that the pattern center remained calibrated across the large area scans. The orientations of the shear zone boundaries near the sample locations were used as a reference system for the orientation and kinematic interpretation of the samples. To avoid geometric trapezoidal scan distortions in the maps, a beam scan voltage correction was implemented using a EM-Tec LAMC-15 Large area magnification calibration standard (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2020). Indexing was done using TSL-OIM 7.2 software. EBSD data cleanup was done according to the procedures described in S\u00f8rensen et al. (2020), checking the consistency of indexing and cleanup procedures. EBSD plotting was done using MTEX (Bachmann et al., 2010) version 5.7. Pole figures were calculated using a de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin kernel with a half width of 10\u00b0, making results comparable between datasets. We used one-point-per-grain to plot the orientation data, as our samples have a highly heterogenous grain size distribution and we aimed to avoid oversampling of large grains following Park and Jung (2020). EBSD KAM maps were constructed from smoothed data using the algorithm for half quadratic filter in MTEX (Hielscher et al., 2019).\n\n\n3.2\nElectron microprobe analysis\nWe analyzed points in olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, feldspar, and carbonate grains using the JEOL JXA-8530F Plus Hyperprobe, the results of which we used for empirical geothermobarometry and thermodynamic modelling, as well as mineral identification. The acceleration voltage and beam current were set to 15\u00a0kV and 10\u00a0nA, respectively, and the defocused beam diameter varied between 1 (pyroxene, olivine, and garnet) and 3 (feldspar, amphibole, and carbonates) \u03bcm. Peak and background counting times varied between 5\u2033 and 2\u2033 for Na, 50\u2033 and 25\u2033 for F, and 20\u2033 and 10\u201d for the remainder of elements. For more accurate matrix corrections, we added a fixed water content of 2 mass percent to the amphibole analyses, and 44.07 mass percent CO2 to the carbonate analyses. Typical detection limits (3\u03c3) varied from 180 (Ca) to 900\u00a0\u03bcg\/g (F). Mineral and pure metal standards from Astimex and Micro-Analysis Consultants were used as reference materials and to monitor samples during the analyses. We analyzed a total of 41 olivine, 102 pyroxene, 55 amphibole, 110 feldspar and 4 carbonate points and applied the data to empirical geothermobarometers to unravel the pressure and temperature conditions during deformation in the Reinfjord Ultramafic Complex. Average representative values of the data are provided in Table 2.\n\n\n3.3\nGeothermobarometry\nWe used a combination of thermodynamic modelling and empirical methods to constrain the pressure and temperature conditions during deformation in the RUC. We created our pseudosection for the peridotite mineral assemblage using Perple_X v. 6.9.1 (Connolly, 1990). and the Holland and Powell (2011) thermodynamic database, with the carbonate solution model from Franzolin et al. (2011), orthopyroxene (Opx(HP)) and clinopyroxene (Cpx(HP)) solution models from Holland and Powell (1996), and olivine solution model (O(HP)) from Holland and Powell (1998). We used the same bulk assemblage as S\u00f8rensen et al. (2019), namely SiO2: 4.43, Al2O3: 0.0235, FeO: 1.27, MgO: 6.02, CaO: 0.525 and CO2 0.980, derived from a linear interpolation of the mineral compositions obtained using EPMA and the amounts of each phase from a syn-tectonic assemblage in a dyke-related shear zone (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). We were unable to model some complex assemblages using Perple_X. For these assemblages we used equations from the amphibole \u2013 amphibole geothermobarometers of Ridolfi et al. (2010) and Ridolfi and Renzulli (2012), and the amphibole - plagioclase geobarometer from Molina et al. (2015). The applicability of each model to our mineral compositions is evaluated in the discussion.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nStructural framework\nA network of shear zones cuts the Reinfjord Ultramafic Complex (RUC) (Fig. 1a). The most prominent is a large extensional to transtensional shear zone dipping approximately 31\u00b0 towards 101\u00b0 (Fig. 1a), referred to as the main shear zone. The main shear zone is oblique to the remainder of the shear zones, which are subvertical and trend to the NNE - SSW. Most of these second order shear zones formed in the footwall of the main shear zone, along hornblende gabbronorite dykes in the peridotite host rocks, as shown in the profile in Fig. 1b. We refer to these shear zones as dyke-related shear zones in the remainder of the text. A digital elevation model (DEM) from the field area shows a high frequency of lineaments (Fig. 1a). We selected and analyzed the orientation of the lineaments from the DEM in a rose diagram (Fig. 1c). Out of the 444 selected lineaments, the orientations correlated to dyke-related shear zones through direct observation during extensive field work form the most prominent peak (Fig. 1c), dominating the structural fabric of the field area. Smaller peaks are attributed to hydrothermal veins and serpentinized fractures (Fig. 1c), neither of which are the focus of this study. The subvertical, NNE-SSW trending shear zones range between less than 1\u00a0cm to over 1\u00a0m in width and can be followed for up to 250\u00a0m along strike. Mineral lineations plunging between 60\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 towards the N \u2013 NE indicate oblique extensional slip (Fig. 1d). Two main areas were selected for detailed investigations. Area 1 is the type locality of the dyke-related shear zones, while Area 2 is the type locality for the main shear zone. Table 1\n provides an overview of key samples from each of the areas.\n\n\n4.2\nPT \u2013 estimates of the Reinfjord Ultramafic Complex\nThermodynamic modelling of a deformed peridotite mineral assemblages from the shear zones indicates high-grade deformation conditions. Following the analysis performed by S\u00f8rensen et al. (2019), we created a pseudosection (Fig. 2\n) for the forsterite, enstatite, diopside, dolomite assemblage using the same bulk assemblage from a syntectonic assemblage in a dyke-related shear zone (in molar amounts) SiO2 - 4.43 Al2O3: 0.0235, FeO: 1.278, MgO: 6.02, CaO: 0.525, and CO2: 0.980. This assemblage is stable over a wide range of PT-conditions, ranging from below 800\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0kbar to above 1100\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0kbar, providing a minimum PT constraint during deformation. The coeval host rock and dyke deformation allow us to estimate PT-conditions using two unrelated mineral assemblages within individual shear zones.\nThe Ridolfi et al. (2010), the updated Ridolfi and Renzulli (2012) and the Molina et al. (2015) models produce variable results (Fig. 2) with pressures between 5.7 and 17.9\u00a0kbar and temperatures between 880\u00b0 and 1130\u00a0\u00b0C. If we base our pressure estimate solely on Molina et al. (2015), with the most representative calibration, we estimate pressures between 11.5 and 15.5\u00a0kbar and temperatures between 860\u00a0\u00b0C and 950\u00a0\u00b0C in the ductile shear zones. We also analyzed recrystallized pseudotachylytes section 4.6\nEvidence of pseudotachylytes) using the same models, which indicate pressures between 9 and 12\u00a0kbar at temperatures between 850\u00b0 and 950\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 2). Notably the temperatures in the pseudotachylyte veins exceed the values of the Olivine\u00a0+\u00a0Diopside carbonation reaction i.e., Ol\u00a0+\u00a0Di\u00a0+\u00a0CO2\u00a0=\u00a0En\u00a0+\u00a0Dol. The bulk assemblages for the pseudosection and the mineral compositions for the empirical models were based on our EPMA data, a summary of which is shown in Table 2\n.\n\n\n4.3\nArea 1 \u2013 dyke-related shear zones\n\n4.3.1\nHigh-strain dyke-related shear zone\n\nFig. 3\n documents a high-strain example of a dyke-related shear zone, along which the dyke material is completely transposed and incorporated into the structure, to the point where the dyke becomes difficult to identify without close inspection. The shear zone extends for 75\u00a0m along strike and varies between 15 and 100\u00a0cm in width. The zone dips steeply (85\u00b0) towards the northwest (320\u00b0), with a pyroxene mineral lineation plunging steeply (75\u201380\u00b0) to the northeast (058\u00b0), indicating a slightly oblique normal shear direction. In the field, such high-strain shear zones are marked by a change in color of the rocks with a more orange to yellow tint on weathered surfaces, a black, glassy appearance on fresh surfaces, and the presence of deformed dykes. The dyke along this shear zone is completely transposed, with only spaced clasts of dyke remaining distributed throughout the shear zone core (Fig. 3a and c). Other dykes are less deformed and more easily identifiable in the field, such as the dyke shown in Fig. 3b. The more well-preserved dykes are discussed in 4.3.2. The location of sample A1-1 is shown in Fig. 3a and the sample in Fig. 3d. The dark bands with a glassy appearance (Fig. 3e) are remnants of the transposed hornblende-gabbronorite dyke, which formed pseudotachylytes during deformation. The sample was cut into two perpendicular thin sections (Figs. 3d and 4a\n). XRD analysis of the deformed host rock, visible in Fig. 4a and b gives the following composition Fo \u2013 78%, En \u2013 8%, Hbl \u2013 6%, Di \u2013 5%, Ant \u2013 3%. The antigorite is constrained to small veinlets, while the trace amounts of dolomite were too low to detect using XRD (<1\u00a0wt%).\nDespite the high-strain nature of the zone we observe a wide range in accumulated strain, with some olivine grains preserving earlier deformation textures (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a shows both thin sections from the high-strain sample (A1-1). A sharp transition separates the preserved peridotite from the high-strain shear assemblage (Fig. 4a and b). The composition of the shear zones near the host rock contains alternating domains of dyke and peridotite material (Fig. 4a), apparently due to irregular dyke boundaries along the shear zones. Dark bands of ultra-fine-grained material cut the dunitic ultramylonite. The ultra-fine-grained material extends locally from domains of more coarse-grained (\u2248100\u00a0\u03bcm EQR) hornblende gabbronorite, but also appear as isolated pockets of dark material in thin sections and cuts discordantly across the shear zone foliation (Fig. 4a and b). Planar deformation features are preserved inside the higher strain zones, where the planes become thick bands of new grains eventually replacing the entire parent grain with peridotite ultramylonite (Fig. 4c). The preserved olivine grains contain minute sets of planar deformation features decorated by new grains (equivalent radius (EQR)\u00a0=\u00a04\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm) (Fig. 4d). EDS and EPMA analyses indicate that these grains are ultra-fine-grained dolomite along microfractures in the olivine. Other dykes exhibit more evidence of fluid infiltration leading to deformation within the host rock, exemplified by the small shear zone extending from a dyke tip into the peridotite host rock in Fig. 4e.\nThree areas of the high-strain sample were mapped using EBSD, denoted by white boxes in Fig. 4a, b and c, revealing various microfabrics along the shear zone (Figs. 5\u20137\n\n\n). Fig. 5 shows the boundary of the shear zone and the interface between the peridotite and dyke assemblages. We divided the data set into 6 regions, predominantly containing olivine, with hornblende and pyroxene in regions 3 and 5 (Fig. 5a). The kernel average misorientations (KAM) are shown for the partly recrystallized parent olivine grains. Numerous planar deformation features follow the traces of crystallographic planes. The features occur primarily along the {1 2 0}, {1 3 0} and {0 1 0} planes and contain 15\u00a0\u03bcm wide bands of new olivine grains and secondary phases enstatite, and minor dolomite and pentlandite (Fig. 5a). Secondary features following other crystallographic directions are also visible in the KAM map, though without significant recrystallization (Fig. 5a). The angular and undulatory boundary between the partly recrystallized parent grains and the fine-grained shear zone is consistent with the observed fracture directions of the parent grain (Fig. 5a), which follow the crystallographic axes shown in Fig. 5d. We observe a progressive weakening and a rotation of the olivine CPO moving from the low to high-strain domains, reflecting a distortion of the parent grain orientation (Fig. 5b) and possibly a change in deformation mechanism. The olivine CPOs in regions 1 and 2 are like the orientation of the large parent grain, though the CPO weakens in region 2 approaching the high-strain domain. Regions 3 and 4 contain very weak a-axis girdles with a weak point maximum in the lineation direction in region 4 and b-axis point maxima near the sample foliation pole (WNW), while the c-axis maxima are random. Region 5 contains minor olivine and shows weak to random CPO, whereas region 6 shows similar CPO to regions 3 and 4 but includes significantly fewer grains over a smaller area. We observe a progressive grain size reduction moving from the low-strain (region 1) to high-strain domains (Fig. 5c). Average grain sizes range from 3.5\u00a0\u03bcm EQR in region 1, excluding the large parent grains, and 2\u00a0\u03bcm EQR in region 6. The misorientation axes for all the olivine grains concentrate around the [0 1 0] direction (Fig. 5e).\n\nFig. 6 shows a deformed and fractured parent olivine grain within the high-strain domain of the shear zone (Fig. 4c). A combined phase and KAM map is shown in Fig. 6a. The map shows enstatite and dolomite, as well as pentlandite or ilmenite along the planar deformation features. In the center of the map, minute amounts of diopside are also present. The planar deformation features following the crystallographic planes are more developed than those documented along the edge of the shear zone. The larger recrystallized features follow the {001}, {120}, and {010} planes in the KAM map. Sections of the relic grains show a distinct planar subgrain structure, whereas other areas tend towards a more cellular subgrain structure. The new grains are a mix of fragments from the parent grains, subgrains and grains generated through subgrain rotation (small grains within the parent grains), and equant recrystallized olivine with distinct triple junctions, possibly related to late recovery. The misorientation of the recrystallized olivine grains (Fig. 6b) is loosely concentrated around 60\u00b0 to the parent grains. In both maps, the recrystallized olivine grains show a relatively uniform grain size distribution, with equant grains and frequent triple junctions. Twist and tilt boundaries crosscut the parent grain and are as expected generally parallel to the crystallographic planes (Fig. 6b).\nThe third EBSD map from a dyke-related shear zone (Fig. 7) documents an ultra-fine-grained assemblage with distinct compositional zoning from the peridotite shear zone to residual material, probably formed during partial melting of the dyke during frictional heating (see\nsection 4.6, Evidence of pseudotachylytes). The phase map (Fig. 7a) was divided into 4 regions, each with a distinct composition (Table 3\n) and texture. Region 1 contains a clast of hornblende pyroxenite restite, formed through partial melting of a hornblende gabbronorite dyke, region 2 consists of what is apparently recrystallized pseudotachylyte, while regions 3 and 4 are most like the peridotite host rock, with the diopside replaced by finely dispersed dolomite and enstatite. Detailed descriptions of the peridotite can be found in Grant et al. (2016) and Larsen et al. (2018), while the evidence of the replacive dolomite and enstatite is thoroughly discussed in S\u00f8rensen et al. (2019). Region 2 has a mixed composition between the dyke and host rock with increased ilmenite and pentlandite, confirmed using EDS. The olivine CPO (Fig. 7c) in the coarse-grained region (Region 4) follows the orientation of a parent grain, with structured local misorientations (Fig. 7a). Moving from region 3 to 1 we observe a progressive weakening of the CPO towards a random configuration. Apart from the parent grains, the average olivine grain size is very fine in all the regions, between 1 and 2\u00a0\u03bcm EQR, with the finest grain sizes in the high strain regions away from the parent grains (Fig. 7d).\n\n\n4.3.2\nLow-strain dyke-related shear zone\nWell-preserved hornblende gabbronorite dykes (Fig. 8\n) allow us to observe the relationship between dykes, host rocks, and shear zones. The hornblende gabbronorite dyke in Fig. 8a may be followed along strike for over 200\u00a0m. Shear zones dipping 74\u00b0 towards 295\u00b0 exploit both sides of the dyke. Most of the strain was accumulated along the ESE hanging wall. Fig. 8b shows a smaller, equally well-preserved dyke with shear zones exploiting both sides of the structure with minute veins of pseudotachylyte cutting across the shear zones. The westerly shear zone is concentrated in large part within the dyke, seen as the dark foliated region to the left of the image. The shear zone exploits both the dyke and the host rocks and appears as a dark and thin foliated band (2\u00a0cm) along the dyke, and a wider (7\u00a0cm) band of lighter colored orange rock, containing mostly fine-grained olivine. Fig. 8c shows the same dyke as Fig. 8b, with a significantly more transposed dyke fabric located elsewhere along the strike of the dyke. Dark veins of pseudotachylyte again cut across the shear zone along discrete planes and have a glassy appearance in the field. We prepared two thin sections (A1-2 and A1-3) from a pair of shear zones on either side of a hornblende gabbro dyke (Fig. 8d) for microstructural and EBSD analysis, sampling was done at an adjacent outcrop to preserve the spectacular main locality.\n\nFig. 9\n shows microstructures from the pair of dyke-related shear zones in Fig. 8d. In Fig. 9a, dark bands of hornblende\u00a0+\u00a0enstatite\u00a0+\u00a0diopside\u00a0+\u00a0ilmenite ultramylonite cut the hornblende gabbronorite dyke. Asymmetric plagioclase porphyroclasts within the hornblende-rich high-strain domains indicate that the WNW block of the shear zone moved downwards (Fig. 9b). The porphyroclasts are surrounded by fine-grained pyroxene, amphibole, and plagioclase (Fig. 9c). The tails of the porphyroclasts are recrystallized, with plagioclase, interstitial dolomite, and sub-\u03bcm oxides. The relationship between the dyke and peridotite is complex, with a small lens of dyke material completely enclosed within the peridotite zone as in Fig. 4a, and lenses of peridotite surrounded by dyke material (Fig. 9d). Along other contacts we observe simpler relationships (Fig. 9e), probably due to the lower amount of strain accumulated along smaller (\u2248100\u00a0\u03bcm wide) shear zones. These better-preserved contacts show evidence of fracturing and fluid infiltration from the dyke into the olivine (Fig. 9e and f) most notably as traces of small carbonate grains along microfractures following crystallographic planes. XRD analyses of the hornblende gabbronorite dyke protolith gave Ab \u2013 30\u00a0wt%, Di \u2013 26%, En \u2013 21%, Hbl \u2013 15%, Ilm \u2013 5%, Bio \u2013 1% and Fo \u2013 1%. The higher-strain assemblages contain less pyroxene and more amphibole: Hbl \u2013 34%,Plg \u2013 30%, Di \u2013 17%, En \u2013 12%, Ilm - 4%, Fo \u2013 2%, and Bio - 2%. The shear zones exhibit a variety of CPOs in different mineral phases. (Figs. 10 and 11\n\n). Sample A1-2 is from entirely within the dyke assemblage (Fig. 10a). Both the plagioclase and hornblende CPO are weak (Fig. 10b). In the highest strain areas (Region 3 and 4) there is minor alignment of the b-axis in plagioclase, with J-indices as high as 1.9 and 2.1, respectively. This could be attributed to inheritance from parent porphyroclasts, though a b-axis maximum normal to the shear zone foliation is expected during the dynamic recrystallization of plagioclase (Mehl and Hirth, 2008). The b-axis maxima are normal to the shear zone boundary, while a weak a-axis girdle is parallel to the boundaries. Hornblende, the most prevalent phase in the shear zone, is very fine-grained (Fig. 10c). Apart from a few preserved parent grains on the periphery of the shear zone, the grain sizes range from 2 to 7\u00a0\u03bcm, with peaks between 3 and 4\u00a0\u03bcm (EQR).\nThe second sample from the pair of shear zones (A1-3) contains peridotite ultramylonite in addition to dyke-derived assemblages (Fig. 11). The contact between the ultramafic lens and the dyke is fine-grained, indicating local accumulation of strain. The olivine grains display similar textures to those in the high-strain shear zones, with fractured parent olivine grains and ultra-fine-grained ultramylonite (Fig. 11a and b). The phase maps from A1-3 (Fig. 11b) show a progressive change from a peridotite to a dyke-related assemblage, from left to right. Between the two lithologies we observe a reaction texture, comprised by a hornblende-bearing zone (R6) towards the gabbronorite dyke and orthopyroxene towards the peridotite (R7). The KAM map (Fig. 11b) shows internal misorientations in the olivine parent grains. There is notably less organization of the internal misorientation structure here compared to the high-strain samples (Figs. 5\u20137). In this sample the local misorientation structures form small cells or subgrains, rather than planar deformation features, as described by Lopez-Sanchez et al. (2021). The bands of recrystallized olivine within the parent grain are more chaotic and significantly thicker than in the high-strain samples. The large parent olivine grains control the CPO, with regions 2\u20134 showing similar CPOs to the large grain in region 1 (Fig. 11c), with weakening in finer-grained domains. The grain size distributions show very fine grain sizes, with most grains less than 5\u00a0\u03bcm (EQR) (Fig. 11d). The misorientation angle diagram (Fig. 11 e), shows a very high frequency of small (<5\u00b0) misorientations, indicating the presence of subgrains in olivine or a relation of new grains to the parent grain. The hornblende CPO are weak, whilst the plagioclase CPO exhibit clear b-axis maxima normal to the shear zone foliation (Fig. 11f). 1\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm (EQR) enstatite and dolomite grains (Fig. 11g) populate the shear zone and are ubiquitous in our samples.\n\n\n\n4.4\nArea 2 - the main shear zone\nThe main shear zone dips 31\u00b0 towards 101\u00b0 with sparse, ESE-trending mineral lineations along a mostly flat-lying foliation and is marked by increasing strain towards the shear zone core (Fig. 12\n). The deformation zone extends over 15\u00a0m into the footwall (Fig. 12a), while the hanging wall is less deformed. Slabs cut in the field reveal only minor serpentinization and a clear S-foliation indicating an ESE transport direction (Fig. 12b). The core of the shear zone is 5\u201310\u00a0m wide (Fig. 12b and c) and fluctuates along strike. We define the core based on the field expression of the shear zone, where a 10\u201320\u00a0m wide and 3- to 4-m-deep depression stretches for 2\u00a0km along strike. Networks of millimeter to centimeter scale ultramylonitic or cataclastic bands brecciate the peridotite (Fig. 12d), while transposed dykes (Fig. 12e), including major gabbronoritic dykes, populate the deformation zone, increasing in intensity towards the main shear zone.\n\n4.4.1\nPetrography of the main shear zone\nThe main shear zone mineral assemblage resembles the dyke-related shear zones, though we observe a more thorough mixing of phases (Figs. 12 and 13\n). Within the most deformed domain, significant strain obliterated fragments of dykes like those observed in the dyke-related shear zones, though we suspect diopside and hornblende-rich lenses may be the remnants of dykes. This is consistent with our observation of large gabbronoritic dykes bordering the main shear zone. Serpentinization is restricted to small veinlets, leaving the structural fabric of the rock intact, though local serpentinization occurred along olivine grain-boundaries. XRD data from sample A2-2 constrained the following assemblage: Ol \u2013 37%, Liz \u2013 28%, Chl \u2013 13%, Hbl \u2013 9%, Talc \u2013 4%, Mag \u2013 3%, Mgs \u2013 3%, Dol \u2013 2%. The fine-grained fabric of the rock makes the separation of individual assemblages difficult, and the analysis includes late alteration phases. Lenses of mafic ultramylonite from deformed dykes crop out along the shear zone and contain the following mineral assemblage: Hbl \u2013 45%, Ab \u2013 43%, Grt \u2013 4%, Bio \u2013 4%, and Ilm \u2013 4% based on XRD.\n\n\n4.4.2\nStructural fabric of the main shear zone\nDistinct strain localization occurred surrounding the main shear zone. Fig. 13 (a) through (c) show thin sections from samples collected with decreasing distance to the main shear plane. The most distal of the thin sections (A2-1) (Fig. 13a) contains a discrete <0.5\u00a0cm band of ultra-fine-grained olivine, part of the irregular network of ultramylonitic or cataclastic bands which rework peridotite (Fig. 12d). The band is surrounded by fractured olivine clasts, while the lower portion of the thin section contains well-preserved olivine with minor serpentine veinlets. Fig. 13b shows a thin section (A2-2) taken adjacent to the highest strain domain of the shear zone. This thin section contains olivine protomylonite and mylonite, as well as lighter areas of altered transposed dykes, containing increased amphibole and pyroxene (Fig. 13b). The final thin section (A2-3) (Fig. 13c) was taken from the core of the main shear zone. Textures surrounding the shear zone show significant strain localization (Fig. 13d). A distinct SC-foliation within the olivine ultramylonite indicates an ESE transport direction (Fig. 13e), consistent with the macrostructures in Fig. 12b. Interstitial secondary phases, including amphibole, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, characterize the olivine fabric (Fig. 13f). The fine-grained texture of the rock stands in contrast to the protolith, which contains olivine grains up to cm size.\nUsing EBSD, we mapped a 3 by 0.5\u00a0mm zone across both olivine-rich and more hornblende and diopside-rich high-strain domains (sample A2-3) (Fig. 14\na). We divided the EBSD map into four regions, based on textural and compositional similarities. The phase map (Fig. 14b) shows dolomite and enstatite grains, and local hornblende and diopside as interstitial grains between olivine. The dolomite is distributed throughout, though the highest concentration occurs together with very fine-grained olivine at the border between regions 1 and 2. A small serpentine veinlet cuts the ultramylonite (Fig. 14c). The vein is discrete and the ultramylonitic fabric is well-preserved. Fig. 14d shows the complex mineral fabric of olivine, amphibole, pyroxenes, and ilmenite typical of the main shear. The darker olivine-rich bands and the lighter olivine\u00a0+\u00a0pyroxene\u00a0+\u00a0amphibole rich bands are ultramylonitic, with an average grain size of 7\u00a0\u03bcm EQR in the olivine-rich domains (region R1) and 4\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm EQR in the pyroxene\/hornblende rich bands (region R4) (Fig. 14e and f). Grain sizes range between 2 and 12\u00a0\u03bcm (EQR) in the olivine regions (Fig. 14e), with the highest strain region (R4) exhibiting the finest olivine grain sizes. Hornblende, enstatite, dolomite, and ilmenite are all extremely fine-grained, with peak grain sizes between 2 and 4\u00a0\u03bcm EQR (Fig. 14f). Rare grains with ca. 75\u00a0\u03bcm EQR remain in the sample. The CPO of olivine is weak in all regions (Fig. 14g), and nearly random with J-indekses between 1.1 and 1.3. The CPO in region 2 may be reminiscent of a weak A-type olivine fabric (Ismail and Mainprice, 1998), particularly for [100] and [010] axes.\nTwo samples are represented in the misorientation angle diagrams, including sample A1-1a (Fig. 15\na) and A2-3 (Fig. 15b). The samples show very similar trends between low strain and high strain domains. The low strain domains, which we here define as areas with preserved parent grains, contain high frequencies of low angle misorientations, significantly greater than expected for both the uncorrelated and untextured misorientation angle frequencies. In contrast, the high strain areas show only very slight increases in low angle misorientations and generally follow the trend of both uncorrelated and untextured olivine misorientations.\n\n\n\n4.5\nEvidence of pseudotachylytes\nWe document dark ultra-fine-grained bands which we interpret as pseudotachylytes (Fig. 16\n). Most of these pseudotachylytes form at the expense of the gabbronoritic protoliths, particularly at the interface between gabbronoritic and peridotite lithologies, with veinlets of pseudotachylyte extending from the gabbronorite into less deformed rocks (Fig. 16a). The formation of pseudotachylytes at dyke \u2013 peridotite interfaces is also particularly apparent in Fig. 4. A section of the pseudotachylyte vein (Fig. 16b) shown in Fig. 16a, now devitrified and recrystallized was used to estimate PT-conditions during recrystallization. The pseudotachylytes exist within the ultramylonites of both gabbroic and dunitic origin (Fig. 16c and d), sometimes cutting the foliation or shear zone fabric obliquely at high angles. The pseudotachylytes contain high concentrations of phases containing incompatible elements as \u2248 1\u20134\u00a0\u03bcm EQR ilmenite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. These phases contribute to the dark, opaque appearance. Continued plastic deformation along the shear zones recrystallized the pseudotachylytes and incorporated them into the ultramylonites. The pseudotachylytes show varying degrees of recrystallization and the relationship between different deformation styles (Fig. 16c, d, e). In Fig. 16e, the different pseudotachylytes are labeled accordingly. The most significant distinguishing factor between the pseudotachylytes, apart from their cross-cutting relationships (Fig. 16d) is the degree to which they have been recrystallized and incorporated into the ultramylonitic fabric of the shear zones. What we interpret as earlier generations of pseudotachylyte are generally coarser grained, showing higher degrees of recrystallization than their more recent counterparts. Grain sizes within the ultramylonites diminish in proximity to the pseudotachylytes, creating ultra-fine-grained assemblages in both the ultramafic and hornblende gabbronorite assemblages (Fig. 16e).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nA single tectonic model accounts for the structural framework constituted by the main shear zone and the dyke-related shear zones. Similar PT-estimates, mineral assemblages, alteration, and microstructures indicate approximately coeval activity along the shear zones within both ultramylonitic and pseudotachylyte domains. There is no evidence of cross-cutting relationship between the dyke-related shear zones and the main shear zone, which could constrain a sequential deformation history. This section considers the evolution of the shear zones as a unified structural framework.\n\n5.1\nGeothermobarometry\nThe pressure and temperature estimates presented in our study indicate slightly higher metamorphic grades than previously published from the Seiland Igneous Province (SIP). Gasser et al. (2015) used thermodynamic modelling and garnet isopleths to model PT conditions of metasedimentary rocks in the southwest SIP. They found pressures between 6.8 and 9.3\u00a0kbar and 730\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 745\u00a0\u00b0C in an assemblage dated to 702\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma and 10\u201312\u00a0kbar and 600\u00a0\u00b0C - 660\u00a0\u00b0C in 420\u2013440\u00a0Ma rocks. On the \u00d8ksfjord Peninsula, Menegon et al. (2011) used thermodynamic modelling to estimate PT conditions during shearing in migmatitic gneisses, with results between 760\u00a0\u00b0C and 820\u00a0\u00b0C and 7.5\u00a0kbar\u20139.5\u00a0kbar. Griffin et al. (2013) estimated PT conditions during magmatic cooling in Nordre Brumannsfjord to 743\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 882\u00a0\u00b0C, with an assumed pressure of 10\u00a0kbar, and the emplacement of gabbroic and ultramafic rocks at 8\u00a0kbar and 10\u00a0kbar respectively. Considering the extent of the SIP, spanning almost 100\u00a0km from the NE to SW corners, it is not surprising that a range of pressure and temperature estimates exists. A complete summary of the existing geothermobarometry is available in Larsen et al. (2018).\nEarlier studies regarding the emplacement conditions of the RUC and its dykes are consistent with our estimates (Grant et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2018; Orvik, 2019). Grant et al. (2016) estimated pressures and temperatures up to 10.5\u00a0kbar and 1120\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively using two pyroxene thermobarometry in the wehrlite. Orvik (2019), estimated pressures between 12 and 14\u00a0kbar and temperatures between 1010 and 1045\u00a0\u00b0C in a variety of dykes, using the Ridolfi et al. (2010) and Molina et al. (2015) empirical models. Larsen et al. (2018) estimated temperatures between 940\u00a0\u00b0C and 1180\u00a0\u00b0C using the methods described in Ridolfi and Renzulli (2012), and pressures between 11.6 and 15.46\u00a0kbar using the method described in Molina et al. (2015). Finally, thermodynamic modelling of mineral assemblages indicates minimum pressures of 9\u00a0kbar (Larsen et al., 2018; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019). The pressure and temperature estimates presented in this study fall within these ranges and indicate very high-grade metamorphic conditions. However, the methods employed by our study and previous studies have limitations.\n\nErdmann et al. (2014) identified shortcomings in pressure estimates based on Ridolfi et al. (2010) and Ridolfi and Renzulli (2012). However, Ridolfi's methods provide adequate temperature estimates, owing to the strong dependence of amphibole composition on temperature (Erdmann et al., 2014). Equation 1d (eq. 1d) from Ridolfi and Renzulli (2012) also provides reasonable pressure estimates (Molina et al., 2015), and is therefore included in our study. The amphibole \u2013 plagioclase Al\/Si partitioning barometer from Molina et al. (2015) removes the short comings of the Ridolfi methods for assemblages between 650\u00a0\u00b0C and 1050\u00a0\u00b0C. Using Ridolfi's methods to estimate temperatures in our rocks and Ridolfi and Renzulli (2012) eq. 1d and Molina et al. (2015) we find temperatures between 850\u00b0\u20131150\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures between 10 and 15\u00a0kbar (Fig. 2). Considering the consistency with previous studies and the applicability of the applied empirical models to our input data, we feel confident in the accuracy of our PT estimates for the given assemblage.\nThe PT analysis of recrystallized pseudotachylytes indicates that pseudotachylyte formation also occurred at lower crustal conditions, with pressures between 9 and 12\u00a0kbar and temperatures between 850\u00b0 and 950\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 2). We interpret the analyzed zone (Fig. 16a and b) to be thoroughly reworked, having first formed as a pseudotachylyte before devitrifying and recrystallizing to the ultra-fine-grained assemblage we analyzed. This removes any uncertainty regarding a potential magmatic origin of the analyzed equilibrium state. It should be noted that while the analysis of a recrystallized pseudotachylyte does not directly indicate the conditions during pseudotachylyte formation, the similarity of the PT-estimates from rocks both cut by (A1-2 and A1-3) and post-dating the pseudotachylytes (Molina Pst) (Fig. 12) make a strong argument for the formation of the pseudotachylytes having taken place at lower crustal conditions. Considering the progressive exhumation and cooling of the lower crustal RUC described by Larsen et al. (2018), any later recrystallization and re-equilibrium of the pseudotachylyte assemblage would have resulted in lower PT estimates than correct for the formation of the pseudotachylytes. As such, we consider our PT estimates to be minimum estimates for the RUC pseudotachylytes, strengthening our interpretation of a lower crustal origin.\nWhile our PT-estimates seem accurate, uncertainties exist as to what the values represent. The high temperatures (850\u00b0\u20131150\u00a0\u00b0C) indicate that the main shear zone and dyke-related shear zones formed shortly after the emplacement of the RUC, while the ambient temperature was still high. The pressure estimates (10\u201315\u00a0kbar) place the structures in the lower crust, consistent with the geodynamic setting proposed by Roberts et al. (2006) and Larsen et al. (2018) for the RUC and S\u00f8rensen et al. (2019) for the dyke-related shear zones. However, the direct relation of our samples to high-strain shear zones complicates the interpretation of these structures. Viscous dissipation causes elevated temperatures during ductile deformation (Griggs and Baker, 1969; Braeck and Podladchikov, 2007) while volume-expansion documented in these shear zones (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019) and the generation of melt could lead to locally elevated pressures. Such locally elevated pressures related to frictional melts have been documented in structures linked to lower crustal earthquakes (Zhong et al., 2021), although it is unlikely that short lived temperature and pressure fluctuations like those documented in our study would cause re-equilibration in the mineral assemblage, recrystallized after the frictional melting event. In addition, later re-equilibration in the ascending RUC (Larsen et al., 2018) would have resulted in lower pressure and temperature estimates. This adds to our confidence that the pseudotachylytes did form in the lower crust, at elevated pressures, reaching temperatures above 800\u00a0\u00b0C during deformation.\n\n\n5.2\nShear zone development\n\n5.2.1\nInitial deformation and the role of magmatic fluids\nThe shear zones form along pre-existing heterogeneities, namely dyke-host rock contacts, as described in similar lithologies by Toy et al. (2010), often extending into the peridotite away from the dykes themselves, or obliterating the dyke completely (Fig. 3). The frequency of transposed dykes in the deformation zone surrounding the main shear zone, and dykes which by geometrical association must have been included in the main shear zone core indicates that magmatic activity was important for the development of all shear zones in the RUC. The peridotite was apparently altered along the dykes before or during shearing, allowing strain to localize in the stronger rocks. The olivine grains adjacent to the dyke-related shear zones may have been primed for deformation by the intrusion of the dykes. We document evidence of fluid infiltration from the dyke into olivine grains (Fig. 4d and e, and 9f). Our samples contain an increase in dolomite adjacent to the dykes, including in the main shear zone where the remnants of dykes are highly transposed, but still observed as hornblende- and diopside-rich lenses with significant dolomite. During dyke emplacement, reactions between olivine, orthopyroxene, and C\u2013O\u2013H magmatic fluids formed enstatite and dolomite-bearing assemblages, as thoroughly described by S\u00f8rensen et al. (2019). The formation of carbonates (<1\u00a0\u03bcm EQR) and enstatite along microfractures weakened the olivine grains, providing a locus for deformation. The microfractures in the olivine grains allowed the fluids to migrate through what were originally single crystals, weakening the rock and contributing to strain localization. Locally, the alteration reaction reversed, with the formation of sub-micrometer interstitial diopside amongst the recrystallized olivine grains (Fig. 6a). The equilibration temperature of the pseudotachylyte assemblage exceeds the PT-stability of the dolomite\u00a0+\u00a0enstatite assemblage (Fig. 12), hence it would be expected that at least some decarbonation resulted from the frictional heating, something that is confirmed by rarity of enstatite-dolomite grain contacts and diopside inside the shear zones. Frictional heating may have broken down the dolomite and released CO2 for continued migration along the shear zone. The most important result of fluid migration is the introduction and distribution of new phases along the grain boundary network, which helped maintain very fine grain sizes (2\u20134\u00a0\u03bcm EQR) during later deformation. The grain size reduction created a much weaker rock, by a factor of 100 (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2019), setting the stage for intense strain localization.\nThe frequency of shear zones along specific dyke lithologies illustrates the relationship of the shear zones to volatile fluids. The shear zones develop preferentially along volatile-rich hornblende gabbronorite dykes, whereas the majority of pyroxenite and lamprophyre dykes are left undeformed and offset by the shear zones. Volatile content may also have controlled the width of the dyke-related shear zones, with the highest volatile contents leading to wider zones of microfracturing in the peridotite. The microfracturing of olivine grains and extent of the shear zones into the peridotite host rock also suggests that the presence of volatiles, rather than a weak dyke rheology, was paramount in localizing deformation. Had the weak dyke been the cause of strain localization, rather than the fluids, we would expect strain to localize entirely within the dyke and not in the surrounding host rock.\n\n\n5.2.2\nSubgrain structure in relic olivine grains\nSubgrain structures exist within the parent olivine grains, including planar deformation features and subgrain cells. The processes which first generated the planes of new grains appear to have continued, creating wider zones of new grains, and locally replacing the parent grains with a polymineralic fine-grained mass. Within the parent grains, the planar structures follow specific crystallographic orientations and are precursory to the recrystallized fractures within the same grains, which are themselves characterized by the alteration assemblage of dolomite and enstatite. Examples of such subgrain structures are documented for olivine in chondrites (Carter et al., 1968; Ruzicka and Hugo, 2018), and other minerals in extremely high-stress environments (Austrheim et al. (2017), and references therein) formed through processes unlikely to have occurred within the RUC. The subgrain cells identified in KAM maps are very similar to textures described by Lopez-Sanchez et al. (2021) attributed to subgrain rotation in olivine. That study also documents a weakening of CPO in fine-grained olivine without invoking grain boundary sliding, but rather through subgrain rotation. Other studies (Druiventak et al., 2012; Matysiak and Trepmann, 2012, 2015) have investigated deformation in olivine at similar lower crustal conditions and identified similar structures formed during transient changes in differential stress as a part of the deep earthquake cycle.\nIn our rocks, the characteristic subgrain structures and prevalence of both twist and kink subgrain boundaries (Fig. 5) confirm the plastic deformation within the large olivine grains. We suggest that the formation of these structures was vital to shear zone development, weakening the peridotite host rock, increasing permeability, locally reducing grain size, and even controlling the position of the shear zone boundaries. The fine grain size was maintained by the presence of secondary phases pinning the grain-boundaries. As deformation progressed, strain localized within the polyphase domains through grain-size sensitive creep, similar to the deformation focusing mechanism described by Toy et al. (2010).\n\n\n5.2.3\nDeformation mechanisms in shear zones\nOur EBSD datasets document a variety of deformation mechanisms in the shear zones. Locally, olivine grains exhibit CPO which may be compared to the well-established type fabrics (Ismail and Mainprice, 1998). The development of subgrain cells in olivine, visible in the KAM maps (Figs. 5\u20137 and 11) necessitates activity along at least three slip systems in olivine (Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2021). While most of our EBSD analyses resulted in pole figures showing very weak CPOs, some of the larger grains and corresponding fine-grained areas with preserved parent grains show weak type fabrics. The statistical significance of the coarse-grained areas is questionable. We suggest the fine-grained areas to have inherited their fabrics from the parent grains, rather than having formed an actual type fabric, as described by Druiventak et al. (2012). Alternatively, the fabrics could have developed from an initial stage of dislocation glide, as documented in olivine during the initial development of planar deformation features (Matysiak and Trepmann, 2012, 2015). While the new fine-grained regions show a strong orientation related to the parent grains, the more distal fine-grained areas have weaker to random CPOs with lower J-indices, generally not reflecting any fabric at all. Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the ultramafic portion of a dyke-related shear zone (A1-1) (Fig. 5), show stronger fabrics and are comparable to A-type fabrics, as the thin section was oriented normal to the transport direction of the shear zone. We attribute this fabric to the large olivine grain (Fig. 5a), creating a local single grain fabric (Fig. 5b). The areas with the finest-grain size (which indicates significant strain and recrystallization) exhibit relatively weak to random CPOs (Fig. 14). It is probable that the weak to random CPOs are related to diffusion accommodated grain boundary sliding, which may form CPOs in olivine (Drury et al., 2011). The activity of grain boundary sliding is supported by the fine grain size within the shear zones, as well as the wide-spread presence of interstitial phases. The transition from a high frequency of low-angle misorientations in areas near or containing parent grains and characterized by lower strain, to a low frequency of low-angle misorientations in high-strain areas also suggests the activation of diffusion grain boundary sliding in the shear zones (Czapli\u0144ska et al., 2015). It should be noted that some studies report strong CPOs resulting from dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (Hansen et al., 2011, 2012), though in our samples only weak to random CPOs develop. This difference could in part be due to the complex mineral assemblage and deformation conditions in nature, compared to the well-controlled conditions in the Hansen et al. (2011) and (2012) experiments. Our results also show a weakening of the CPO in finer grained areas, probably due to a transition to diffusion-accommodated grain boundary sliding or diffusion creep from dislocation creep, consistent with other previous work (Bestmann and Prior, 2003; Warren and Hirth, 2006).\nThe sample from the main shear zone (A2-3) (Fig. 14) and dyke-related shear zone samples (A1-2 and A1-3) (Figs. 10 and 11) allow us to compare deformation across a variety of assemblages. The CPOs in A1-2, from the mafic portion of the dyke-related shear zone (Fig. 10) are probably related to a multitude of processes. The highest strain region (R4) has clear, though weak, hornblende and plagioclase CPO's. The hornblende CPO is likely only indicative of the rigid body rotation of amphiboles documented from magmatic flow and in solid-state deformed rocks (Berger and St\u00fcnitz, 1996). The plagioclase CPO (Figs. 10b and 11f) may indicate a combination of dislocation creep in the bands dominated by plagioclase and components of grain boundary sliding in the finer-grained zones with mixed composition (Mehl and Hirth, 2008). It is difficult to assess why there is a lack of clear CPO in the remaining regions. The fine grain size and presence of interstitial phases could have contributed to significant grain boundary sliding and diffusion, as the secondary phases helped maintain the fine grain size (Warren and Hirth, 2006; Linckens et al., 2011). As strain localized in the fine-grained regions with significant secondary phases, diffusion creep may have played a dominant role in facilitating deformation in both the hornblende gabbronorite and the peridotite with enstatite and dolomite and promoted weak to non-existent CPO (Linckens et al., 2011).\n\n\n5.2.4\nPseudotachylyte formation\nWe interpret the dark, ultra-fine-grained bands cutting the ductile deformation fabrics as pseudotachylytes. Pseudotachylytes are only rarely perfectly preserved in nature, with vastly fewer pseudotachylytes recorded than the number of lower crustal earthquakes documented (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013). The pseudotachylytes in our samples, having formed at ambient metamorphic conditions as high as 12\u00a0kbar and 900\u00a0\u00b0C, are, as expected for pseudotachylytes formed at these conditions (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013), completely recrystallized. The most convincing evidence that these features are in fact pseudotachylytes includes the injection vein (Fig. 16a and c), as well as numerous injection veins at the outcrop scale, discrete bands of dispersed immiscible sulfide grains in the recrystallized matrix and the higher content of incompatible elements agreeing with the expected composition of partial melting (Fig. 16b). Finally, flow banding and swirls around relic clasts within the recrystallized pseudotachylytes, following Table 1 in (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013), confirm their origin as frictional melts.\nOf critical importance in our field area is the presence of the hornblende gabbronorite dykes. All melts with a traceable origin in our samples originate from lenses of the dykes within the peridotite ultramylonite, or from within the dyke-derived portion of the shear zones. More specifically, the pseudotachylytes form at the interface between ultramafic and dyke-material, with most melting taking place within the dyke material. The core of the main shear zone also contains small domains of what may be recrystallized pseudotachylyte, the origin of which is unclear. We speculate that the most likely origin is hornblende gabbronorite dykes which have either been completely obliterated by extreme strain or are adjacent to the shear zone at depth. The higher offset main shear zone presents a lower preservation potential than the similarly deformed, but lower offset, dyke-related shear zones (Kirkpatrick and Rowe, 2013).\n\n\n\n5.3\nOrigin of lower crustal earthquakes\nThe abundant pseudotachylytes along the well-preserved dyke-related shear zones record numerous deep earthquakes. Many models for the generation of deep earthquakes exist, including self-localizing thermal runaway, the downward propagation of stress from shallow ruptures, and fluid and reaction-induced weakening (Jamtveit et al., 2018; Petley-Ragan et al., 2019; Papa et al., 2020). We are not convinced that the structures documented in this study were formed through self-localizing thermal runaway, as such processes may not generate enough heat to form melts, due to significant conductive heat loss (Platt, 2015). Grain boundary sliding, as indicated by our study, is cited as a potential precursor to thermal runaway (Kelemen and Hirth, 2007), though it may also have a prohibitive effect due to the reduction of attainable stresses (Thielmann, 2018). It should be noted that earlier works have proposed the same mechanism for the generation of intermediate-depth earthquakes and peridotite pseudotachylytes in other areas (Deseta et al., 2014). The downward propagation of stress, while plausible and well-documented in other areas (Jamtveit et al., 2018), is not a prerequisite for the structures observed in the RUC. Jamtveit et al. (2018) suggest that the most important effect of downward propagating earthquakes is the increase in permeability along which fluids infiltrate the rocks. We also observe an increase in permeability in the RUC; though in this case related to the emplacement of volatile-rich melts and associated micro-fracturing. The increase in permeability allowed fluids to penetrate the peridotite rocks and led to fluid-induced metamorphic reactions. Deformation localized around the volatile-rich hornblende gabbronorite dykes and in the surrounding peridotite. Thus, magmatic activity via micro-fracturing and fluid reactions causes significant weakening leading to lower crustal earthquakes recorded by the pseudotachylytes. This deep, brittle failure was only made possible via magmatic activity, the emplacement of the dykes, and processes (i.e., fluid infiltration, strain localization) caused by the dykes, a testament to the vital role magmatism plays in localizing deformation within continental rifts. The outcrops documented in this work appear to be an in-situ example of the processes occurring at depth in the East African Rift, as described by La Rosa et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nOur results document deformation processes promoted by local heterogeneities and magmatic fluids, leading to deep earthquakes in the lower crust, as summarized in Fig. 17\n. We documented deformation through a series of five steps:\n\n(1)\nDyke emplacement leading to micro-scale fracturing, grain size reduction, and fluid infiltration in the peridotite host rock.\n\n\n(2)\nThe development of subgrain structures in olivine, including planar deformation features, sub grain cells, and new grains through dislocation creep and corresponding subgrain rotation.\n\n\n(3)\nDiffusion accommodated grain boundary sliding and diffusion in fine-grained olivine, accommodated by the presence of secondary interstitial phases within the olivine, inhibiting grain growth despite high temperatures. The high frequency of interstitial phases is related to the presence of dykes and fluid-rock reactions along the dyke-host rock interfaces.\n\n\n(4)\nThe formation of pseudotachylytes during seismic failure caused by the formation of weaker secondary phases and extreme grain size reduction.\n\n\n(5)\nA decrease in strain rate due to stress release, followed by cooling caused the devitrification, mylonitization, and recrystallization of the pseudotachylytes. Heating and cooling during deformation events may have caused repeated carbonation and decarbonation reactions, potentially linking seismicity and CO2 emissions in rift systems, such as the East African Rift.\n\n\n\nThe new field evidence documented in this work has important implications for our understanding of deformation and fluid migration in lower crustal mantle-derived ultramafic rocks. The presented evidence documents an example of lower crustal earthquakes, which formed due to local weakening processes along dyke-host rock interfaces, and probably without the outside influence of a remote stress trigger. We hope that our field-based evidence will help extrapolate results from experimental studies and theoretical models to the natural world, thereby improving understanding of deformation and fluid migration from the mantle and lower crust towards the upper crust and finally atmosphere.\n\n\nCRediT author statement\n\nEric J.

The area represents a fold belt involving Cambrian to recent sediments of the Arabian Shield detached on the Proterozoic-Early Cambrian Hormuz evaporites (Fig. 2\n). The presence of hydrocarbons in the anticlines, as well as excellent outcrop conditions with extruding salt glaciers have stimulated a large variety of studies by both, academia and industry, over the last few decades (a lot of bibliography is given in Jahani et al., 2017 and Mouthereau et al., 2012). Despite such a volume of work, there remain many questions, such as the degree of involvement the basement had below the Hormuz salt layer on the deformation. Studies on seismicity originally attributed much of the seismicity to deformation on high angle reverse faults in the basement (e.g. Talebian and Jackson, 2004). Recent studies used relocated focal depth estimates and concluded that most of the seismicity is within the competent rocks of the mid-lower sedimentary cover, above the basement (Nissen et al., 2011, 2014) where it deforms dominantly by aseismic creep. Seismicity may indicate the location of active deformation (either in the basement, in the cover, or both), however, it does not provide a quantitative measure on how much this deformation contributed to the present-day finite state. The quantification of deformation is critical to adequately describe the orogenic processes and it is a key factor generating (potentially predictive) models for geo-energy exploration.\nA common way to quantify regional deformation is the construction of balanced cross sections. Numerous balanced sections across the SE Fars area have been published (e.g. Alavi, 2007; Molinaro et al., 2005; Jahani et al., 2009, Fig. 3\n) and their differences visually highlight that there is still a high level of uncertainty. The various sections significantly differ in structural style and shortening ratios (Fig. 3, Table 1\n). Some of the sections show major shortening in the basement, while others indicate only a minor involvement. Some of the previous models\u2019 uncertainty potentially relate to the fact that the interpretations were completed to conform with a certain geometrical deformation model in mind, which may or may not have been adequate (see Bond et al., 2007; Butler et al., 2018). The quality of input data, such as the stratigraphic thicknesses, and the possibility to access them may be another source of uncertainty (Judge and Allmendinger, 2011; Allmendinger and Judge, 2013). The uncertainties related to such a stratigraphic template are related to quality and selection of the sources used, e.g. outcrop and map data (Allmendinger and Judge, 2013) or, alternatively, well data, seismic reflection profiles with corresponding interpretation and depth conversion. The thickness increase of the stratigraphy from one side of the section to the other (\u201cstratigraphic taper\u201d of Allmendinger and Judge, 2013) or the dip variation of the d\u00e9collement level\/top basement from deformed to restored section present additional parameters strongly affecting the outcome of the section balancing. The combined effect of all uncertainties is that any single solution section maybe insufficiently constrained. Butler et al. (2018) showed that for several published sections there is a significantly greater range of solutions admissible than suggested by singular ones, including thin- and thick-skinned solutions for the same section. They recommended several points to improve the understanding of fold-thrust systems and the subsurface interpretation of structures, including proper documentation of the workflows used, performing multiple interpretations and models, and the consideration of disharmonic folding.\nIn our study area, we constructed two balanced sections. As mentioned above, we are aware that these sections have uncertainties and alternative solutions could be considered as admissible. However, the construction of multiple detailed balanced sections with alternative solutions was out of scope for this study. Therefore, we supplement our balanced cross sections with an assessment and discussion of the main input uncertainties. Furthermore, we use a simple area balancing technique to be able to quantify the influence of these uncertainties as differences in calculated shortening. Finally, we critically discuss the deformation style of our balanced section, using various observations and geological reasoning to support our anticipated model. It is a challenging task, describing large uncertainties on one-hand and arguing for a plausible geological solution on the other. In comparison to other studies showing single solution sections, it may appear that we second-guess the plausibility of our own solutions by highlighting the uncertainties. However, we think that this holistic approach is more valuable and honest since it allows the reader to better judge the quality of the presented cross-sections. Through our approach alternative models are more easily developed if additional data becomes available in the future.\n\n1.1\nSetting\nThe Zagros Fold-and-Thrust Belt is located along the NE margin of the Arabian Plate extending over more than 1,800\u00a0km from northern Iraq to the Strait of Hormuz. It formed as the result of collision between the subducting NE Arabian margin and Eurasia, displaying the continuous closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean, that started in the Late Cretaceous and continues until the present-day (Dewey et al., 1973; Berberian, 1995; Talbot and Alavi, 1996; McQuarrie et al., 2003; Mouthereau et al., 2012).\nThe study area is situated in southernmost part of the Zagros Fold-and-Thrust Belt (Fig. 1 inset). The Zagros is traditionally subdivided into different structural segments (north to south): the Kirkuk embayment, the Lorestan arc (Pusht-e Kuh arc), the Dezful embayment, the Khuzestan recess (Izeh Zone) and the Fars arc (Sepehr and Cosgrove, 2004; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2011; Mouthereau et al., 2012 and references therein). Orogen parallel some main faults and lineaments are commonly defined, separating tectonic domains: (1) Zagros Suture\/Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone - Main Zagros Thrust (MZT), (2) Imbricated Zone - High Zagros Fault (HZF), (3) High Folded Zone or Simply Folded Belt - Mountain front fault or flexure (MFF) (4) Foothill zone - Zagros Deformation Front (ZDF), (5) foreland basin (Berberian, 1995; Sepehr and Cosgrove, 2004; Jassim and Goff, 2006; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2011). In the south-eastern Fars Arc area this subdivision is not well defined. The HZT runs close to the MZF (Fig. 1) and the MFF is not present as an unambiguous structural step (see Fig. 3 and inset map in Fig. 1) and thus is not regarded in Fig. 1. Therefore, the Simply Folded Belt and the Foothills zone can be treated as one single tectonic zone in the Southern Fars area that is separated from the foreland by the Zagros deformation front (Fig. 1).\nBased on seismicity analysis and GPS velocities, the convergence in the SE Zagros is approximately orthogonal to the existing structural grain (Talebian and Jackson, 2004; Masson et al., 2007; Sella et al., 2002). Seismicity in the Simply Folded Belt is dominated by blind thrusting and concentrated in the upper 20\u00a0km of the crust (Nissen et al., 2011). Nissen et al. (2011, 2014) consider most of the seismicity in the Simply Folded Belt to be contained within the competent rocks of the sedimentary cover. The centroid depth estimates by body waveform modelling by several authors vary significantly as discussed in Nissen et al. (2014 and references therein). Consequently, some uncertainty in the interpretation of seismicity data need to be considered.\nGeometrical parameters like the surface slope (\u03b1) and the dip of the basal d\u00e9collement (\u03b2) are important to understand the regional deformation in fold-and-thrust belts (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen et al., 1984). The regional surface dip in the Fars is low (below 0.5\u00b0, Mouthereau et al., 2006, and own assessments). The dip of the basal d\u00e9collement could be estimated from reflection seismic data if the data quality would allow it. Mouthereau et al. (2006) consider a \u03b2 of 0.5\u00b0 based on restoration (from McQuarrie et al., 2003) and gravity inversion (Snyder and Barazangi, 1986) as well as observations from seismotectonics (Hatzfeld et al., 2003). For the latter, the basal detachment is assumed to run approximately parallel to the Moho.\n\nSnyder and Barazangi (1986) report 1\u20132\u00b0 dipping Moho with an increase to 5\u00b0 below the suture zone. A crustal cross section in the Fars from Pirouz et al. (2017), based on data from Manaman et al. (2011) and Stolk et al. (2013), shows Moho dips from the foreland to the suture in the range from 1\u20134\u00b0 (depending on position).\nA low taper angle (around 1\u00b0) and non-uniform vergence of the folds were attributed to a thin-skinned fold-thrust belt controlled by the weakness of the salt d\u00e9collement (e.g. Davis and Engelder, 1985). Similar conclusions were drawn from analogue modelling results using silicon putty as analogue material for salt (Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003). In contrast, Mouthereau et al. (2006) used critical taper analysis on sections in the western Fars area and concluded that a thick layer of salt (relative to its overburden) is too weak to support significant surface topography. Instead, they conclude, that a viscous detachment in the basement is required to explain the surface topography.\nInfluence by basement faults on deformation in the Fars has been postulated by various authors. Motamedi et al. (2012) showed that thickness variation in the sedimentary pile inherited from basement geometry is controlling structural style variations between the Eastern Fars and the Gavbandi High (Fig. 1). They infer from stratigraphic pinch-outs, formed during Cretaceous and Cenozoic times, that fault activity decreased but did not terminate. Jahani et al. (2017) concluded that syn-depositional extensional faults controlled the distribution and thickness of the Hormuz salt.\nThe Hormuz salt does not only control the deformation as the basal d\u00e9collement, but also has a significant impact on the halokinetic history and the presence of diapirs pre- and syn-shortening (Callot et al., 2012; Jahani et al., 2017; Snidero et al., 2019; Santolaria et al., 2021a, b).\nThe analysis of seismic reflectors indicates that salt activity started shortly after the deposition of the Hormuz Formation (Perotti et al., 2016 and references therein, Jahani et al., 2009; Motamedi et al., 2011). Most diapiric salt basins continue to evolve until the source layer is largely evacuated, so it is likely that depletion of salt is the most common reason why diapirs stagnate (Jackson and Hudec, 2017). Welds partly developed around some diapirs, explaining the burial of some diapirs (Callot et al., 2012). Those diapirs well connected to the salt source layer continue to grow. Buried diapirs show thin, elevated drape cover which indicate a continuous slow rise (Perotti et al., 2016; Callot et al., 2012). Perotti et al. (2016) evaluates the non-piercing diapirs south of the ZDF and conclude that their upward movement is controlled by the regional sedimentation rate. However, diapirs within the fold belt may have a more complex history related to tectonic movements. Based on detailed field work on halokinetic sequences Snidero et al. (2019) were able to date primary and a secondary welding of the squeezed Darmadan salt diapir. The primary weld was already formed in Early Cretaceous. Reactivation and rejuvenation due to the onset of contractional deformation in the internal Zagros and Oman during the Late Cretaceous is also recorded and secondary welding occurred during the late Miocene Darmadan anticline development (Snidero et al., 2019).\n\n1.1.1\nTectonostratigraphic evolution\nThe oldest compartments of the Arabian plate formed in the Middle to Late Proterozoic (800-650\u00a0Ma) when a series of island arcs and micro-continental fragments accreted against the northeastern margin of the African craton to form the Gondwana super-continent (Beydoun, 1991; Husseini, 1988, 2000; Genna et al., 2002). Basement rocks in the Zagros are known from the few fragments transported by Hormuz diapirs to the surface. These consists of granite, gabbro, basalt, amphibolite and schist (Harrison, 1930; Kent, 1979; Haynes and McQuillan, 1974).\nFrom the latest Proterozoic to the Late Paleozoic, the regions of Arabia, Turkey, central and northwest Iran formed as part of the northern passive margin of Gondwana, bordering the Paleo-Tethys Ocean (Beydoun, 1993; Stampfli and Borel, 2004; Gharabeigli, 2014; Motamedi and Gharabeigli, 2019). The Hormuz Series, which was deposited in evaporitic basins during the latest Proterozoic-Early Cambrian, consists of salt, anhydrite, dolomite, shale, volcanic and metamorphic blocks (Ala, 1974). These units are thought to have been deposited in an extensional pull-apart basin setting related to the Najd strike-slip fault system that affected the north-eastern part of the Gondwana (Husseini, 1988, 2000; Edgell, 1996; Talbot and Alavi, 1996; Sharland et al., 2001; Alavi, 2004). Recent studies indicate that halokinetic movements in those areas with thick rock salt started already soon after deposition and influenced the deposition of the Phanerozoic sediments in their vicinity (Callot et al., 2012; Jahani et al., 2017). The large Silurian-Carboniferous sedimentary gap (Fig. 2) in the Zagros is apparently the effect of epeirogenic movements of the Hercynian Orogeny, which led to a regional regression and general emergence of the region (Konert et al., 2001; Faqira et al., 2009; Frizon de Lamotte et al., 2013; Vennin et al., 2015). During the Late Permian to Early Triassic, crustal stretching and rifting occurred to the north of the study area leading to the Triassic separation of the Iranian plate from the rest of Gondwana along basement fabrics parallel to the present Main Zagros Thrust (Husseini, 1988, 2000; Sepehr and Cosgrove, 2004, Fig. 1). This tectonic phase is associated with a shallow marine transgression during the Permian and the deposition of basal coastal clastic rocks (Faraghan Formation) overlying the Ordovician and Silurian units (Berberian and King, 1981; Alavi, 2004; Zamanzadeh et al., 2009; Szabo and Kheradpir, 1978; Konert et al., 2001). Marine carbonate sedimentation commenced in the Late Permian and Early Triassic (Koop et al., 1982; Setudehnia, 1978; Dehram Group, Fig. 2). In the Middle-Late Triassic the area was occupied by an evaporitic platform with transitions into dolomites toward the High Zagros area, suggesting a connection to the Tethys (Setudehnia, 1978; Szabo and Kheradpir, 1978 and Murris, 1980; James and Wynd, 1965). The Dashtak Fm. is an important evaporitic detachment layer in some areas of the Fars (Gharabeigli, 2014; Motamedi and Gharabeigli, 2019).\nThe Jurassic to Middle Cretaceous on the northeastern edge of the Arabian Plate is dominated by carbonate passive margin deposition (Alavi, 2004; Sharland et al., 2001). The area was tectonically unaffected during this period resulting in the deposition of several mega-sequences with minor hiatuses (Alavi, 2004; Gharabeigli, 2014; Motamedi and Gharabeigli, 2019; Lasemi and Jalilian, 2010). The Khami Group consists of the carbonate Surmeh, the evaporitic Hith, the carbonate Fahliyan, the marly Gadvan and the carbonate Darian formations (James and Wynd, 1965, Fig. 2) The Bangestan Group contains of the shaly-marly Kazhdumi, the carbonate Sarvak, the marly Lafan and the carbonate Ilam formations (James and Wynd, 1965; Fig. 2). During latter stages of Bangestan Group deposition, ophiolite obduction started at the SW margin of the Neotethys, starting in Oman (Coniac\/Santon) younging towards the NW Iranian Zagros (Mastrichian; Stoneley, 1990; Searle et al., 2014; Agard et al., 2011). The contractional deformation leads to the development of a foredeep basin filling with the Campanian-Maastrichtian Gurpi Fm. (Sherkati and Letouzey, 2004; Piryaei et al., 2010, 2011; Orang et al., 2017; Saura et al., 2015). For the Southeastern Fars area, the foredeep depocenter progressively migrated toward the west during the Paleocene and Eocene sedimentation of the marly Pabdeh Fm (Orang et al., 2017). The Paleocene Jahrum carbonates represent the inner to outer ramp depositional deposits of this basin (Orang et al., 2017; James and Wynd, 1965) transitioning into Sachun dolomites and gypsum in northern part of the Fars area (James and Wynd, 1965; Alavi, 2004).\nContinental collision probably began in the late Oligocene at the northern promontory of the Arabian plate (Stoneley, 1981; McQuarrie et al., 2003; Agard et al., 2011; Gharabeigli, 2014; Motamedi and Gharabeigli, 2019). In the study area, the Oligocene sequence is characterized by the marine carbonate unit of the Asmari Fm. overlain by Upper Oligocene to Lower Miocene Gachsaran Fm. To the southeast these formations are replaced by the evaporitic beds of the Fars Group (Snidero et al., 2019; Orang et al., 2017). The continental lateral equivalents to the north are the Razak sandstones and marls. The Miocene Mishan Formation is the uppermost marl layer in the region. It comprises the Guri limestone at its base (Alavi, 2004). Thickness variations in the Mishan indicate early development of depocenters, related to early contractional deformation (Mouthereau et al., 2007). The Mid-Miocene - Pliocene Agha Jari Formation indicate the progressive propagation of deformation and folding in Fars (Mouthereau et al., 2007). This formation is unconformably overlain by Pliocene Bakhtiari conglomerates (Blanc et al., 2003; Letouzey and Sherkati, 2004; Molinaro et al., 2005; Sherkati et al., 2005; Mouthereau et al., 2007; Stephenson et al., 2007; Lacombe et al., 2011; Mouthereau, 2011; Tavani et al., 2011a; Gharabeigli, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n2\nData and methods\nThe study presented here is an outcome of a joint geoscientific study of NIOC and OMV in which more than 20 geoscientists worked for two years on improving the understanding of the hydrocarbon prospectivity of the area. The study material consisted of confidential data from NIOC [seismic and well data (Supplementary Fig. 1), high resolution geological maps] as well as data acquired for the joint study in the field complemented by public domain data.\nThe overarching multidisciplinary study significantly improved our understanding of the structural evolution in the Southern Fars. Most relevant work items for our study are reprocessing of seismic data, on- and offshore seismic interpretation, building of velocity models for time to depth conversion, modelling and interpretation of potential field geophysical data, reviewing well data (formation tops, petrophysical logs and evaluations), well correlations, depositional environment mapping, field work for facies and structural analysis (especially considering the diapirs), analogue and geometric\/kinematic modelling to improve our structural understanding as well as the construction of the balanced sections. Those methods that have a direct impact on the results are discussed below.\n\n2.1\nSeismic interpretation and depth conversion\nSeismic reflection data was regionally interpreted both onshore and offshore. Offshore the regional \u201cPersian Carpet\u201d dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1) was the starting point for regional interpretation to constrain our subsurface model. The 2D seismic lines have a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02km grid spacing. Image quality in the shallow parts of these legacy seismic profiles is relatively good, but the deeper part of the data is commonly affected by random noise, multiples and sideswipes, making the interpretation difficult. Well-to-seismic ties (down to Permian levels) allowed the identification of the main stratigraphic horizons that were regionally mapped on the densely spaced offshore 2D seismic lines. The pre-Permian stratigraphy was interpreted based on seismic facies character where the seismic image quality allowed. The two-way travel time domain horizons were gridded into surfaces and depth converted with a regional velocity model (see below).\nThe onshore seismic data is composed of multiple vintage surveys and recorded only in selected areas with a wide spacing of lines (see Supplementary Fig. 1). The different surveys were recorded with variations in acquisition parameters and processed to various degree \u2013 hence the seismic quality is very uneven and generally has a much lower quality than that of the offshore data. Additionally, data quality significantly degrades also with depth. There are only few locations with well control to start reliable horizon interpretations. To link the seismic data to surface geology and measured dip data, the seismic images were depth converted prior to interpretation (see below). The subsequent interpretation was done in Move software (Move, 2018), using section construction tools and a stratigraphic template fitted for the individual sub-areas. For the interpretation of structural features, we deployed methods suggested in Shaw et al. (2005, and references therein).\n\n2.1.1\nVelocity models used\nFor the onshore and offshore areas velocity models were created. For the depth conversion of offshore seismic data and interpretations, we used a regional 3D velocity model generated from borehole constraints (check shot velocities and vertical seismic profile data) in conjunction with seismic processing velocities. The oldest formation penetrated by the offshore wells was the Permian aged Faraghan level (Fig. 2), consequently, the velocities below this level are poorly constrained. Seismic horizons which are depth converted with this velocity model still have misties at well locations of several tens of meters in the Cenozoic stratigraphy to max. \u00b1350\u00a0m (for Triassic and Permian surfaces). After well calibration, the velocity model produced seismic horizons without misties. However, the initial magnitude of error\/order of misties can be assumed to exist away from the areas with well control.\nDue to the lack of calibration data we depth converted onshore seismic lines with a simple velocity model. The model has a relatively high starting velocity at the surface (4500\u00a0m\/s) and a slow linear velocity increase with depth was applied (gradient -0.2). This model is considered as a compromise between young rocks in the synclines and older, faster rocks exposed at the surface, mainly in anticlines. High velocities in the deeper sections have been clipped to 6500\u00a0m\/s (approximately at 4\u00a0s TWT on the seismic sections). The parameters used have been chosen to match approximately the velocity trends extracted from onshore wells near the sections. The uncertainties of the onshore depth converted seismic sections are not quantified but can be assumed to be higher than from the offshore data. Due to the inherent uncertainties, the depth converted seismic data has not been used to interpret exact stratigraphic positions and thicknesses, but to constrain the bedding dip and structural features. Horizon surfaces were interpreted and created directly in depth and thus fit at well locations.\n\n\n\n2.2\nBalanced section construction\nThe main constraints for the construction of the balanced cross sections are:\n\na.\nSurface geological maps including bedding dip data.\n\n\nb.\nKnowledge and data acquired during 2 field work campaigns (including acquisition of bedding dip data).\n\n\nc.\nSeismic interpretation of onshore and offshore data.\n\n\nd.\nStratigraphic thicknesses from wells and outcrop data.\n\n\ne.\nIntegration of regional to local knowledge gained from published studies\n\n\n\nThe construction of the balanced sections follows the standard procedures of Woodward et al. (1987). For the restoration we use the line-length of the main competent horizons in combination with a stratigraphic template (see below). For incompetent formations some internal deformation has been considered (deviating locally from the stratigraphic thickness) but the area is approximately constant. This process allows for some degree of disharmonic folding. For the Hormuz salt more variations have been allowed as the mobile salt may have been expelled and eroded or squeezed in and out of the section.\nFor the construction of the sections, we used a stratigraphic template that includes thickness constraints from regional thickness maps which have been compiled from well and outcrop data (NIOC propriety data and own observations). An example of the stratigraphic thicknesses from the main wells along the sections is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.\nTo directly integrate the reflection seismic sections, the onshore and offshore seismic data was depth converted (see above) prior to interpretation.\nShortening from the balanced sections is calculated by L0-Ld with L0 being the restored section and Ld the deformed section length at the chosen stratigraphic level. The shortening ratio is also expressed in percent to enable the relative shortening of sections which are not on the same location or have the same length. To get meaningful relative shortening values all measurements need similarly placed pin and loose lines. The frontal pin should be at the deformation front, and the loose line in a part of the section without repeated section (e.g. syncline).\n\n\n2.3\nArea balancing\nFor assessing and discussing uncertainties related to the balanced cross sections we use an additional regional area balancing approach. The area balancing method is one of the oldest techniques used to compare deformed and restored state of a geological section. Initially it has been used by Chamberlain (1910) to estimate the depth to detachment but has since been used and further developed by others to estimate the amount of shortening (see Woodward et al., 1987 and references therein). In comparison to other balancing methods, area balancing does not give indications about the deformation path from undeformed to deformed sections, thus it is a kinematics-independent method. Judge and Allmendinger (2011) used area balancing as an analytical tool to assess the uncertainty level of balanced cross sections. The uncertainties related to the input parameters (like stratigraphic thickness, depth to d\u00e9collement, amount of hanging wall erosion) are propagated into an overall error on the magnitude of shortening. They use an enveloping polygon with attendant uncertainties to describe the area in the deformed and undeformed state. An increase in stratigraphic thickness can be considered by using different thicknesses on both sides of the wedge.\nWe use a different method to study the influence of (a) the stratigraphic thickness and (b) of a potential (variable) dip of the basement. The latter parameter could account for increasing stratigraphic thickness (a stratigraphic taper) and\/or a change of the dip due to tectonic movements when comparing deformed and restored state. Hanging wall erosion (and thus the location of the hanging wall ramp) is considered negligible for the Fars area as there are hardly any major thrusts in the study area.\nThe approach is used to show how variations of these two parameters would result in calculated shortening values. The Miocene Mishan Formation (Fig. 2) is used as top horizontal datum, as it was mainly deposited under marine conditions. The area between top Mishan Fm. and top basement is the deformed area Ad (Fig. 4\n). This area needs to equal the restored area A0 (Fig. 4).\nA range of variations of the determined input parameters (stratigraphic thicknesses measured at the deformation front and top basement dip) are used and the according shortening values calculated (i.e. L0 - Ld). In addition, a percentage of shortening is calculated to allow comparison to other results and sections. For the shortening calculation we split the area into geometrical areas and measure the folded area above a certain datum (i.e. Ada above Zda) and the deformed section length (Ld; Fig. 4). The other sub-areas (Adb, Adc) are geometrically calculated on defined variable parameters (i.e. dip of the basement (\u03b2), stratigraphic thickness at the deformation front Zda\u00a0+\u00a0Zdb). The length of the restored section (L0) is iteratively calculated with MS Excel goal seek function until A0 equals Ad; i.e.: (A0a\u00a0+\u00a0A0b\u00a0+\u00a0A0c) = (Ada\u00a0+\u00a0Adb\u00a0+\u00a0Adc).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nSeismic observations and interpretation results\nMuch of our understanding of the subsurface structure is dependent on seismic reflection imaging. The stratigraphic thickness and the salt structures south of the deformation front give an impression on how parts of the fold belt may have looked before being deformed, although regional differences may exist. Onshore seismic reflection data define subsurface structures not obvious at the surface, which need to be included in the balanced sections. Therefore, we provide here some examples of the results from seismic interpretation relevant for the construction of the balanced sections and the discussion of uncertainties.\n\nFig. 5\na shows an example of an interpreted seismic line south of the deformation front between the two sections of this study. This line has a better data quality than most of the lines available for the study. The interpreted horizons from surface to the Permian Top Faraghan Formation are well imaged and tied to borehole data in the area. In the lower part of the section the imaging quality is impaired by multiples, out-of-plane reflections, random noise and possibly velocity inversions. Therefore, the interpretation of the remaining, undrilled Palaeozoic sequence below as well as the top of the salt (of the source layer and of the diapirs) and the top basement\/top pre-salt is problematic (Fig. 5a).\nThe interpretation shows slightly thinning and uplifted stratigraphy in the SW of the section (Fig. 5a, Point 1) which is interpreted to relate to a buried diapir at depth. The shape and top of the diapir is not detectable on the seismic data, with continuous reflectors in the Permian level indicating that the diapir is buried below. An unconformity is detectable in the Paleozoic sequence (Fig. 5a, Point 2), which is interpreted as the Hercynian unconformity. The apparent salt pillow shape in the northern part of the section is constrained by dipping reflectors (Fig. 5a, Point 3) and is interpreted as a result of the position of the seismic profile across the flank of a diapir (see island SE of the section on Fig. 1). The Top Salt and Basement interpretations are difficult to assess in this data. While it may be possible to interpret seismic horizons, unconformities and features related to the stratigraphic and halokinetic history on this or on other seismic lines, it is very challenging to interpret such features consistently in the network of 2D seismic lines. Individual seismic interpreters easily map different solutions demonstrating that there is an interpretational uncertainty on such kind of data. For the assessment and discussion of the interpretational uncertainty (Section 3.3) two versions have been added tentatively (see discussion). The difference between the two versions at the level of the Hormuz salt is in the order of 1\u20131.5\u00a0s TWT.\nThe second example of offshore seismic data shows a 2D seismic line that passes laterally of an emergent diapir (Fig. 5b). Tilted reflectors in the uppermost part of the section (Fig. 5b, Point 1) indicate halokinetic deformation. The deeper geometry of the diapir flank cannot be defined well on the seismic data (Fig. 5b, Point 2). In the centre of the section the image shows a synform with stratigraphic growth especially for pre-Cenozoic part of the section (Fig. 5b, Point 3). Around point 4, strong reflectors and contradicting dips in the section are likely an effect of sideswipes from another large diapir to the NW of the line. Dipping reflectors at Points 5 and 6 indicate that the synform is also present at greater depth. The setting is interpreted as basement depression related to the Proterozoic-Early Cambrian extension, filled with high thicknesses of Hormuz salt, which later flowed into the diapirs nearby.\nThe onshore interpretations were done on depth converted seismic data to allow the geometrical integration of surface geological data. Fig. 6\na shows an example of 2D seismic interpretation using a section that crosses Band-e Lengeh anticline perpendicular to the strike of the fold axis. This section has been selected as it is one of the few lines with relatively good seismic imaging and some clear indications for the internal deformation in the anticline.\nQuickly changing dips and reflector terminations constrain the presence of a thrust fault in the center of the fold (Fig. 6a, Point 1). The fold started apparently as a fault-propagation fold, as the displacements along the thrust plane decrease into younger stratigraphic levels. Some additional folding may be post thrusting as the thrust seems slightly folded as well. The seismic line also shows oppositely dipping reflections below the thrust at points 2 and 3. A potential fault-plane reflection causing this deformation is imaged at point 4. Based on the seismic image and the stratigraphic control by thickness constraints the higher thrust is linking Dashtak with Asmari\/Jahrum\/Pabdeh level (Fig. 2), thus two very incompetent levels (Asmari\/Jahrum in this southern area is dominated by anhydritic rocks transitioning into the Fars salt to the South and carbonate facies towards the North and West). The Gachsaran Formation has also evaporitic layers, which in other parts of Band-e Lengeh led to the disassembly of the layers on top of the elevated anticline by glide tectonics.\nAnother example of an onshore seismic section revealing deformation inside an anticline is shown in Fig. 6b. Surface geology and the shallower part of the 2D seismic line constrain the shape of the western Shamilu anticline on this section. Reflector terminations of the footwall and the synclinal folding of the reflectors in the hanging wall at point 1 indicate the presence of a thrust fault (Fig. 6a, Point 1). Shamilu anticline is interpreted here as an anticline formed above a potential pop-up structure. Additional internal small-scale deformation is necessary in the fold hinge area. This deeper interpretation is constrained by the dip of stronger reflectors and potential fault plane reflections (e.g. Fig. 6a, Points 2, 3) as well as stratigraphic thicknesses. However, the seismic image quality is poor in the deeper part and thus provides only a weak constrain. Other possible solutions are shown in Fig. 6c and d. In 6c, the internal deformation is interpreted with additional brittle faults, while in Fig. 6d just folding and ductile deformation is shown. It is obvious, that there is room for additional interpretations.\nAfter depth conversion, the results of the onshore and offshore mapping were combined in the depth domain. Fig. 7\n illustrates the Upper Permian Dehram Group horizon mapped both offshore and onshore.\nThe offshore Permian horizon (Top Faraghan) shows a rounded elevated surface indicating folds arching above buried diapirs. Additionally, a few diapirs pierce this Permian mapping surface. Apart from these features the surface shows only a few obvious features related to young contraction. There is a gradual increase in depth from west to east. Close to the coast, the Top Faraghan is located at depth of approx. -5000 to -7000\u00a0m (Fig. 7).\nThe onshore surface represents approximately the top of the Upper Permian\/lower Triassic Kangan formation. It has been gridded from the interpretations and constructions done with Move software on the depth converted onshore seismic lines. To create a regional grid, a relatively large gridding size has been used (500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0500m) to define the large-scale structure. Details, like multi-Z values from overthrust parts are unfortunately lost at this scale and individual structural features are best documented in detailed sections. The anticlines visible on this level are usually sub-parallel to the anticlines visible at the surface level, but some degree of disharmonic folding exists. Depth values range from approx. -9500 to 0\u00a0m above sea level (Fig. 7). However, due to the simplicity of the velocity model used, the values need to be taken with care.\n\n\n3.2\nField work examples\nFor the construction of regional sections we mainly used 1:100\u00a0000 scale geological maps and bedding plane structural measurements. In our two field campaigns we focused on regional to local structural-stratigraphic relationships. Furthermore, deformation features, not resolved on the geological maps were identified. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows three examples of intraformational shortening that has been observed. Such features demonstrate that there is shortening present that may lead to intraformational thickening and may be only observed under certain outcrop conditions.\n\n\n3.3\nBalanced sections\nWe constructed for the study area two balanced and restored sections (Fig. 8\n), located in the eastern and western parts of the study area (Fig. 1 for locations).\n\n3.3.1\nWestern section (section A)\nThe western section was constructed after the first year of the study when seismic interpretation in other areas was still ongoing. Therefore, it may not contain the structural complexity that we saw in other seismic lines. The three seismic sections north of the deformation front have less quality than the examples shown in Fig. 6 and hardly constrain the deeper structure. The stratigraphic thickness determined at the deformation front (13800\u00a0m) is the interpretation result of the depth converted offshore seismic section just south of the deformation front (background image in Fig. 8a). Most of the formations thicken slightly towards the north as indicated by well data (cf. Supplementary Fig. 3) and propriety NIOC thickness maps. For the diapir suspected underneath Gavbast, the age of burial is unknown. We interpret that in addition to folding squeezing of the diapir and buoyancy forces and differential compaction enhances the (circular) uplift of horizons above regional elevation. This behaviour is also evident south of the deformation front where the offshore diapirs are buried underneath Permian strata and uplifting their roofs (see Figs. 5a and 7). The overall anticipated result of the young Cenozoic shortening is that of a halokinetic pre-deformed stratigraphic cover, that is detached on the basal Hormuz salt layer and shows mainly detachment folding. Details of deformation within the anticlines are not resolved in the section.\nThe diapir at Parak in the north of the section (Fig. 8b, stippled, as slightly out-of section) is interpreted not to be buried but growing (mainly in passive growth mode) until the Cenozoic shortening. This may be the result of an originally thicker or more continuous salt source layer close to the Parak diapir. Salt remnants interbedded in the younger Miocene formations (Aga Yari and Bakthiari Fms) south of the diapir (observed in outcrops) is interpreted as result of squeezing the diapir and extrusion of salt in the Late Miocene to Pliocene with the onset of the contraction. Major thrusts have not been observed in the field, but some small-scale reverse faulting is observed in outcrop (e.g. at Gavbast dome) or constrained from seismic or section construction (southern limb of Denow anticline). Slight basement inversion movements have been assumed (average basement dip deformed: 1.0\u00b0, restored: 1.14\u00b0). We consider that anticipated inversion of basement steps partly controls the progressive foreland propagation of folding by partly restoring the thin, partly welded out, salt layer to a smoother d\u00e9collement horizon. The restored section uses the top Miocene Mishan Fm. as horizontal datum. The restored line-length of Top Mishan (168284\u00a0m) compared to the deformed section length (155560\u00a0m) reveals 12724\u00a0m or 7.6% of shortening (Table 2\n). An additional version of Top Mishan interpretation (Fig. 8a, deformed section, dotted green line) is shortcutting synclines and eroded anticlines slightly and thus reflects an estimate for the minimum line-length necessary (165435\u00a0m), corresponding to 6% of shortening (Table 2).\n\n\n3.3.2\nEastern section (section B)\nThe eastern section was constructed close to the end of the study with most learnings from regional assessments involved. Stratigraphic thickness at the deformation front is 11500\u00a0m and more detailed thickness variations based on well and regional trend data are included in the sections. The cross-section has better onshore seismic control than the western section, with images allowing to interpret shortening structures inside anticlines. Some thrusting in Shamilu - Harmadan anticline area is constrained by seismic data as well as from outcrop observations. Anticlines are generally considered to represent detachment folds (those striking approx. W-E, Fig. 1), but some folds interfere with that pattern and strike WSW-ENE to SW-NE. These folds are interpreted to be controlled by an inherited pre-shortening architecture. We consider that primary salt thickness is higher in Proterozoic-Early Cambrian graben areas with the ENE-WSW orientation. Halokinetic down-building since the Paleozoic increased the post-salt stratigraphic thicknesses especially in these graben areas. During N\u2013S shortening these thicker packages are inverted and folded dominantly in a thin-skinned manner. Other folds with ENE-WSW orientation may in contrast be located along salt walls and have partly highly variable post-salt stratigraphic thicknesses. The Bostaneh fold for example has a reduced thickness in the Cretaceous, including the absence of the Bangestan Group, but greater thickness in the Jurassic (see also Supplementary Fig. 3, Well G) indicating some vertical movements interpreted to relate to salt movements in the salt wall or salt pillow below. The inherited WSW-ENE to SW-NE direction is obliquely interfering with the W-E folding direction leading to the complicated pattern of fold trends as observed in the eastern part of the study area (Fig. 1). Most diapirs in the eastern part of the study area are considered to have been at or close to the surface throughout most of the Paleozoic to Cenozoic history. The diapir in the Shu anticline is potentially an exception and could, like Gavbast, represent a buried diapir that lifted its roof in the contraction, subsequent erosion possibly enabled diapiric piercing - but no outcrop studies have been conducted to investigate the halokinetic strata at the contacts and confirm the assumption. Bam diapir (Fig. 8b) shows a triangular, sheet like salt extrusion on the map (Fig. 1). This is interpreted to be the result of squeezing of a pre-existing diapir with additional minor thrusting observable on the map. The diapir likely has a secondary weld somewhere at depth. The horizontal displacement in the Triassic layers is a result from slightly higher line length shortening above this level and could indicate that some horizontal strain partitioning is ongoing on the Dashtak detachment. Like in the western section, some of the pre-Palaeozoic faults in the basement are also considered to show slight inversion, which may influence the propagation of the deformation towards the foreland. The pre-kinematic restored section has an average dip towards the hinterland of 0.46\u00b0 (Top Miocene Mishan Fm.) and 0.6\u00b0 at top basement level. Pure line-length balancing of Top Mishan reveals 28860\u00a0m or 14.7% of shortening (Table 2). Also, for this section, a smoother Top Mishan version has been constructed to constrain the line-length minimum shortening. The dotted green line in the deformed section of Fig. 8b has a length of 181288\u00a0m, corresponding to 7.5% of shortening.\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nOur balanced sections show 7.6\u201314.7% of shortening and indicate minor inversion on some normal faults. In the first part of the discussion, we will focus on the impact of uncertainty related variations in the initial constraints and how much these could change the results. In the second part we will discuss other indications that can be used to infer basement contribution to the deformation of the cover rocks.\n\n4.1\nAssessing uncertainties of the balanced sections\nThe stratigraphic thickness is a major factor influencing the balancing outcome (Judge and Allmendinger, 2011). Consequently, we will first analyse the uncertainties with respect to the stratigraphic thickness, followed by an area balancing approach investigating how different stratigraphic thicknesses would impact the calculated shortening. As there is also an uncertainty regarding the dip of the basal d\u00e9collement, we will also take this into consideration.\n\n4.1.1\nStratigraphic thickness uncertainty\nIn our balanced section we used a stratigraphic thickness of 13800\u00a0m and 11500\u00a0m respectively which were derived from single interpretations of depth converted seismic sections close to the deformation front (Table 2).\n\nMolinaro et al. (2005) use a thickness of 4000\u20135000\u00a0m for the Cambrian to Lower Miocene sequence, without giving a source for these values. Alavi (2007) compiled a very detailed table of stratigraphic thicknesses he used for the construction of his sections. For his section F (partly redrafted in Fig. 3a) he states a stratigraphic thickness below the Permian Faraghan Formation of only 700\u00a0m (lower Permian to Cambrian)\u00a0+\u00a01000\u00a0m estimated Hormuz salt. Both papers use low stratigraphic thicknesses and produce high shortening ratios (Table 1). Unfortunately, it is not possible to discuss the plausibility of the thickness assumptions, as it is not clear where they originated from (data and\/or interpretation, source).\n\nJahani et al. (2009) based their balanced section on depth converted seismic interpretations. For the lower Paleozoic seismic horizons they used an average velocity of 4500\u00a0m\/s and achieve 6\u00a0km (locally up to 8\u00a0km) lower Paleozoic strata thickness, younger sediments are 5\u20138\u00a0km thick (Jahani et al., 2009). Based on that their values the total sedimentary thickness range above the Hormuz salt is 11\u201315\u00a0km. Interestingly, Jahani et al. (2017) show a dip cross section (WNW-ESE) which intersects Section A of Jahani et al., (2009) with a significant different stratigraphic thickness. The balanced section of Jahani et al. (2009) shows about 13\u00a0km stratigraphic thickness in the syncline next to Gavbast dome, while the geological section published in 2017 shows the top of the basement at depth exceeding 17\u00a0km. Although the section is not claimed to be balanced, the difference highlights very well the amount of uncertainty related to the inferred stratigraphic thickness (including the salt) and the top basement depth estimates.\nThe stratigraphic thicknesses down to Permian levels used in our sections are constrained by well data from NIOC. As discussed earlier, the deeper Paleozoic section has a combined interpretational and depth conversion uncertainty. Fig. 9\n illustrates the potential thickness range for the Paleozoic rocks as a function of different average interval velocities between 4500 and 6000\u00a0m\/s (strongly compacted, dominantly clastic rocks). Utilising these variations in interval velocities, the alternative top basement interpretations at the deformation front (Fig. 5a; approx. 6\u20136.9\u00a0s TWT) lead to a Paleozoic thickness (Top Faraghan horizon to top pre-salt) in the order of 6000\u201311000\u00a0m. These thickness values likely mark the extremes. The two basement picks reflect the ranges of interpretations we received from geoscientists working on the study and thus can be considered as possible. For the velocities a brief look at the stratigraphy is required. The inferred deeper Paleozoic stratigraphy is composed of highly compacted, deeply buried clastic sediments and dolomites (Fig. 2). To achieve an interval velocity of 4500\u00a0m\/s a dominance of clastic rocks with remaining porosity plus some amounts of halite (approx. 4050\u00a0m\/s) is required. The upper bound 6000\u00a0m\/s velocity could be achieved from deeply buried, fully compacted, cemented clastic rocks and dolomites with hardly any remaining porosities. Welded out or thinned salt pedestal would have little influence on the interval velocity in the latter case. Nevertheless, the deeper Paleozoic rocks in the area as well as the pre-salt basement have not been drilled and depth estimates from other methods (gravity inversion etc.) are not giving more reliable estimates either (e.g. Hinsch et al., 2020). Trocm\u00e9 et al. (2011) generated a 3D depth model in the southern Fars onshore area. They faced similar problems with poor seismic image quality in the anticlines. In their model they assume a velocity of 4600\u00a0m\/s for the lower Paleozoic, without giving any further information on their assumption, but they state that the onshore velocity model is highly uncertain\/debated.\nThe thickness of Top Mishan (Miocene) to Top Faraghan (Permian) is interpreted to be 5000\u00a0m at the deformation front in Fig. 5a (based on conversion with regional well calibrated velocity model). Consequently, the total stratigraphic thickness from Top Mishan to top pre-salt is in the range of 11000-16000\u00a0m for the line shown. The same high and low range estimation can be applied to the time domain seismic sections that had been the basis for the balanced sections in Fig. 8 (Table 3\n). For the section in Fig. 8a this would result in a stratigraphic thickness between 10675-16660\u00a0m and for the section in Fig. 8b 9500\u201315620\u00a0m. An additional error in the order of about \u00b1350m for the depth conversion of the pre-Palaeozoic strata also needs to be considered.\nGiven the thicknesses from seismic interpretation results shown in Jahani et al. (2009, 2017) as well as those from our study, we suggest that the minimum and maximum stratigraphic thickness involved in the southern Fars thin-skinned deformation is about 9.5 and 16.5\u00a0km respectively (top pre-salt to top Mishan), with potentially strong local variation due to halokinetic growth throughout the Phanerozoic.\n\n\n4.1.2\nArea balancing\nThe balanced sections in Fig. 8 show how single realisations could look like for the two transects.\nThe area balancing approach highlights how shortening estimates may vary as a function of stratigraphic thickness and slight variations of the top basement dip. While a constant dip can be attributed to a stratigraphic taper, the rationale for varying the dip from deformed to restored section is this:\n\n\u2022\nDecreasing \u03b2 (\u03b2d\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b20): the finite inclination of basement is steeper than in the restored section. Such a case could be achieved by flexure of the lower plate post-dating the deposition of the horizontal datum (i.e. Mishan Fm.). In this case, shortening value outcomes are higher in comparison to a constant \u03b2.\n\n\n\u2022\nIncreasing \u03b2 (\u03b2d\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b20): can be considered as the result of basement shortening. Thick-skinned reverse faults uplift basement rocks above regional elevation and decrease the average basement dip. Consequently, less shortening is required in the sediments in comparison to a constant \u03b2.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 10\n shows the resulting shortening in relation to stratigraphic thickness and variations of basement dip from a deformed section (\u03b2d\u00a0=\u00a01\u00b0) to restored section. Other combinations of \u03b2d and \u03b20 are available in the Supplementary Table 1.\nThe results of the area balancing models demonstrate that a thinner sedimentary cover needs to be shortened more to support the observed structural elevations of the anticlines than a thicker cover. Changing the basement dip has a similar effect on shortening as more internal deformation of the same stratigraphic package would be required if the basement is flexed. The opposite is true if thick-skinned deformation contributes to the cross-sectional area above the former regional elevation of the top basement.\nAs described earlier, values for the present basal dip of the detachment can be estimated from different methods and results may vary from 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 from the foreland towards the suture. Therefore, we need to account for the uncertainty in the basal dip for the regional sections. Fig. 10 shows that a very small error may result in a significant change in relative shortening. For example, if we consider a 13000\u00a0m thick stratigraphic package, the surface trace of the western section (Fig. 8a), a basal d\u00e9collement of \u03b2d\u00a0=\u00a01\u00b0 and a restored section with a \u00b10.5\u00b0 difference (\u0394\u03b2) the resulting relative shortening is in the range from 5.2 to 13.7% (Fig. 10a, Supplementary Table 1). If we increase \u0394\u03b2 to\u00a0\u00b11\u00b0 the range is 1.4\u201318.8%.\n\n\n\n4.2\nBalancing mismatches and multilayer deformation\nFor the example above, the lower ranges of relative shortening are already below the minimum (green dotted line in Fig. 8a, see also Table 2), and thus can be ruled out. The upper range values result from a variation of basement dip, where the deformed section has a slightly higher dip than the undeformed section. The shortening from area balancing on these examples may exceed the line-length measurement along a key bed. Such cases are only plausible if a reasonable explanation for the line-length mismatch is provided.\nA possible explanation for shortening that is unrecognized or unresolved on a regional section, includes layer parallel shortening (LPS) and mesoscale shortening structures (e.g. Mitra, 1994). Yonkee and Weil (2010) estimated that within the central Sevier thrust system, LPS magnitudes vary from <5%, where cleavage is absent, to 10%\u201330% in the more interior part system, where cleavage intensity is moderate to strong. For the salt detached rocks in the Southern Pyrenees Sans et al. (2003) estimated 16\u201323% of layer parallel shortening, based on strain analysis, that need to be added to the restored section line-length.\nSimilarly, small macroscopic to mesoscale deformation structures may not be resolved on a regional section. Such structures may be partly exposed (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 2) or resolved in seismic (Fig. 6b and c) but the overall quantification is hampered by outcrop and data conditions along the section, respectively. Folding accommodation faults can be expected, caused by an increase in bed curvature within fold cores (Mitra, 2002). Consequently, the older stratigraphy will deform in the core of anticlines and the younger stratigraphy will be more affected by deformation in the synclines. In the Zagros, the synclines are usually covered by thick (young) sediments and the anticlines are often not deeply eroded to expose the secondary or mesoscale faults. Therefore, a lot of smaller scale deformation may remain unrecognized.\nOur two sections provide good examples as they have a different shortening ratio based on line-length (Table 2). As discussed, the data quality for Section A is worse than for Section B and the shortening is much lower. We believe that it would be possible to redraw Section A and have the same shortening as Section B (Fig. 8). Internal shortening, as indicated in Section B and in the seismic lines nearby (Fig. 6), shows deformation as the result of multiple detachment horizons in the stratigraphic succession. Such features have not been observed on the poorer quality seismic of section A, but it seems likely that such deformation is present there as well.\nDeformation related to multi-detachment shortening is a common observation in the whole Zagros, also in areas where no Hormuz salt is present (e.g. Verg\u00e9s et al., 2011; Sherkati et al., 2005; Najafi et al., 2014; Ghanadian et al., 2017; Koyi and Mansurbeg, 2021). In some cases, the shallower detachments are related to folds of smaller wavelength than the large-scale anticlines detaching at the basal d\u00e9collement (e.g. Koyi and Mansurbeg, 2021). In other cases, internal deformation in the large-scale anticline is suggested or observed (e.g. Verg\u00e9s et al., 2011; Ghanadian et al., 2017) and may lead to some degree of disharmonic folding. The presence of multiple detachments in the stratigraphic column which are linked by secondary or mesoscale faults increase the chance that deformation is not fully captured or quantified on regional sections. When not considered, disharmonic folding and unresolved micro-to mesoscale deformation adds to the uncertainty of balanced sections and may explain mismatches between area balancing and line-length estimates. Therefore, we would consider that the realistic shortening of our sections is above our line-length estimate. For estimating a realistic upper bound of shortening more fieldwork and deformation analysis is necessary.\n\n\n4.3\nBasement influence on deformation\nOur balanced sections were drawn based on the hypothesis that an extensional fabric from the time of Hormuz salt deposition is present below the basal d\u00e9collement. We consider that the syn-depositional extension would control the primary salt distribution and thicknesses. These differences would subsequently influence the halokinetic evolution and younger deformation. In the following we discuss this conceptual model which we built into our sections in agreement with our observations and other studies.\nMost studies that attributed thick-skinned deformation to the simply folded belt in the Fars based their arguments on older seismicity studies, locating earthquakes at depths attributed to basement or considered a thinner sedimentary cover (e.g. Berberian, 1995; Talebian and Jackson, 2004; Alavi 2007; Molinaro et al., 2005). Alignments of faults in the Fars with the \u201cArabian\u201d orientation were interpreted as indication for the reactivation of basement faults (e.g. Talbot and Alavi, 1996; Berberian, 1995. Hessami et al., 2001b). However, Jahani et al. (2017) demonstrated that some diapir alignment along N\u2013S trending strike slip fault systems NW of the Fars Arch\/Gavbandi High (NW of our Study area) are thin-skinned tear faults. These faults are likely in alignment with late Proterozoic early Cambrian extensional faults due to their control on original salt distribution and subsequent sedimentation. Structurally controlled initial salt distribution is also evident on the other side of the basin in Saudi Arabia (Stewart, 2017). Fig. 5b clearly indicates that basement lows are also present in the southern Fars area and that the subsequent halokinetic evolution enhanced thickness variations in the stratigraphy. On that section, a diapir is still exposed at the surface displaying passive halokinetic growth (sensu Rowan and Giles, 2021; Hudec and Jackson, 2007). However, many offshore salt structures are small circular features (Figs. 7 and 8a) which most likely represent diapirs which are covered by sediments (\u201cnon-piercing\u201d in Perotti et al., 2016). As most passively growing diapirs evolve until the source layer is largely exhausted (Jackson and Hudec, 2017), we suggest that the circular buried diapirs indicate areas where the salt source layer was nearly depleted so that sedimentation could outpace salt flow in passive mode diapirism. Therefore, we interpret areas with mainly buried diapirs as having a thinner original Hormuz salt (or disconnected layer), while areas with continued passive growing diapirs likely had a thicker salt source layer, deposited in structural lows during the formation of the Hormuz salt sequence (cf. Jahani et al., 2017; Callot et al., 2012; Stewart, 2017). Although it is possibly an oversimplification, the various diapirs in the Fars may have more complex histories and are partly rejuvenated and squeezed (cf. Snidero et al., 2019; Jahani et al., 2007), we suggest that the map-view and cross-sectional diapir pattern give some indirect indications about the structuration at their base level. The Gavbast dome and possibly the Shu diapir (Fig. 11\n) are interpreted as buried diapirs located in an area north of the deformation front were most of the diapirs were at\/close to surface prior to contraction. This heterogenous presence of long-lasting passive and buried diapirs is an indirect indication of a structured basement north of the deformation front as depicted in our balanced cross sections. The structured basement at d\u00e9collement level with heterogenous stratigraphic thicknesses in the detached cover led to the complex folding pattern that we see today (Figs. 1 and 11). The influence of pre-existing diapirs on folding and thrusting has already been investigated in detail with analogue models (Callot et al., 2012; Santolaria et al., 2021a, b). These analogue models use various distribution of silicone shapes representing diapirs and salt walls above a flat substratum with silicone material as a basal d\u00e9collement. The interaction of diapirs, salt walls, and the mini-basins in-between, play a fundamental role on how the deformation localizes and the frontal fold belt wedge builds up. Results from folding experiments with numerical models in which pre-existing diapirs are present, show that the diapirs hardly influence the dominant wavelength but speed up the folding instability and thus affecting the folding pattern (Fernandez and Kaus, 2014). To our knowledge, the influence of the local paleo-morphology at the base of the d\u00e9collement level has not been systematically investigated. Several folds in the eastern part of our study area, including the Shu and Bostaneh anticline have a WSW-ENE folding trend (Fig. 11a), oblique to the main striking fold trend which is roughly parallel to the ZDF (mostly WNW-ESE to W-E, Fig. 11a). Some diapirs may also align in this suspected WSW-ENE inherited trend (e.g. at SW and NE of Bostaneh anticline), but this is considered more conjectural.\nThere are several possibilities on how such a suspected inherited orientation could manifest itself in the fold direction. The sketches in Fig. 11b\u2013d shows some end members. Salt evacuation in a structurally formed basement low results in a thicker stratigraphic accumulation (Fig. 11b). Fig. 11c shows an anticline that forms by inversion of the former normal fault, while Fig. 11d shows a thin-skinned solution. Both solutions have their problems. For example, the thick-skinned inversion solution does not produce significant line-length shortening in the cover at the front of the anticline to cause major additional folds above the detachment (for an in-sequence deformation). An out-of-sequence thick-skinned inversion will very likely cut the d\u00e9collement and prevent further thin-skinned folding towards the deformation front. The thin-skinned solution will translate the former mini-basin onto the half graben shoulder, but the detachment needs to climb the step at the basement level. The translation onto the high will reverse the half graben\/mini-basin fill, similar to a turtle anticline (which is stationary and forms just by halokinesis). Additionally, folding as well as squeezing of a potential diapir and salt wall, may add to the deformation (cf. Snidero et al., 2019; Santolaria et al., 2021a, b; Hassanpour et al., 2021). The thin-skinned and thick-skinned solutions may reflect end members, but both may produce anticlines in strike direction of the suspected inherited basement fabric. While the situation in Fig. 11c reflects active influence of the basement, the situation portrayed in Fig. 11b is that of a passive control. Given that some limited seismicity is present beneath the d\u00e9collement (Nissen et al., 2011, 2014) some minor inversion may occur and result in a mixed mode. Such a situation is drafted in the sections (Fig. 8), which show some mild inversion. However, the amount of this basement deformations remains speculative, and the section could be constructed without it as well. From a balancing point of view, it does not seem possible to define if basement is actively or passively contributing to the cross-sectional area. Other methods may give clues about this questionable basement contribution.\nA numerical modelling study by Nilfouroushan et al. (2013) indicated that their cold geotherm models better mimic the structure of the Zagros simply folded belt. In these models the cover deforms by thin-skinned deformation ahead of the basement reactivation (also of pre-existing faults), which occurs to the hinterland and produces significant uplift. The taper models by Mouthereau et al. (2006) suggest that a thick salt layer may not support the observed topography. Instead, these authors propose a ductile layer in the basement. However, as proposed in this and other studies (e.g. Jahani et al., 2017; Snidero et al., 2019) the salt in the source layer is most likely not a thick layer at present and at least partly welded out. Thus, the observed morphology may well be supported by thin\/welded salt and a structured basement.\n\n\n4.4\nOutlook\nThe analysis and discussion of the main uncertainties should always accompany the presentation of a balanced section and we suggest that it becomes a standard for future studies involving regional structural balancing. For example, what is the source of the assumed stratigraphic thicknesses (seismic and\/or outcrop) and how uncertain are these measurements?\n\nAllmendinger and Judge (2013) discuss the stratigraphic thicknesses uncertainties gained from map measurements. In our study we show the large uncertainty related to stratigraphy thickness from seismic interpretation with an incomplete and inconclusive dataset (moderate to poor seismic definition, missing or poorly constrained seismic velocities).\nWe also propose that the stratigraphic taper and possible changes of the basement dip should be discussed along with any balanced section, as they represent main uncertainties. Allmendinger and Judge (2013) show how a non-constant initial stratigraphic taper is impacting shortening values for two sections in the North American Cordillera. In our approach we visualize the uncertainty of stratigraphic thickness and basement dip on the shortening and its potential relation to basement deformation (stratigraphic taper and variations from deformed to restored section, Fig. 10).\n\nButler et al. (2018) suggest multiple solutions instead of producing single deterministic geometries. This may be a reasonable approach especially for the purpose of a subsurface drilling prospect. An example is given in Witte and Oncken (2020). These authors produce multiple solutions by forward modelling and minimize the uncertainty by systematically varying parameters in their workflow. For a regional balanced section, however, we would expect that few will make the actual effort to generate multiple realisations. Therefore, discussing the uncertainties and apply area balancing methods as proposed by Judge and Allmendinger (2011) or as in this study allows the scientific community to better judge the quality of the shortening value estimates and the conclusions drawn from the balanced section.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nVarious balanced sections have been published for the southern Fars area in the Iranian Zagros. The documented shortening ratios are in the range from 6% to 22% (approx.). The sections use strongly variable stratigraphic thicknesses involved in the thin-skinned deformation (5.5\u201314.5\u00a0km), thus highlighting large uncertainties in the balanced section and the associated shortening estimates.\nWe present two balanced sections through the southern Fars area, which vary in shortening ratio (7.6% for the western section and 14.7% for the eastern section, with a minimum estimate of 6% and 7.5% respectively). The difference is likely not related to significant structural differences but rather to the input data quality and associated uncertainties as well such as of knowledge and assumptions taken while constructing the two sections.\nThe stratigraphic thicknesses gained by seismic interpretation have considerable uncertainty and the unavoidable depth conversion also comes with an uncertainty. It is mainly due to the lack of data regarding the Paleozoic rocks. Considering various seismic velocities and various interpretations of the deeper sections we conclude that the stratigraphic thickness (Base Hormuz to Top Mishan) in the sections should be approximately between c. 9.5 and 16.5\u00a0km with local variations due to halokinetic processes. We consider that published balanced sections which are (mainly) using stratigraphic thickness below these values are likely overestimating the shortening. In addition, these sections are forced to introduce hard-linked thick-skinned deformation to fill the cross-sectional area above the former regional elevation of the detachment horizon.\nWe further analysed the influence of the uncertain input parameters with an area balancing approach. Apart from stratigraphic thickness, the dip of the basal d\u00e9collement can also be considered as a main uncertainty. A thinner stratigraphy results in higher shortening ratios and would require more internal deformation in the subsurface to fill the required cross section area. A section with a hinterland-dipping basal angle from flexure also requires more shortening than a horizontal section. Thick-skinned inversion would lower the amount of shortening in the decoupled sediments above the basement. Flexure and inversion have an opposite effect on the shortening ratio but could occur at the same time and potentially equalise each other\u2019 effects.\nBased on the uncertainties of these main parameters we believe that through balancing techniques it is nearly impossible to determine if and how much basement has contributed to the deformation in the southern Fars area. Furthermore, shortening estimates from our and published sections have a high level of uncertainty, which should be spelt out when those values are used for subsequent calculations, like geological strain rates.\nMost published interpretations imply active contribution of basement faults to the present deformation pattern in the Fars. However, major structural steps that uplift regional elevation, which can be related to thick-skinned involvement are not clearly identifiable in the study area. Our own anticipated structural model includes some mild inversion but given the uncertainties for the construction of balanced sections, it would be possible to draw the sections without young thick-skinned reverse faulting as well.\nThe present-day map in the southern Fars shows some mixed fold trends with a dominant W-E fold direction, which is related to the approx. N\u2013S shortening. Various other directions and interferences are explained by a strongly heterogenous cover with diapirs and salt walls developed in various degrees since the early Paleozoic. Some small to major folds strike in a SW-NE\/WSW-ENE direction. This direction is interpreted to represent an inherited (likely extensional) top basement morphology from the time of Hormuz deposition that subsequently controlled the coupled halokinetic stratigraphic evolution.\nIt remains uncertain if these suspected basement faults are active and inverting or if the present pattern is related to pure thin-skinned deformation and reversing of the strongly heterogenous stratigraphic cover with oblique trends. Thick stratigraphic packages are considered to have accumulated in salt evacuation basins in basement lows (e.g. half grabens) and are now translated southward, partly unfolding themselves and interfering with the dominant approx. E-W trending folding direction.\nIt was not the purpose of this paper to reduce the uncertainties, but to highlight their potential impact. Therefore, publishing single realisations of balanced section without discussion of the associated uncertainties seems questionable. For us, it was out of scope to construct multiple solutions for balanced sections. But we accompany our single solution with a transparent assessment and discussion of the uncertainties to allow the reader to judge the quality of the results and enable modifications when more data or knowledge becomes available. We hope that subsequent publications addressing the deformation in the southern Fars will also assess and discuss uncertainty levels in a similar manner.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nRalph Hinsch: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Visualisation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Martin V\u00f6gele: Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Visualisation, Writing - Review & Editing, Gholomreza Gharabeigli: Project administration, Investigation, Writing - Review & Editing, Bernhard Bretis: Investigation, Visualisation, Writing - Review & Editing, Gabor Tari: Writing - Review & Editing.\n\n","2":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Cretaceous Eagle Ford Formation and laterally equivalent Boquillas Formation in south Texas, USA \u2013 a mechanically layered basinal deposit dominated by organic-rich mudrock with interlayered chalk, limestone, and volcanic ash (Lehrmann et al., 2019) \u2013 were deposited on the northwestern edge of the Gulf of Mexico basin near the transition to the western interior seaway (Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Donovan et al., 2012; Ferrill et al., 2014b). Across south Texas, the Cretaceous section experienced widespread extensional deformation (faulting and fracturing) during Cenozoic extension southeastward toward the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Foley, 1926; Weeks, 1945; Ferrill and Morris, 2008; Treadgold et al., 2010). In addition, the western portion of this region exhibits uplift and folding associated with Laramide tectonism (Rose, 1984; Scott, 2010; Ewing, 2016). In this study, we analyze outcrops of the Boquillas Formation where it outcrops in west Texas, to characterize deformation styles near the frontal limit of macroscale Laramide contractional deformation.\nThe focus of this study is a series of roadcut exposures along Highway 90, northwest of Del Rio, Texas (Fig. 1\n). Fold trains in the Boquillas Formation are exposed over a highway distance of 2.5\u00a0km, where more than 100 open to tight anticlines are observed on both sides of the highway. The outcrops have for decades been popular field trip stops as part of geological society meetings and student field trips (e.g., Southern Association of Student Geological Societies, 1990; Willett, 1990; Lock et al., 2010), and featured in or subject of published articles (Johnston, 1983; Lock et al., 2001). These folds have been typically referred to as \u2018tepee structures\u2019, and variously interpreted as synsedimentary features hypothesized to have been active during Cretaceous deposition (Johnston, 1983), or the result of Quaternary caliche (Lock et al., 2001; Lock, 2010). Interestingly, none of the published works appear to have given serious consideration to the possibility of the structures having a contractional tectonic origin. Both macro- and meso-scale tectonic folds (Fig. 1) have been documented in Cretaceous strata in the Devils River Uplift (represented by basement and Paleozoic strata uplifted during the Paleozoic Ouachita orogeny and again during the Laramide orogeny after Cretaceous sedimentation; Flawn et al., 1961; Nicholas and Rozendal, 1975; Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984) and in the Boquillas Formation in other parts of west Texas (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2016, 2022). The structural style of these folds is reminiscent of tectonic mesoscale folds in carbonate and clastic rocks within contractional regimes globally (e.g., Currie et al., 1962; Groshong, 1975a, 1975b; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989; Dahlstrom, 1990; Hogan and Dunne, 2001; Boyer and Mitra, 2019).\nIn this paper, we explore these mesostructures in detail, characterizing fold orientations, performing local structural interpretations and restorations, and analyzing veins associated with the folds using fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analyses. Based on results of these investigations, we conclude that the folds are tectonic in origin and formed under considerable overburden, consistent with the regionally recognized Laramide shortening in the region (Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984).\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe study area consists of outcrops of the Boquillas Formation within the Devils River Uplift of west Texas (Fig. 1). The Boquillas Formation, and laterally equivalent Eagle Ford Formation east of the Devils River, were deposited in the Late Cretaceous between about 98 and 90\u00a0Ma (Minisini et al., 2018) during a tectonically quiet period in the region. The Boquillas-Eagle Ford section thickens laterally into the Maverick Basin, which is centered approximately 150\u00a0km southeast of the present study area (Donovan et al., 2012; Breyer et al., 2016; Rose, 2016). The basal Boquillas Formation in the area has abundant limestone beds with hydrodynamic features indicating bottom currents and influence of storm waves, as well as finely laminated mudrock and volcanic ash beds, indicating lower energy conditions (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Increasing water depth during deposition resulted in an extensive section representing pelagic sedimentation below storm wave base, with deposits dominated by organic-rich mudrock separated by periodic chalk beds, as well as thin volcanic ash beds (Breyer, 2016; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). After this prolonged period of pelagic sedimentation, gradual shallowing of water depths led to a return to higher energy conditions on the seafloor and deposition of the upper Boquillas Formation, represented by thicker chalk beds, limestone beds, and hydrodynamic structures indicating marine currents and wave influence on deposition (Lehrmann et al., 2019).\nThe Devils River Uplift along the southern edge of the Val Verde Basin is a long-lived tectonic feature (Ewing, 1985). At depth, the uplift is represented by thrust- or reverse-faulted Paleozoic strata emplaced during the Ouachita orogeny along with underlying Precambrian meta-igneous rocks (Flawn et al., 1961; Nicholas and Rozendal, 1975; Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Nicholas, 1983). Subsequently eroded between the Permian and Cretaceous, the Devils River Uplift and adjacent Val Verde basin to the north were then buried by unconformable Cretaceous strata. The Devils River Uplift experienced minor additional uplift during the Laramide orogeny, which produced contractional anticlines and synclines, monoclinal flexures, and some contractional faulting (Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984). These contractional structures occur along the margins of the Devils River Uplift as well as within the uplift and beyond its perimeter. Based on mapping deformation in the Cretaceous strata around the margins of the Devils River Uplift, Calhoun and Webster (1983) interpreted that this deformation could \u201cbest be explained by a compressive stress regime with the primary compressive stress direction oriented about N40\u00b0E\u201d.\nWest of the Devils River Uplift, contractional folds deforming Cretaceous strata are mapped in and around the Sierra del Carmen and westward across Big Bend National Park (Moustafa, 1988; Erdlac, 1990; Turner et al., 2011; Surpless et al., 2015; Ferrill et al., 2016; Surpless and Wigginton, 2020). These structures are generally consistent with NE-directed shortening associated with Laramide-age deformation, which is interpreted to have occurred from Late Cretaceous to Eocene in this region (\u223c80\u201340\u00a0Ma; Lehman, 1991; Goldhammer and Johnson, 1991). South of the Devils River Uplift in the Sabinas Basin of northeast Mexico, contractional folds are mapped in Cretaceous strata with dominant fold trends ranging from NW-SE to E-W indicative of NE-SW to N\u2013S directed shortening (Humphrey, 1956). Southeast of the Devils River Uplift, the SE-plunging Chittim anticline lies between the Rio Grande syncline (Fowler, 1956) or Eagle syncline (Rose, 1984) to the southwest near the Rio Grande, and the Zavala syncline to the northeast (Fig. 1). Formation of these folds, which all deform Cretaceous strata, is consistent with formation in response to NE-SW-directed Laramide shortening (Rose, 1984; Scott, 2010; Ewing, 2016).\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nStructural characterization: folds, veins, faults, and fractures\nStructural geologic characterization was performed on three pairs of NNE-SSW trending road cut exposures of the Boquillas Formation within the Devils River Uplift of west Texas. Initial structural observations from the exposures identified folds, extension fractures, and faults. Although stylolites (compactional and tectonic) have been observed in the region (most commonly in the underlying Buda Formation), none were observed in these exposures.\nDeformation in the exposures is dominated by folding, where more than 100 anticlines are present, typically separated by broad flat-bottomed synclines. Fold characterization involved measuring representative bedding orientations in equivalent beds on opposing limbs of each anticline. From these measurements, fold axes, fold interlimb angles, and axial surface orientations were determined using standard stereographic techniques (Ramsay, 1967; Ragan, 1973; Ramsay and Huber, 1987).\nFracture characterization in the outcrops focused on measuring fracture orientations and evaluating failure mode and sense of motion. This was done to provide context for selection of vein samples representative of (i) different orientation (high angle to bedding versus bed-parallel) or failure mode (tensile versus shear) sets, and (ii) different vein and fold relationships in the exposures. Calcite cemented opening mode extension fractures (veins) are most common in the exposures, but reverse and normal faults with vein cement are also present as noted above.\n\n\n3.2\nCross-section construction and restoration\nSeveral structures in the exposures were selected as examples to analyze in greater detail and mapped on digital photographs or photogrammetric models. Using Move 2019.1\u2122 (Petroleum Experts), these interpretations were projected onto a plane oriented perpendicular to fold axes. Two fold structures were analyzed by preparing fold-axis perpendicular cross sections interpreted from outcrop photographs. In both of these structures, bed-perpendicular calcite veins have been offset by bedding-plane flexural slip. Sense of shear and displacement magnitude of marker calcite veins were used as inputs for kinematic restoration and forward modeling of fold structures.\nIn addition to the cross-section analysis of these two folds, close-range oblique aerial photographs of the site were collected with a Phantom 4 Pro unmanned aerial vehicle with onboard 20 megapixel camera. Aerial images were used to generate a photogrammetric point-cloud and textured mesh reconstruction of the western roadcut of the northern pair of the exposures, and georeferencing of digital data was carried out using real-time kinematic differential global positional system (RTKDGPS) ground control points. Digital mapping of bedding horizons and fold geometries was performed using the photogrammetric model of the outcrop. Digital interpretations were then projected to a cross section perpendicular to the average fold axis orientation, and kinematic restoration of projected polyline interpretations (using Move 2019.1\u2122) was performed (i) over the entire western roadcut of the northern pair of the exposures, (ii) in greater detail over a region covering approximately half of this exposure, and (iii) at a high level of detail across four fold structures in the southern part of this western roadcut exposure.\n\n\n3.3\nVein fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analysis\nSampling of veins from various locations, and with different relative timing with respect to folds, was performed to assess fluid composition and depth-pressure conditions at the time of vein formation. Samples included bed-parallel veins, sub-vertical veins, extension veins along fold hinge or axial surface, sub-vertical veins that have been offset by bed-parallel flexural slip on fold limbs, and both normal and reverse faults.\nAnalyses of fluid inclusions and stable isotope geochemistry were performed on samples of vein calcite from faults and extension fractures in the Boquillas Formation to constrain vein formation temperatures and associated fluid history. These analyses were conducted as part of a regional study of the Eagle Ford Formation and laterally equivalent Boquillas Formation (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017, 2020b, 2022) and underlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a). Collection of samples and preparation and analysis methods for fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry in this study are identical to those described by Ferrill et al. (2020a).\n\n3.3.1\nFluid inclusion microthermometry and UV fluorescence\nVein formation temperature and paleo-fluid composition were constrained by fluid inclusion microthermometry of two-phase aqueous inclusions in the calcite cement. The homogenization temperature (ThA) provides the fluid trapping temperature and the basis for estimating depth of vein formation, while the ice-melting temperature (Tm) is used to determine the trapped fluid salinity (e.g., Evans and Battles, 1999; Parris et al., 2003; Hanks et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2010; Evans, 2010; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017a; 2020a, 2022).\nIn addition, liquid hydrocarbon fluid inclusions were identified by UV fluorescence, which is used to compare trapped fluids between samples to distinguish trapping events. This method has been used extensively to characterize liquid hydrocarbon inclusions (e.g., Bourdet and Eadington, 2012; Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014; Evans et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017, 2020a, 2022; Volk and George, 2019). The API gravity of the trapped hydrocarbon inclusions can be estimated by the fluorescence color (e.g., Burruss et al., 1983, 1985; McLimans, 1987; Burruss, 1991; Lisk and Eadington, 1994; Parnell et al., 1998). However, the fluorescence color can be affected by a variety of factors including migration fractionation, biodegradation, fluid mixing, and water-washing (George et al., 2001).\n\n\n3.3.2\nStable isotope analysis\nOxygen and carbon isotope analyses were performed on samples of calcite fracture cements and their associated host rocks to determine geochemical relationships between veins and evaluate the source of mineralizing fluids (e.g., Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017, 2020a, 2022). Where possible, \u223c100\u00a0mg of vein material was sampled from each vein mineral stage and host rock. However, in most veins the different vein stages were too thin to sample with this approach, and the vein histories are complex at the microscale, therefore whole-vein bulk samples were analyzed. Oxygen and carbon stable isotopic analyses of calcite veins and carbonate-rich host rocks were done by Yale University Earth System Center for Stable Isotopic Studies using a Thermo MAT 254 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer equipped with a KIEL IV Carbonate Device. Mineral samples were reacted at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min in 104% phosphoric acid. Results are reported on the Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB) scale by correcting sample data with Yale-in-house carbonate reference materials PX and MERC. Analytical precision (1 sigma) of Quality Control reference carbonate YM (n\u00a0=\u00a014) is 0.03\u2030 for \u03b413C and 0.04\u2030 for \u03b418O.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFold analysis\n\n4.1.1\nFold measurements\nFolds in the exposure range from \u223c100-m-wavelength scale, down to minor anticlinal folds with wavelengths of 10's of cm to several meters (Fig. 2\n). The structural style is dominated by relatively narrow anticlines separated by broad flat-bottomed synclines. These small anticlines have detachment fold geometries, with upwardly amplifying folds above detachments in volcanic ash or mudrock layers. In general, a series of multiple folds is detached along a consistent detachment horizon. In some cases, one detachment horizon with overlying folds has been folded by detachment folds formed above a deeper detachment (discussed in next section). Cores of detachment folds exhibit thickening by wedge thrusts, small-scale folds (cm-scale wavelengths), and ductile flow (Fig. 2). Pairs of corresponding bedding measurements \u2013 from equivalent beds on either side of the fold hinge \u2013 were made from opposing limbs of 120 anticlinal folds. These bedding measurements were used to determine the fold axis, axial surface orientation, and interlimb angle for each fold (Table 1\n). Fold axes are mapped in Fig. 3\n, and a stereonet plot of the fold axes is shown in Fig. 4\na. Stereographic analysis shows a dominant fold axis trend of WNW-ESE with an average fold axis trend\/plunge of 281\u00b0\/01\u00b0 (Fig. 4a). Analysis of axial surface orientations shows that axial surfaces verge both to the SSW and NNE (Fig. 4b). The average axial surface strike\/dip is 100\u00b0\/90\u00b0. Fold interlimb angles range from 42\u00b0 to 162\u00b0, with a mean and standard deviation of 111\u00b0 and 26\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). This fold pattern is consistent with NNE-SSW-directed shortening.\n\n\n4.1.2\nFold cross-sections and restorations\nInterpretations of field photographs were used to capture detailed geometries for two of the fold structures (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). Horizon interpretations document the presence of multiple detachment levels and associated small-scale detachment folds within a larger-scale fold structure in the eastern roadcut of the southern pair of exposures (Fig. 5a). Evidence for bedding-parallel slip is documented on the limbs of this fold where top to NNE and top to SSW layer-parallel offset of bed-perpendicular calcite veins is evident on the SSW and NNE limbs of the fold, respectively (Figs. 5b and c). A fold exposed in the western roadcut of the southern pair of exposures (Fig. 6a) also exhibits offset of bed-perpendicular calcite veins on both fold limbs \u2013 specifically, top to NNE bedding-parallel slip on the SSW limb, and top to SSW slip on the NNE limb of the fold (Fig. 6b and c). Up-dip layer-parallel displacement of calcite veins on fold limbs, and local vergence of layer-parallel slip towards fold crests is consistent with flexural-slip folding in a contractional regime after bed-perpendicular vein formation (e.g., Ramsay, 1967, 1974; Tanner, 1989; Tavani et al., 2015).\nFlexural slip\/flexural flow, line length balanced restorations of the two folds (Figs. 5d and 6d) yield estimated local shortening magnitudes of 6% and 11% for these structures, although overall shortening by folding through these exposures is less than 5%, as discussed below. Restorations for both folds show a systematic increase in restored line length upwards, and therefore an increase in contractional strain upwards through the folds.\nForward modeling of the fold structures was carried out by deforming the restored cross sections to their present-day geometries using a combined flexural flow and flexural slip approach. Passive strain markers in the forward models (Figs. 5e and 6e) illustrate the general increase in shortening strain upwards through both folds, and in the case of Fig. 5 fold, multiple detachment levels and associated thickening of deformed strata. Deformable pin lines in Figs. 5 and 6 mark interpreted null points, where layer-parallel slip (as manifest by offset bed-perpendicular calcite veins) approaches zero within fold hinges, and therefore represent the approximate positions and shapes of fold axial traces both prior to (Figs. 5d and 6d) and after contractional deformation (Figs. 6e and 5e).\nProjected polyline interpretations from the western roadcut of the northern pair of exposures provide a more regional view of deformation patterns at the site (Fig. 7\n). Typical of the small folds in the study area, anticlines are relatively widely spaced \u2013 often several meters to 10's of m apart \u2013 through these roadside outcrops. In Fig. 7d, two detachment levels are visible, including a main detachment level, and an upper minor detachment level with multiple small detachment folds developed above it. The upper minor detachment horizon is folded by folds formed above the main detachment level.\nSimple line length restorations for photogrammetry-derived interpretations yield shortening magnitudes of 2.1% for the entire western roadcut of the northern pair of exposures (Fig. 7a), 3.9% over a region covering approximately half of this exposure (Fig. 7b), and 4.2% for the area that exposes four relatively closely spaced folds in the southern part of this western roadcut exposure (Fig. 7c). Estimated shortening magnitudes for field photograph interpretations (Figs. 5 and 6) and photogrammetry-derived interpretations (Fig. 7) record a trend of decreased shortening magnitudes with larger scales of observation. This result is expected, given that contractional deformation at the site is highest at individual fold structures that are relatively widely spaced across the roadside exposures.\nThere is also a general trend, across scales of observation, for increased folding upwards from the detachment (Figs. 5\u20137). The observed vertical variation in macroscale shortening of pre-kinematic strata suggests that varying amounts of layer-parallel shortening may have been accommodated at smaller scale, below the resolution of the cross section (e.g., Geiser, 1988; Ferrill and Dunne, 1989), and\/or layer-parallel shear transferred displacement laterally (c.f., Epard and Groshong, 1993; Boyer and Mitra, 2019).\n\n\n\n4.2\nExtension fractures, faults and associated calcite veins\nOpening-mode, calcite-cemented extension veins are relatively common in the exposure. These veins typically cut bedding at a high angle. Strikes of 38 measured veins are centered around E-W, ranging from NE-SW to NW-SE (Fig. 8\na). These veins strike approximately parallel to the fold axes, and may have formed to accommodate extension prior to folding (e.g., forebulge flexure; Lash and Engelder, 2007; Tavani et al., 2015; Stage 1a in Ferrill et al., 2021), during folding due to bending strain (outer-arc extension in fold hinges), or during post-folding extensional relaxation. This pattern appears to contrast with the regionally common dominant bimodal NW and NE fracture strikes observed in the Eagle Ford and Boquillas Formations (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2022; Gottardi and Mason, 2018). Rare subhorizontal bed-parallel opening-mode veins were also observed, indicating vertical minimum principal compressive stress representative of a thrust-faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021) and likely occurred roughly coevally with contractional folding. Formation of bed-parallel veins at this location is also consistent with observations of bed-parallel veins formed during folding in the Boquillas Formation further west (Fig. 8a; Ferrill et al., 2022). While faults are not abundant in these exposures, small-displacement reverse faults are more common than normal faults (Fig. 8b). Dominant strike for nine measured reverse faults is WNW-ESE to WSW-ENE, generally consistent with dominant fold axis orientations and with NNE-SSW shortening in a thrust-faulting stress regime. Dominant strike from five measured normal faults is NW-SE (Fig. 8b), consistent with formation in a normal faulting stress regime either before or after development of the thrust-faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.3\nVein fluid history and conditions\nVeins in the exposures include sets that are (i) parallel to bedding, and (ii) at a high angle to bedding. Bedding-parallel veins are filled by blocky calcite. High angle to bedding veins are also typically filled by blocky calcite. Fifteen calcite vein samples were collected and analyzed from the Boquillas Formation in this study (Fig. 9\n; Table 2\n), and calcite ranges from single to multiple stages of weakly to moderately twinned blocky calcite to crack-seal textures (Fig. 10\n; Table 2; cf. Ramsay, 1980). Four veins (SN1149-023, \u2212029, \u2212030, \u2212036) exhibit evidence of dissolution after vein cementation and prior to additional cementation by blocky calcite (Table 2).\n\n4.3.1\nFluid inclusion types\nDark (black) to brown tinted single-phase inclusions that are interpreted to be liquid hydrocarbon are present in all veins and in most vein mineral stages. These hydrocarbon inclusions exhibit a wide range of fluorescence behavior, ranging from very weak or no fluorescence (indicating loss of aromatic components; Alpern et al., 1993) to green and pale blue fluorescence colors (Table 2). Two-phase aqueous inclusions that contain water and a vapor bubble suitable for microthermometry are present in four samples (Table 2). The two-phase aqueous inclusions used for microthermometry are typically <5 to over 20 \u03bcm in size and irregularly shaped. Inclusion origins are interpreted to be pseudosecondary or could not be determined, and therefore classified as undifferentiated (Table 2). Commonly, aqueous inclusions lack a vapor bubble and indicate the fluids were trapped at relatively low temperatures and pressures, and that there was not enough energy to nucleate a vapor bubble upon cooling and are therefore in a metastable state (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). These inclusions are common regionally in the Boquillas Formation and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation (Ferrill et al., 2014a, 2014b; 2017, 2022) and overlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a).\n\n\n4.3.2\nAqueous inclusion results\nFour samples (SN1149-024, \u2212029, \u2212030, \u2212031) yielded microthermometric data for 14 fluid inclusion assemblages. Upon heating, the two-phase aqueous inclusions homogenized to the liquid phase at temperatures ranging from 71.3 to 100.5\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 2; Fig. 11\n). During cooling runs, the vapor bubbles of many aqueous inclusions completely collapsed during freezing but then reappeared upon warming. For those inclusions where ice melted in the presence of a vapor bubble, the Tm values ranged from \u22120.5 to 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating salinities of 0.0\u20130.9\u00a0wt % NaCl equivalent (Table 2; Fig. 11; Roedder, 1984).\n\n\n4.3.3\nAqueous fluid trapping conditions\nResults from the fluid inclusion microthermometry can be used to estimate the fluid trapping conditions. The occurrence of subhorizontal bed-parallel veins indicates that fluid pressure exceeded the overburden stress at the time of bed-parallel vein formation (Ukar et al., 2017; Hooker et al., 2019; Ferrill et al., 2022). Rose (2016) estimated the depths of burial for the Boquillas Formation at Lozier Canyon (79\u00a0km northwest of the study area) to be 1.83\u20132.38\u00a0km, with a median of 2.24\u00a0km, and at the West Comstock field site (22\u00a0km northwest of the study area) to be 1.34\u20131.68\u00a0km with a median of 1.52\u00a0km. Rose (2016) estimated the paleogeothermal gradient for the Comstock West area to be 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 and for the Lozier Canyon area to be 22\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121.\nHere we use the 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 geothermal gradient of Rose (2016) and a paleo-surface temperature during the Cretaceous of 20\u00a0\u00b0C (Ferrill et al., 2020a). Due to the association of aqueous and liquid hydrocarbon inclusions, we assume that aqueous inclusions are methane saturated and a pressure correction is not needed. The lower temperature values from all of the sites range from 71.3 to 88.6\u00a0\u00b0C, providing a trapping depth of 2.23\u20132.98\u00a0km. These values encompass those determined by Rose (2016) for Lozier Canyon, but are significantly higher than those of his Comstock West site. In contrast, the higher homogenization temperatures from the exposures along Hwy 90 West of Del Rio (90.2\u2013100.5\u00a0\u00b0C) suggest a trapping depth of 3.05\u20133.50\u00a0km, significantly higher than either of Rose's (2016) sites, but less than the maximum depth estimate for the Sycamore Bluffs location described by Ferrill et al. (2017), 48\u00a0km southeast of the present study location. High temperature values were also reported by Ferrill et al. (2014b, 2020a) in the Eagle Ford in this area and to the southeast. The higher temperature trapping event may be the result of either (i) deep burial at the time of trapping, or (ii) migration of high temperature fluid into the Boquillas and Eagle Ford Formations.\n\n\n4.3.4\nHydrocarbon inclusion fluorescence\nFour samples from this site have fluorescent hydrocarbon inclusions (Table 2). Sample SN1149-021 from a small normal fault has inclusions with a light blue-green fluorescence, while three extension veins (SN1149-024, \u2212029, \u2212030) have pale blue fluorescence (Fig. 12\n). These fluorescence colors are indicative of 31\u201336\u00b0 API oils (Fig. 12).\n\n\n4.3.5\nStable isotope results\nAll vein isotopic values are significantly different from their associated host rocks (Table 2, Fig. 13\na), indicating that the isotopic composition of the fluids and vein calcite that precipitated from the fluids, were in an isotopically open fluid system. Neither \u03b413C nor \u03b418O values from host rock samples correspond to the expected values for Late Cretaceous carbonates (Fig. 13a; Veizer et al., 1999). This observation suggests significant whole rock alteration since the Cretaceous, consistent with other studies from Austin Chalk, Boquillas Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation in the region (Ferrill et al., 2017, 2020a, 2022). Calcite vein \u03b418O values in all analyzed veins show a very consistent pattern of veins being 2 to 9 per mil lower in \u03b418O than the host rocks (Fig. 13a; Table 2). In general, most veins have only slightly elevated or reduced \u03b413C values with respect to host rock values, with maximum observed increase or decrease of 4 per mil.\n\n\n4.3.6\nEquilibrium fluid calculation\nBy integrating the fluid inclusion ThA data and oxygen isotopic data, the oxygen isotopic composition of the fluid that precipitated the vein minerals can be determined to provide information on the relative contributions of meteoric and formation water to the precipitating fluids. The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite depends on the isotopic composition of the fluid from which it precipitates and the isotopic fractionation between the fluid and the solid. If we assume precipitation in equilibrium with the fluids, the fractionation will depend upon the temperature of the fluids. If the temperature of the fluid is known from the fluid inclusions, the isotopic composition of the fluid can be calculated for calcite-water fractionation using the equation of Friedman and O'Neil (1977). Calculated fluid compositions from the five sites that have ThA data exhibit a narrow range of \u03b418O, from \u22123.78\u2030 to \u22120.12\u2030 V-SMOW indicating meteoric to near seawater isotopic fluid compositions (Fig. 13b).\n\n\n4.3.7\nSummary of fluid history and conditions\nFluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis of veins from this study provide evidence for an evolving fluid system that was generally open to external fluids as evidenced by occurrence of liquid hydrocarbon inclusions and variation in their fluorescence. In addition, the veins that show higher temperature trapping events at the study site suggest a potential fluid influx from deeper and warmer source formations. The oxygen equilibrium fluid values along with the low salinity of the aqueous inclusions suggest a meteoric fluid influx to at least the depth of the formations in this study.\nVein samples from this site are from the central cores of these fold structures as well as fold limbs and from a bed-parallel vein system. These veins in particular record the high temperature fluid trapping event (90.2\u2013100.5\u00a0\u00b0C) that was likely near maximum burial or possibly sourced by deeper fluids. Subhorizontal bed-parallel fracture formation suggests conditions of high pore fluid pressure that was able to overcome the overburden stress to produce vertical dilation in a thrust faulting stress regime, likely coeval with folding.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTectonic origin of folds\nThe folds investigated in this study have been referred to as \u2018tepees\u2019 and variably interpreted as being related to processes penecontemporaneous with Late Cretaceous deposition (Johnston, 1983), including (i) expansion of a carbonate hardground during deposition in a subtidal to supratidal carbonate depositional environment (Southern Association of Student Geological Societies, 1990; Willett, 1990), and (ii) precipitation and dissolution of gypsum during tidal-flat deposition or subsequent shallow burial (McDaniel, 1992). These so-called \u2018tepees\u2019 have also been interpreted to be related to Quaternary or late Cenozoic wedging by caliche formation along fractures and shale beds after burial and exhumation to near the ground surface (Lock et al., 2001; Lock, 2010). In addition, small-scale folding can also result from downslope movement or slumping of subaqueous sediments and formation of mass transport deposits (see Alsop et al., 2022, and references therein).\nExtensive recent work on the Boquillas Formation and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation in and around the study area have now documented that these formations were deposited in a basinal depositional environment, with most of the section deposited via pelagic sedimentation below storm wave base, rather than in tidal flat depositional environments (Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Donovan et al., 2012; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Thus, interpretations of the formation of these structures due to tidal-flat processes (e.g., Assereto and Kendall, 1977; Kendall and Warren, 1987) are inherently untenable.\nSlump folds can form in unlithified or \u2018soft\u2019 sediments as gravitationally driven structures (Alvarez and Lowrie, 1984; Alsop and Marco, 2014) associated with formation on a depositional slope and can occur on extremely gentle slopes (<1\u00b0; Garc\u00eda-Tortosa et al., 2011; Alsop and Marco, 2014). During deposition of the Boquillas-Eagle Ford sediments, the study area was at the NW edge of the Maverick Basin (Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Donovan et al., 2012; Breyer et al., 2016; Rose, 2016). If movement was down a depositional slope into the Maverick Basin to the SE, fold axes would be expected to trend NE-SW rather than WNW-ESE as observed in the present study. Soft-sedimentary slump folding is present elsewhere in the Boquillas and Eagle Ford Formations, occurring in zones 1\u20132\u00a0m thick and with lateral continuity of 10's to 100's of meters to >1\u00a0km (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). These folds typically exhibit inclined to recumbent axial surfaces, and highly curved hinges in some cases changing trend by 90\u00b0 or more over short distances within an outcrop indicative of sheath fold geometries. Some exposures reveal lens or eye-shaped fold patterns reflective of cone or tubular shapes characteristic of sheath fold geometries (cf. Alsop and Holdsworth 2004; Alsop and Carreras, 2007). In these intervals, carbonate (limestone and chalk) and mudrock beds tend to exhibit significant thickness changes, disarticulation of beds, and evidence of significant ductile flowage of mudrock and carbonate beds, and vertical thinning due to subsequent compaction. The folds in the present study do not exhibit evidence of soft-sedimentary deformation processes (c.f., Alsop et al., 2022), but instead are represented by continuity of layering and brittle deformation (extension fracturing, faulting) and folding of competent beds (limestones, chalks) with relatively uniform thicknesses, typical of deformation of lithified rock layers. Thus, we see no evidence to support a soft sedimentary slumping origin for the folds in the present study. Furthermore, low salinity aqueous fluid inclusions from veins that predated folding are indicative of a meteoric water source, which cannot be explained by submarine slump folding of sediments contemporaneous with deposition.\nOur analyses document that calcite veins were formed by brittle fracturing and cementation during moderate burial (i.e., 2\u20133\u00a0km) and in many cases have been offset by flexural slip during folding (Fig. 14\n), indicating that the calcite veins and folds formed after deposition and lithification. Thin beds occasionally exhibit extension fractures in fold hinges that are bed contained and thicken toward fold outer arcs, consistent with bed scale outer-arc-extension bending strain localized in fold hinges during folding (Fig. 14b). Veins were precipitated by warm, very low salinity aqueous fluids with a meteoric influence (Fig. 13b), and were conduits for the migration of mature liquid hydrocarbons (Fig. 12c). Our analyses also document significant horizontal shortening of limestone beds associated with individual structures and sets of structures and continuity of carbonate beds across anticline crests (e.g., Figs. 2, 5, 6, 7) \u2013 observations that are inconsistent with the \u201cvertical lifting up by caliche wedges\u201d model interpreted by Lock et al. (2001; their figure 16B). Caliche is certainly present at the top of the exposures as a thin platy layer, and locally present along some beds and fractures or faults as described by Lock et al. (2001). However, many areas of caliche in the exposures are only a veneer on the outcrop that can be scraped away to reveal continuous laminations in calcareous mudrock, as well as folding and thrust faulting of these laminations that record the thickening mechanisms (Fig. 2). Fold axis orientations for 120 fold structures in the exposures define a dominant WNW-ESE trend (Fig. 3) that is consistent with larger-scale folds within the surrounding Devils River Uplift, and to the south in the Sabinas Basin in Mexico. These fold axis orientations are not consistent with gravity driven slumping down a depositional paleoslope to the southeast into the adjacent Maverick Basin. The folds lack growth strata, and postdate extension fractures that formed by brittle failure of lithified strata and are offset by flexural slip on fold limbs. Veins are cemented by oil-inclusion-bearing calcite veins precipitated from low salinity water rather than seawater. Collectively, the observations and data indicate a tectonic origin for these structures as anticlinal folds, consistent with Laramide contraction in the region.\n\n\n5.2\nDetachment folding\nThe folds range from small (cm- to m-scale wavelengths) to large (wavelengths of 10's to 100's of m). Most of the small-scale folds have amplitudes of 1\u00a0m or less, and these folds are localized above detachments in volcanic ash and mudrock layers that are visible in the exposures. Observed folds generally amplify and tighten upward, consistent with detachment-fold geometries (Dahlstrom, 1990; Epard and Groshong, 1993, 1995; Groshong and Epard, 1994; Homza and Wallace, 1995; Stewart, 1996; Mitra, 2003; Groshong, 2015). Fold amplification occurs by thickening of beds above detachment levels (Figs. 5 and 6). This amplification is represented by thickening of mudrock (shale) beds by both ductile and brittle processes (Fig. 14b), similar to the conceptual model presented by Epard and Groshong (1995; their figure 2). Contorted laminations in some beds illustrate tight folding associated with ductile shortening and thickening (e.g., Figs. 2c and d). Other examples include single or multiple thrust faults that locally thicken beds and amplify folds (e.g., Figs. 2e and f).\nAt least two detachment levels can be observed in the exposures (e.g., Figs. 7c and d). In the northern exposures, a higher detachment is deformed by folds above a deeper detachment horizon. This deformation is consistent with a common break-forward deformation sequence fold-thrust belt (Boyer and Mitra, 2019), where shallow deformation at the leading edge of a thrust belt is subsequently deformed by later deformation initiated deeper in the section.\nThe observed structural style, with relatively tight anticlines separated by broad flat-bottom synclines, is consistent with the deformation style in fold-thrust belts with weak detachments, such as salt or overpressured shale (Davis and Engelder, 1985). The presence of horizontal or subhorizontal bed-parallel opening mode calcite veins (Figs. 9h and i) indicates vertical minimum principal stress and a thrust faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021, 2022, Fig. 14b), and that fluid pressure was high enough to overcome the vertical overburden stress and tensile strength of the rock at the time of horizontal vein formation. Such elevated fluid pressure was likely a major factor for the formation and sliding along bed-parallel detachments and associated folding. Later subvertical veins abut or cut across bed-parallel calcite veins (see Fig. 9i), which we interpret to represent either local normal faulting stress regime conditions (Fig. 14c) due to outer-arc bending strain associated with longer wavelength (100-m scale) folding, or a return to regional normal faulting regime conditions during post-Laramide extensional relaxation. We interpret that this extension produced occasional vertical veins in horizontal beds, fold limbs, and along fold axial surfaces.\nFold trains similar to those documented here are often localized within certain intervals of a stratigraphic section where internal buckling is mechanically preferred over other shortening mechanisms such as distributed cleavage development or thrust faulting. In some cases, localized contractional folding develops as a \u201cfold duplex\u201d where local folding occurs and kinematically transfers displacement between two detachment levels (Dahlstrom, 1990; Boyer and Mitra, 2019). Consequently, detachment fold systems do not tend to be vertically pervasive, but instead tend to be localized above and\/or below detachment horizons that transfer displacement laterally where displacement may be accommodated by contraction at other stratigraphic levels. This pattern of stratigraphically localized contraction rather than pervasive folding is consistent with observations from the study area. Furthermore, small-scale contractional folding, reverse faulting, and bed-parallel vein formation that represents deformation in a thrust faulting stress regime should be expected in the western part of the productive Eagle Ford oil and gas system, which is proximal to the frontal limit of macroscale Laramide contractional deformation (Fig. 1). Both the Zavala syncline and Chittim anticline (southeast of the study locality) fall within the Laramide macrostructural front and represent larger-scale structures of Laramide age, with orientations that are approximately consistent with the outcropping folds documented in this study. The structures documented in this study all contribute to vertical thickening of the stratigraphic section. Dipping beds on fold limbs, small faults, and veins represent mechanical fabric elements that may influence horizontal drilling and permeability structure. These fabrics also may reactivate by slip or dilation during hydraulic fracturing prior to stress conditions being reached necessary for failure of undeformed intact rock. Based on results of investigations presented in this paper, we conclude that the folds are tectonic in origin and formed under considerable overburden. The deformation style is consistent with the regionally recognized Laramide shortening in the region (Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Webster and Calhoun, 1984).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBased on analysis of 120 small-scale anticlines and associated calcite veins, we show that mesoscale folds in the Boquillas Formation within the Devils River Uplift in southwest Texas formed during NNE-SSW directed Laramide shortening while the strata were buried at moderate depths (2.23\u20133.50\u00a0km), rather than via processes penecontemporaneous with Late Cretaceous deposition or near-surface caliche formation during the late Cenozoic. Laramide deformation consisted of broadly NE-SW contraction during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Deposition of the Boquillas Formation pre-dated this deformation and the folds described here have orientations consistent with other Laramide structures nearby. Dominant WNW-ESE fold trends are consistent with larger-scale folds within the surrounding Devils River Uplift, and to the south in the Sabinas Basin in Mexico. The anticlines formed as detachment folds, exhibiting bed-parallel flexural-slip offset of bed-perpendicular extension veins. This relationship provides clear evidence of folding after lithification and brittle (tensile) failure. Detachments in volcanic ash and mudrock were likely severely overpressured at the time, as indicated by the local presence of sub-horizontal bedding parallel blocky calcite veins. Tectonic compaction without draining of these inherently low-permeability strata would have strongly contributed to development and maintenance of the overpressure that allowed bedding-plane slip, ductile behavior of volcanic ash and mudrock beds, and detachment folding.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nDavid A.

Fieldwork promotes an understanding of geological concepts taught in the classroom, allowing students to enhance skills such as rock and surface feature identification and mapping, data recording and reporting and importantly how to visualise and think about the subsurface in three dimensions. Students undertaking extended field trips in geology show significant improvements in their understanding of geoscience concepts when compared to standard campus-based activities alone (Elkins and Elkins., 2007). Spatial awareness is at the core of geosciences and students require a knowledge and understanding of location when undertaking place-based learning (Semken and Freeman., 2008). Interpreting and visualising spatial data acquired during field data collection, and its subsequent integration within Geographical Information Systems (GIS), are now essential tools in geoscience learning (Baban, 2002).\nHelping students acquire this spatial awareness should then form a key part of any geoscience course. Virtual field trips (VFT) are often utilised to prepare students for real-life field work (Cliffe, 2017) and VFT's have been successfully implemented onto curriculum and implemented in a 2D capacity for decades (Hurst, 1998). Research shows that the primary benefit of VFT's is as a preparation tool prior to actual field work. (Arrowsmith et al., 2005). They allow students to view sites not always practical for scientists to visit for field observation. This typically involves the study of 2D cartography and photography and some element of photo interpretation, GIS or data analysis (Carmichael and Tscholl., 2011). It has been found that while students saw VFT's as valuable learning experiences, they did not see them as a direct replacement for real field trips (Spicer and Stratford., 2001; Bond and Cawood., 2021). Traditional VFT's also do not address conceptual difficulties such as relating field observations of outcrops to geological maps, visualising the evolution of geologic structures through time and understanding the 3D nature of geologic structures and how they intersect topography are skills that students find challenging to master in a classroom setting and are often easier to visualise when taught in the field (Whitmeyer et al., 2009). Developments in augmented reality technology could help to bridge this gap, where in-class mapping activities are augmented by other data visualised through a headset. Students have shown increased interest and engagement when using augmented reality in geology (Bursztyn et al., 2017), and that using AR enhanced maps significantly improves three-dimensional geological understanding and development of spatial orientation skills (Carbonell Carrera and Bermejo Asensio, 2016).\nVFT's can be further enhanced using 3D environments, created using UAV-SfM surveys to generate elevation data and mosaiced aerial images, typically viewed on desktops using a 3D model viewer such as ArcScene. The availability of low cost unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) that capture high resolution aerial imagery makes this technology now widely available. Utilising game engine technology, such as the Unreal engine, it is possible for VR environments to be created from these 3D scenes. The increased availability of affordable VR technology, with headsets that can run on standard desktop computers, creates opportunities to build high quality virtual environments that can be explored by students in more immersive ways than traditional 2D geological field teaching allows in the classroom.\nPre-Pandemic studies show that using immersive VR (IVR) in geology teaching was thought of as a promising field but was often not implemented onto existing curriculum and remained a tool for researchers rather than students. (Fowler., 2015; Jiayan Zhao et al., 2017; Radianti et al., 2020). However, delivering high quality VFT's has taken on greater importance due to the rapid increase in blended learning and online digital learning during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Studies undertaken during this time have shown that immersive virtual experiences in geology can support the development of students spatial skills in the absence of traditional field work (Barth et al., 2022; Paz- \u00c1lvarez et al., 2022). VR offers many advantages for students including an increased sense of presence and spatial orientation (Detyna and Kadiri., 2019; Bond and Cawood, 2021) as well as enhanced understanding and learning outcomes when compared to traditional 2D classroom teaching (Klippel et al., 2019; Barth et al., 2022).\nWhile most studies conclude that VFT's, even those including immersive virtual experiences, cannot replace the experience of boots on ground fieldwork (Paz- \u00c1lvarez et al., 2022; Barth el al, 2022; Bond and Cawood, 2021), it is clear that advancements in VR and UAV-SfM technologies provide promising learning tools post pandemic for supporting geosciences field-based learning. Considering the benefits discussed it becomes apparent that integrating this technology into classroom activities and onto current teaching curriculums is important when emerging from the pandemic and addressing the rising demand for blended and online learning.\nThe case study presented here focuses on a DOM of a unique subaerial rift-transform triple junction in the north east of Iceland. Developed from high-resolution drone imagery collected in 2016, this DOM presents a complex tectonic region that holds a great deal of potential for geoscience learning in a remote and unique geologic locale that students would otherwise likely never have the opportunity to visit. Using GeaVR (https:\/\/geavr.eu), a VR software package developed by 3DTeLC and Argo3D, we present a method for generating 3D environments, explore current capabilities of the software and focus on the potential applications in teaching geosciences using a complex structural site such as this. We will draw on first-hand experience of using VR technologies and our development of course content using these models, discussing the benefits to geoscience learning a site like this provides and addressing the limitations of the technology and the barriers to fully implementing IVR as a part of the geoscience curriculum.\n\n\n2\nHusavik Triple Junction\nThis case study will use drone imagery acquired at the Husavik triple junction in northern Iceland, produced by the intersection of the Husavik-Flatey fault (HFF) and rifting in the western margin of the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) called the Theistareykir Fissure Zone (TFZ) in northern Iceland. This is marked by a belt of normal faulting and eruptive fissures referred to as the Theistareykir fissure swarm (Fig. 1\n). This site was chosen because it represents a rare subaerial example of a triple junction, with excellent field examples of a range of surface structural features that have been well documented by field measurements (Rust and Whitworth., 2019). Two drone surveys have been undertaken at the site; the first in 2014 formed the basis for the Rust and Whitworth (2019) study and a second extended drone survey was undertaken in 2016, which forms the basis for this study.\nThe Husavik Triple Junction is part of the divergent Eurasian - North American plate boundary that extends through Iceland, linking the Reykjanes ridge south of the island with the continuation northwards of the mid-Atlantic spreading axis as the Kolbeinsey ridge (Fig. 1). The HFF represents the principal onshore component of the TSZ and is thought to have been initiated 7\u20139\u00a0Ma ago (R\u00f6gnvaldsson et al., 1998). Over an on-land extent of some 25\u00a0km the HFF displays classic features of active strike-slip tectonics, GPS data suggest a current slip rate of \u223c6.8\u00a0mm a\u22121, and four major earthquakes with an estimated magnitude of 6.5 or greater have occurred since 1755 (Opheim and Gudmundsson., 1989; Garcia and Dhont., 2005; Homberg et al., 2010, Fig. 1). Initiation of the NVZ is estimated to have occurred about 8\u20138.5\u00a0Ma after an eastward jump in the rift axis (Garcia et al., 2003). For the NVZ the most notable historical activity is the 1975-84 Krafla eruption, centred about 25\u00a0km south of the study area, which was accompanied by episodic rifting deformation amounting to several metres horizontally, and a few metres vertically, as well as by numerous M5.0\u20136.5 earthquakes (Tryggvason, 1980, 1984; 1986; Bjornsson., 1985; Jouanne et al., 2016).\nBeyond the immediate study area, mapping documents the very complex regional interaction between rifting and transform faulting (Gudmundsson et al., 1993; Gudmundsson, 2007; Iceland GeoSurvey, 2012; Hjartard\u00f3ttir et al., 2015; Pasquar\u00e8 Mariotto et al., 2015; Tibaldi et al., 2016). Of importance for the purposes of the present study, the deformation structures are developed in an extensive sheet of pahoehoe lava flows, constrained to about 12.5 ka BP (Slater, 2001; Stracke et al., 2003) and emitted from the Theistareykir central lava shield to the south of the study area, a smooth and planar tabula rasa that provides a uniquely preserved long-term record of subsequent structural interactions (Figs. 1 and 2\n). More recently the 2.4 ka \u2018Theistareykjhraun\u2019 lavas, easily distinguished by their blocky character, advanced from the shield northwards, and were constrained to the SE corner of the study area by tectonic uplift at the triple junction (Figs. 2 and 3\n). These fortuitous circumstances, coupled with only minor vegetation development, create an area of \u223c1\u00a0km2 containing innumerable fault features displayed in exquisite detail. From the ground, features such as piercing points, slip directions and amounts, and other structural features can be recognised and measured very accurately.\nA survey on foot also enables primary lava features, such as fracturing associated with inflation and deflation in the pahoehoe flow field, to be recognised. However, crucially, distinguishing between these primary fractures and the subsequent innumerable tectonic fractures is often extremely difficult at ground level and demands the bird's eye perspective provided by low-altitude drone imagery.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThis study describes the use of IVR for geological survey, structural mapping and analysis of the tectonic features at the Husavik-Flatey Triple Junction, northern Iceland, a remarkable site formed from the subaerial triple-junction intersection between the Husavik-Flatey Fault (HFF) dextral transform and rifting in the Northern Volcanic Zone (Fig. 1). The site was initially surveyed in detail and drone imagery was acquired in 2014 (Rust and Whitworth., 2019); and again in 2016. Subsequent to this, both sets of drone data have been used to create a high-resolution VR model of the area, fully navigable using VR headsets and controllers. The model allows the user to navigate the immersive environment, either by flying or walking, when using the headset, undertake GIS style feature mapping (dropping points, line and polygon features using the controllers) and export these features in a spatial rich format for desktop GIS processing and visualization (for an overview of the VR workflow, see Krokos et al., 2019, Antoniou et al., 2020 and Tibaldi et al., 2020).\n\nFig. 2 illustrates the key stages in the conversion of raw drone imagery acquired over a site of interest to a full VR model that can be navigated using Oculus Rift headset and controllers. In this methodology section we will detail these steps prior to presenting our observations from a virtual walkover survey and mapping in the VR environment for the Husavik site.\n\n3.1\nField data mapping and measurement\nThe original field mapping was undertaken to address the need for very detailed mapping of small-scale tectonic structures; this involved a field survey coupled with detailed GPS referenced ground measurements and field surveys with mapping at approximately 1:200 scale using imagery obtained from low-altitude GPS-controlled drone surveys. Field data collection involved a small team working systematically across the mapping area; piercing points were identified and measurements of slip direction and displacement amount were recorded. Each piercing point was carefully selected, so that only those with a clear match on either side of the fracture opening were used to measure the opening direction and opening amount. A handheld GPS was used to locate each piercing point location, and a measuring tape and compass were used to measure the offset (opening direction and amount). A total of 120 piercing points were identified across the entire area, for which horizontal offset amount and direction were recorded. The plunge (vertical offset) of the slip directions were too small to be accurately measured and were disregarded from this study.\nDuring the walk over survey, it was common to encounter localised gravity collapse of the lava sheets into the voids created by the open fracture system. This mass movement exploited the columnar jointing that is pervasive through the lava sheets, causing individual columns to become detached and the surrounding joints to become dilated, thereby obscuring piercing point directions and exaggerating opening amounts. Consequently, it was necessary to carefully differentiate between those open fractures caused by this gravity driven collapse of the lava sheets and only record piercing points representing true fault slip offset amount and direction.\nThis field data collection was supplemented by a contemporaneous survey using an.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle using a Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) data processing framework. Aerial imagery was acquired using a small multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle which was then post-processed to generate an ortho-rectified mosaiced colour image and Digital Surface Model of ground elevation (DSM). The drone used was a DJI Phantom 3 quadcopter fitted with onboard autopilot and GPS receiver, capable of automatic mission planning. A drone mounted camera captured vertical overlapping photographs of the ground surface at a resolution of 12 megapixels. GPS ground control points were installed across the study area using white markers to provide GPS calibration for post processing of the photography. The imagery acquired from the drone survey provided very high-resolution georeferenced image mosaic that was visualised in GIS to help extend field observations beyond visible line of sight. This highlighted spatial relationships between tectonic deformation features and helped distinguish them from primary features, such as the emplacement of the lavas or areas of mass movements and lava toppling, which at ground level were difficult to differentiate from other fault structures.\n\n\n3.2\nStructure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry\nTwo drone surveys were undertaken to map the Husavik-Flatey Triple Junction site. This study used the second of the two drone surveys that was flown in 2016; the first survey in 2014 has been described by Rust and Whitworth (2019). The 2016 drone survey adopted an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with Structure from motion (SfM) framework. Firstly, high-resolution aerial photography was acquired from a low altitude drone. The drone was flown on a mixture of autopilot and manual flight plans, at a height of approximately 90\u00a0m above the ground surface in order to capture images with a ground surface distance of 4\u00a0cm per pixel. GPS control points were deployed across the study area to provide GPS calibration for subsequent SFM post-processing. Six separate flight lines were required to image the extended area of interest, resulting in acquisition of some 600 separate photographs in each survey. The resulting individual photographs and GPS information were post-processed using the commercial software package Agisoft PhotoScan version 1.4 to create a colour ortho-mosaiced image and DSM of the survey area by stitching the individual photographs. The image ortho-mosaic generated from the drone survey is shown in Fig. 3 and a comparison of the ortho-mosaic generated from the drone survey and the same area in Google Earth imagery is shown in Fig. 4\n. The full extent of the technical background of this approach is not detailed here, but the use of UAV-SfM for geological and geomorphological applications has been described by Bemis et al. (2014), Carrivick et al. (2016) and Smith et al. (2016).\n\n\n3.3\nVirtual reality model creation\nThe final stage of the workflow involved conversion of the 3D Tiled model into files compatible for VR Unity engine for viewing using a head mounted display (HMD) (in this study, we used Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest headsets, see https:\/\/www.oculus.com). This is the final stage of the workflow and involves capturing the output from SfM process in Agisoft Photoscan to create Unity VR compatible files (https:\/\/www.unity.com). To achieve this, a 3D Tiled model is created in AgiSoft Photoscan from the completed model including both mesh and texture components (using the elevation model and colour orthomosaic created from the individual aerial photographs, as inputs). To perform this conversion, Agisoft Tile Archive - OBJ file export format is selected, with a medium quality set-up with a tile size of 4096\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04096 pixels, these OBJ files are then compatible with the Unity file converter that creates the Scene files required for VR viewing in Unity. These scene files are loaded using the GeaVR viewing tool. Both the converter and viewer tools were created as part of the Erasmus+ funded project 2017-1-UK01-KA203-036719 and the MIUR project ACPR15T4_00098\u2013Argo3D (http:\/\/argo3d.unimib.it\/). The GeaVR software used in the study is available at https:\/\/geavr.eu and all learning resources are available to download from http:\/\/www.3dtelc.com. For an example application and description of the workflow using these tools, see Krokos et al. (2019), Tibaldi et al. (2020) and Antoniou et al. (2020).\n\n\n3.4\nVirtual reality set-up\nThe VR viewer requires scene file inputs to create the virtual environment, these have been created from the Photoscan OBJ file output. These scene files are chosen at startup (Fig. 5\n shows the scene selection options in GeaVR) and allows the user to define the start location for their avatar in Unity, prior to the creation of the virtual environment.\nThe 3D environment is created from the elevation model that provides the height map and the colour imagery that generates the image texture for the model. Fig. 6\n shows an example view from the user's avatar illustrating the VR experience. Once inside the VR model, the user has a choice of three traversal options including 1) walking, 2) drone and 3) flight modalities. Walking mode allows the user to traverse the area on foot, simulating normal field navigation in the virtual environment. The user is fixed to the ground but can move in any direction at a fixed speed and avatar height set to 1.8\u00a0m. The drone mode replicates the vertical, lateral and rotational movements of a quadcopter drone and allows the user to pan along outcrops, not possible on foot. The flight mode, by contrast, replicates the action of an aerial platform, whereby the user's viewpoint is in a fixed position looking vertically downward from beneath the aircraft. Traversing using either of the two virtual flight modes gives the user a bird's eye view of the VR model. The system allows rapid switching between the three navigation modes, allowing the user to switch from aerial view to ground surface view and vice versa, not possible with normal field mapping.\nOnce inside VR, the GeaVR platform provides the user with a range of virtual tools (Fig. 6) that replicate navigation and field data collection. Firstly, depending on the traversal mode, the user can control the movement of the avatar on the ground or in the air using the left of the two hand-held controllers that come with the HMD. Secondly, the user can activate a set of mapping and measurement tools for data collection while in motion, using the second controller. These tools include feature mapping by placing points, lines or polygons to delineate landforms on the ground surface, generating topographic profiles along a line between two points, measuring the distance between two points, orientation measurement using a compass, recording the dip, inclination and orientation of surfaces and taking georeferenced photographs of the user's viewpoint in VR using a virtual camera. All outputs can be exported for use outside of the virtual environment, for example, the points, lines or polygon mapping can later be exported for use in GIS, either in KML or CSV format and the profile data can be exported as CSV data for viewing and plotting in Microsoft.\nThe DOM of the Husavik Triple formed the basis for development of virtual teaching and learning activities as a deliverable from the Erasmus funded project (Erasmus+ 3DTeLC Project Summary, 2021). This model has been used for structural and geomorphological mapping using VR, replicating a walkover survey of the site on foot, whilst also taking advantage of the birds eye view afforded by the drone flight mode.\n\n\n3.5\nVirtual reality walkover survey\nThe virtual reality (VR) walkover survey, mapping and the observations that are described in this paper were undertaken by the lead author, who had no prior field experience of the site, during the development of VR based teaching materials (later detailed in section x) using the 3D model of the Husavik site. This in effect allowed a traditional field survey of the Husavik site in VR to be completed using the mapping tools, without prior field knowledge or observational bias. The methodology developed during these virtual tours of Husavik, formed the basis for the student activities and allowed a step-by-step workflow to be developed and documented, while identifying factors affected the student experience of VR. These observations helped form the basis of our proposed curriculum design based on this unique geological site. Whilst the DOM must be viewed in VR to be fully appreciated, Fig. 7 through 10\n\n\n\n show the innumerable fault features on display at this site. Identifying what features are distinguishable using the DOM in VR is key to providing a framework for how 3D structural geology models such as this can be used in an educational setting.\n\nFig. 7 presents comparison between a real world and a VR view of the site looking west-north-west over the Husavik Flatey Fault (HFF) from the main escarpment. Images within the 3D VR model were captured using the built-in camera tool. GPS coordinates were recorded for photographs taken during the 2016 field survey of the HFF allowing for an accurate comparison from the same vantage points in VR. It is clear from this snapshot captured in VR that large features viewed from distance are clearly distinguishable in the DOM when viewed with an HMD. The faulting in this area is developed in the 12.5ka pahoehoe lava flow field, the surface of which has been vertically separated by the Theistareykir escarpment from which both images have been taken. The dip-slip component of the faulting along the HFF can be easily identified in VR from the tilted slabs in the lavas running centrally through both images, as well as the 2.4ka lava front, which can be seen encroaching on the 12.5ka lava field from the far-middle-left of both images. The collapsed columnar jointing of the 12.5ka lavas can be identified in the fissures of the real-world photograph in Fig. 7a, but due to distortion of the images over the DEM these are visually less clear in VR (Fig. 7b). Similarly, the riedel shears to the middle-left of the real-world image are harder to distinguish in VR from this distance. The pahoehoe lavas in the foreground of both images Fig. 7a and b provide the clearest example of the degradation of image quality in VR when viewed closeup, compared to at a distance. This is further highlighted in Fig. 8 when viewing fault scarps and depressions in the model where the image is distorted when stretched over the DEM.\n\nFig. 9 presents examples of landforms that were identified during the virtual walkover survey. These features result from the kind of structural complexity that result from the intersection between an extensional rift zone and transform fault system. Although six features are shown in this figure, the site is covered by varied structural features of equal quality, and it is this that makes the site such a unique structural geology experience in VR. Fig. 9a shows an example of a circular depression that results from lava deflation and collapse structures. Fault mapping in this area, both in real-world and VR experiences, is complicated by the presence of these types of deflation structures in the pahoehoe flows. Fig. 9b shows the northern boundary of the younger 2.4ka lava flows from the Theistareykir volcanic centre, covering the southern edge of the DOM. These flows stop short of covering the en-echelon fault complexes trending north-west through south-east throughout the model (Fig. 9d), before buttressing against the rift zone. The eastern section of the DOM is dominated by normal faults in the Theistareykir rift zone; these form steep fault escarpments that are clearly visible in the VR (Fig. 9c and e). The model highlights the vertical displacement along the rift through the escarpment running north-south through the model. Fig. 9f shows piercing points identified in the DOM and are a key indicator of structural movement along the faults.\nThe columnar jointing that is pervasive throughout the pahoehoe flows complicated data collection in the field, obscuring piercing points and exaggerating opening amounts. (Rust and Whitworth., 2019). This is exacerbated further in VR due to issues with the resolution of the imagery used to create the 3D mode and distortion caused by the image being stretched over vertical surfaces not visible to the drone, as highlighted in Fig. 8. This makes reliable identification and measurements of these features in VR difficult and subject to greater inaccuracy than was encountered in the original field survey.\n\nFig. 10 displays the results of structural mapping undertaken by the authors using the DOM, completed in VR using the GeaVR mapping toolkit with Oculus HMD and Oculus Rift controllers. For comparison, detailed structural observations from the study area and original field survey can be found in Rust and Whitworth (2019).\nPrimary lava features such as the 2.4ka lava front encroaching from the southwest and lava deflation features within the pahoehoe lavas were mapped using the polygon tools. Faults were mapped systematically across the Husavik DOM using the line tool. Three distinct areas can be distinguished from the completed mapping, as highlighted in Fig. 10. The two main fault systems, the NW-SE transform-affinity en-echelon fault complexes of the HFF and the N\u2013S normal faults from the Theistareykir rifting, continuous with the well-developed fault scarp marking its western margin, are all clear from their consistent trend. The transform zone shows a series of left-stepping transform-affinity en-echelon fault complexes before curving into alignment with the Theistareykir rifting, highlighted in the centre of Fig. 10. Larger features from the model are easily identifiable and viewing the model in 3D helps to distinguish some features based on their topography in a way that viewing the orthomosaic in 2D cannot. It was noted in the original field study that the detailed birds eye view offered by the drone imagery proved a useful tool for mapping the spatial relationships of the tectonic deformation taking place at the triple junction, observations that at ground level were difficult to reliably differentiate from smaller faults. (Rust and Whitworth, 2019). This also translated well when viewing the Husavik DOM in VR. The drone traversal modality proved most useful to navigate and map the features across the site. The oblique view afforded by this traversal mode, as well as the ability to pan and adjust the virtual height of the observer whilst utilising the field toolkit made it the preferred choice over the fixed height or viewpoint of the other two traversal options when mapping and identifying features.\nDespite the benefits described, there were limitations that became apparent while using the DOM in VR. Firstly, as highlighted in Fig. 8, the resolution of the UAV-SfM imagery and the distortion created by the photogrammetric process over fault scarps and blockier lava features, for example, can make detailed VR field observations and measurement in these areas difficult. Therefore, it is essential that very high-resolution drone imagery is acquired, where the intention is to use this data to create a VR model. Care must be taken during the photogrammetric process used to convert the individual drone photos onto an elevation model and orthophoto mosaic. Photogrammetry and UAV-SfM surveys depend on feature matching algorithms and complex, repeating patterns (often found in complex terrains) can introduce uncertainty during this process, leading to incomplete reconstruction and or repetition of features in the final orthomosaic (Lane et al., 2000; Iglhaut et al., 2019). This can be reduced by increasing the overlap of images taken by the drone during the UAV-SfM survey and introducing more ground control points increasing location accuracy. (Westoby et al., 2012; James and Robson., 2014). Manual selection of user identified tie-points (matching areas\/features) within the imagery with high confidence will also reduce errors in the final model. Image distortion over vertical surfaces is reduced with the implementation of oblique imagery throughout the survey (Cecchi et al., 2011). These steps can be taken to reduce inaccuracies but can prove inefficient over large study areas such as this site. The original walkover study yielded 120 measurements of fault displacement between piercing points. This was supplemented by a further 80 measurements taken from the drone imagery. It was noted from the original field study (Rust and Whitworth., 2019) that due to the resolution of the imagery, the measurements taken from the orthomosaic proved to be significantly lower in quality than those taken in the field. It is then apparent that the added distortion introduced in the DOM and VR would further degrade the accuracy of any data collected.\nFrom a research point of view these limitations can affect the quality and reliability of any meaningful data collection using the DOM and are important to consider, especially for researchers intending to study these sites further in VR. However, with regard to using the Husavik DOM as a teaching tool, this does not detract from benefits previously discussed. The ability to view this complex site in VR is an immersive experience, allowing the user to clearly identify important geological structures across the site and affording the user a greater understanding of the spatial scale of these structures. This has the potential to resolve conceptual difficulties that are often encountered by students during field experiences, such as interpreting 3D structures from 2D imagery, and affords a greater understanding of the geologic relationships on display at this site (Whitmeyer et al., 2009). The addition of mapping tools such as the line, polygon and topographical cross section tool are spatially accurate and could provide an excellent introduction to mapping the area as a case study or in preparation for a real-world field trip (Paz- \u00c1lvarez et al., 2022). Academic staff will often visit the same field location year on year and, with the correct training and equipment, UAV-SfM surveys can be conducted to generate DOM's that can support pre and post field work activities using these tools.\n\n\n3.6\nImplementation for teaching\nBased on these observations we have designed a series of student activities based around use of the Husavik Triple Junction DOM in VR. Students are first asked to navigate to the top of the escarpment along the Theistareykir rift using the drone or flight traversal mode, affording them a similar view to that shown in Fig. 7 and familiarising them with the flight traversal option. The guided nature of this task and the singular location means that it can be delivered first by the lecturer, explaining the key features that are on view before the students enter the VR HMD to experience it themselves. Tasks are then introduced with each one utilising one of the key mapping tools (Fig. 6) to create a structural model containing faults and primary lava features across the site (Fig. 9). One such exercise breaks the site down into three sections examining the en-echelon fault complexes, the transform zone and the rift as outlined in Fig. 10 and utilising the line tool to measure and record faults in each area. The KML files for each session on the task are saved separately but can be merged later using GIS. Between each task regular intervals encourage breaks from using the HMD to reduce concerns surrounding motion sickness raised in 5.1.2. Likewise, each task builds upon the last, gradually increasing the students\u2019 familiarity with both the traversal modes and the toolkit, assuming a beginner level at the outset. The final task utilises the data collected in VR to help students produce their own structural map for the study site, as is shown in Fig. 10. Incorporating VR in this manner, alongside traditional GIS skills based practical sessions, provides an enhanced learning outcome and supports wider skill development.\n\n\n3.7\nCurriculum design\nOne of the principal outputs from the Erasmus\u00a0+\u00a0project involved creating a series of specific learning activities for each of the sites where imagery was collected to create DOM's for use in VR. Each site surveyed was chosen for the varied geomorphological features and structural landforms that characterized that chosen landscape.\nIn our experience, when implementing VR as part of a teaching curriculum and fieldwork activities, it is important to include the following:\n\n-\nClearly articulated learning objectives that aligned with the course module in which the activities would sit. Here we chose a postgraduate module on a geological and environmental hazards course where natural hazard processes, structural geology, fieldwork, mapping and spatial analysis form integral components of the course activities and learning outcomes.\n\n\n-\nOverview of the study area and surrounding region that provides the student with a summary of the geological setting and recent historical activity with links to published research. In our case the IVR session is preceded by an induction talk or presentation which provides context for the site. The teaching resources provides links to published research to allow for more self-directed reading and in-depth investigation to be undertaken by the students, important especially for those studying at postgraduate level.\n\n\n-\nSummary of how the DOM was created. This was an important part of the Erasmus\u00a0+\u00a0project and expands upon the overall learning outcomes from the exercise, providing insight into a growing field of study. To this end, each learning resource included a summary of the methods involving the UAV-SfM surveys, and processing of the imagery for further use in VR.\n\n\n-\nStep by step instruction on how to load, visualise and navigate the model in VR. This is described in the learning materials but could also form part of the induction session to allow students to become familiar with navigation and the use of the mapping tools available. This is to be completed before beginning the learning activities in VR.\n\n\n-\nMapping and measurement tasks. Students undertake a set of tasks specifically designed for the 3D terrain under investigation. This involves relevant use of mapping tools (point, line and polygon) and measurement tools (topographic profile, virtual camera, GPS waypoints and compass clinometer), depending on the study area and proposed learning outcomes from the chosen site. Using the Husavik Triple Junction as an example, the teaching materials principally follow the walkover survey presented in section x. Step by step students are tasked with building a structural model of the site, mapping easily identifiable features such as the 2.4ka lava front using the polygon tool and then mapping faults using the line and measurement tools. Students are directed between individual tasks to take breaks to minimise any effects of VR induced motion sickness.\n\n\n-\nInstructions for exporting data collection in VR for further analysis in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The measurements and mapped features collected in VR are exported with real-world coordinates as comma separated values (CSV) for use in a spreadsheet or data processing tool, or as KML spatial files allowing students to export these measurements into GIS software. This is an important part of the overall task as it reinforces other learning outcomes relevant geoscience courses. In the case of our Husavik teaching materials the user is tasked with building a complete structural model of the site using measurements collected in VR and preparing this data as a figure to be presented using GIS software.\n\n\n\nSessions using VR must be carefully planned with clear sight of how the activities align with the learning outcomes for the module. VR should only be included if there is a reasonable expectation it could enhance student learning and engagement (Detyna and Kadiri., 2019; Stoj\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2017). Use of VR for virtual field activities requires significant preparation, including allowing time for students to become familiar with VR and providing clear instructions that set out the aims and objectives of the session. Students have shown that without specific guidance virtual experiences can prove daunting (Dolphin et al., 2019). Task design is therefore, one of the most important considerations when developing course content using VR (Hafner et al., 2013). VR based activities should be planned as part of a broader range of activities that enhance students\u2019 skills. For example, allowing the user to export mapping and other data from VR for use in other software such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to generate new products and outputs. These initiatives can help embed interactive digital learning activities to reinforce classroom-based learning and support specific digital skill development (McGuinness and Fulton., 2019).\n\n\n3.8\nTwo-dimensional alternatives\nIt is important to consider how to provide access to the DOM's in situations where VR equipment is not available. It therefore may be necessary to provide a version of the DOM that does not require use of an HMD and controller, but only requires access to a standard computer and monitor and allows simple navigation, allowing the students to walk and fly over the site using their keyboard and mouse. This approach can be used for face-to-face teaching to large student groups in computing facilities without access to VR equipment or for remote teaching, where students are studying away from university and using their own computers in the UK or overseas. In each case the two-dimensional package can be downloaded and installed on the host computer and operated using the keyboard and mouse, allowing students to traverse the virtual terrain without the need for use of full VR equipment. This was trialed successfully using the Husavik model during a virtual conference held as part of the Erasmus\u00a0+\u00a0project. A Learning, Teaching and Training (LTT) event was held remotely as part of the 3DTeLC project during the May Covid-19 2020 global lockdowns. Students attending remotely using their own computers (at home throughout Europe), were able to download a 2D Husavik terrain model for use on both Windows and Mac and undertake a series of individual and group learning activities.\n\n\n3.9\nLearning materials\nThis teaching plan described for the Husavik site has been replicated for DOM's of geomorphological sites for other hazard landscapes, including landslides (Black Ven & Chale, UK), lava flows (Mt Etna) and coastal spits (East Head, UK). The outputs from the Erasmus+ funded project are available to download from the EU project portal (Erasmus+ 3DTeLC Project Summary, 2021) and http:\/\/www.3dtelc.com, while the GeaVR software is available at https:\/\/geavr.eu\n.\n\nThese resources include the drone-to-VR scene converter and VR viewing software, raw drone imagery, Oculus VR ready scene files created from the drone imagery and teaching materials describing learning activities for each of the virtual reality sites (including the Husavik Triple Junction site discussed herein). For each of the chosen geological sites, for which drone imagery was acquired and DOM's created, detailed learning activities were devised. These included (1) a detailed background to the site with relevant literature and maps and figures; (2) a short exploratory exercise to familiarize the student with the VR controls and the DOM; (3) a series of more detailed mapping tasks to be completed in VR using the GeaVR toolkit, and (4) data processing outside VR using data exported from the model in GIS or Microsoft Excel to present and visualise the data.\n\n\n3.10\nLimitations\nThroughout our walkover surveys in VR and preparation of teaching materials it became apparent that while IVR holds much promise there are barriers that need to be overcome if it is to be successfully implemented onto curriculum. Fully understanding these limitations is crucial for the development of effective VR based teaching materials that can be integrated onto geoscience curricula.\n\n\n3.11\nTeaching and implementation onto curriculum\n\n3.11.1\nHardware\nInvestment in hardware, upgrading computing requirements and associated cost, can be seen as the biggest initial barrier to fully implementing VR. Whilst popular consumer headsets now start from around \u00a3300 (in the case of the new Oculus Quest), outfitting a computer laboratory with enough headsets for a large class can prove prohibitively expensive. VR software is also often very graphic-intensive and requires dedicated on-board graphic cards and external onboard connections which are not always ubiquitous in campus computers, therefore utilising VR may also require upgrading existing PC hardware. Without dedicated VR laboratories, set up times mean that sessions require more preparation than normal computer based practical's and staff trained in both set-up and use of VR are needed to oversee lessons. Widespread implementation of VR onto the curriculum would require thorough planning, training and support of teaching staff (Stoj\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2017; Detyna and Kadiri., 2019). The lack of standardisation amongst VR software and technologies must also be considered. For example, the VR software and associated VR models and teaching materials in this study have been designed for use with Oculus VR equipment and have not been tested on alternative headsets. Institutions who have previously invested in other devices would need to find bespoke solutions tailored to their hardware. Concerns persist that due to the rapid technological developments in the sector, future VR headsets and operating systems will require significant changes to existing software. For example, set up times are reduced for non-dedicated VR laboratories with newer wireless VR headsets though the closed app ecosystem utilised in hardware such as the Oculus Quest.\n\n\n3.11.2\nUsability\nImplementation of VR can be viewed as positively removing pre-exisiting barriers to field exercises for those with physical disabilities or other difficulties with field-based training (Hall, 2004; Chiarella and Vurro., 2020; Bonali et al., 2019; Bonali., 2021). There are clear advantages in terms of equality and inclusivity that IVR experiences in geosciences can provide, including providing virtual access for those who physically cannot go to the field unless specific measures are implemented to enable access (Bond and Cawood., 2021). However the side effects of using VR introduces its own issues. VR has been shown to induce motion sickness in 25\u201340% of individuals (Fulvio et al., 2021) and this has also been shown to disproportionately affect gender, with women increasingly likely to experience VR motion induced sickness (Munafo et al., 2016). Beyond optimisation of software there are steps to reduce the likelihood of VR induced motion sickness, such as tailored VR personalisation and self-regulating movement and rotation when using HMD, methods that are difficult to control in a classroom environment. Care needs be taken when creating any assessment that relies upon use of VR, as this would negatively impact those who are unable to use VR effectively for these reasons.\n\n\n3.11.3\nDigital literacy\nStudents arriving at university have varying levels of digital literacy and often do not have the computing skills needed to solve scientific problems (Shopova, 2014). Those who struggle with standard geoscience computer applications will undoubtedly experience similar difficulties with VR due to the added complexity and physicality. VR use prior to higher education varies significantly amongst students and often, due to the lack of implementation in early education, depends on the personal experience of the user with VR, most commonly with computer gaming. There is a strong association between previous IT experience and gaming that informs how well students will perceive and engage with VR based activities (Wright., 2022; Bursztyn et al., 2022). These disparities can be overcome by embedding VR throughout the curriculum so students become proficient in their use. Through careful support and scaffolding at a module level, students need time with VR to allow for exploration and discovery to better embrace these experiences. (Wright et al., 2022; Detyna and Kadiri., 2019). As with all new technology, each of these issues may fade as time goes by and VR and HMD's become more commonly used in areas inside and outside pre-higher education (Pantelidis, 2010). As such and following recommendations regarding motion sickness in 5.1.2. VFT's using VR should be designed without assessment to remain broadly applicable (Barth et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nField mapping experience is a critical part of any structural geological teaching, and learning can only take place where students are exposed to real world examples of different structural features and landforms. Fieldwork is typically planned to support classroom teaching and provide students with these opportunities. Students can sometimes find themselves struggling to identify features in the field due to a lack of spatial skills and the difficulty of conceptualizing space and scale (Kastens et al., 2009; Liben and Titus., 2012). Whilst there is an increasing trend of encouraging the use of mobile technology in the field, measurements and apps that replicate compass clinometers fail to solve this issue (Cawood et al., 2017). Similarly, this difficulty conceptualizing space and scale is not solved by traditional fieldwork preparation and reconnaissance using two-dimensional satellite imagery (Bursztyn et al., 2022). Visualising the three-dimensional nature of geological structures, the intersection of geological structures with topography and the extrapolation of small-scale features into larger scales are common issues faced when learning from traditional two-dimensional imagery (Whitmeyer et al., 2009). Studies show that users of IVR can more accurately perceive spatial properties than in non-immersive VR and that the understanding of spatial relationships is enhanced within this setting. (Schnabel and Kvan., 2003; Lukacevic et al., 2020). If implemented onto the curriculum correctly, IVR has the potential to reduce the performance gap between students with high and low spatial abilities (Simpson et al., 2017; Bursztyn et al., 2022).\nThe 3DTeLC Erasmus\u00a0+\u00a0project's Learning, Teaching and Training (LTT) events were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic that took hold in March 2020 and led to significant disruption to classroom and field-based teaching activities. Norms for data collection, teaching, research and dissemination have all been challenged by the pandemic and resulting travel restrictions and limits on group activities have severely limited national and international fieldwork opportunities for students. So, any virtual technique that can help provide an alternative when fieldwork is curtailed in this manner will be beneficial as travel restrictions are often introduced with little notice and alternatives are required quickly in response. The impact of fieldwork on climate change is also now under greater scrutiny, yet many courses in geosciences involve an element of student field work that still requires air travel, one of the most carbon intensive forms of travel (Macintosh and Wallace., 2009). While universities actively aim to reduce emissions, few attempts have been made to limit the impact of long distance travel involved in international student mobility (Arsenault et al., 2019). There will be increasing pressure for the academic sector as a whole to reduce its own carbon footprint (Higham and Font., 2019). Increasing student numbers in higher education and stretching of departmental resources (Dolphin et al., 2019) puts pressure on geoscience curricula to find alternatives to international field work or to minimise time spent on overseas field visits. Overseas fieldwork while considered a key component of many geoscience courses, is often expensive and students are increasingly having to self-fund trips at undergraduate level (Giles et al., 2020).\nBeing able to transport students to field sites through VR, without ever having to leave the classroom would appear to solve many of these issues. However, while students are intrigued by the developments with the technology, they may be unlikely to fully accept IVR experiences as a replacement for actual field work (Cliffe, 2017; Paz- \u00c1lvarez et al., 2022; Wright., 2022). Younger users would appear to be less impressed by VR (Bonali., 2021), having had more exposure to its capabilities in other platforms such as gaming. Therefore it may be that VR applications need to be defined better to tailor towards younger audiences rather than researchers and academics. While the benefits of 3D learning are clear (Whitelock and Jelfs., 2005; Bond and Cawood., 2021), the desire still for hands on field experience would seem to warrant VR's place on geosciences curricula, not as a replacement for fieldwork in its current form, but as a tool to help students develop their spatial understanding and existing fieldwork skills, increase critical analytical skills and provide unique experience that can enhance graduate career prospects (Bos et al., 2021; Paz- \u00c1lvarez et al., 2022; Bursztyn et al., 2022). Advantages of using VR as a part of existing fieldwork plans include their use as part of pre-fieldwork site orientation, induction and health and safety overview; and post-fieldwork debriefing and subsequent formative and summative feedback.\nWhile interest in educational VR applications remains high (Bonali et al., 2021), they are often underutilised and research thoroughly describing how VR based teaching can be adopted into the curriculum is uncommon (Radianti et al., 2020; Klippel et al., 2019). This Erasmus+ funded project aimed to tackle this shortcoming by developing the software and workflows required to generate VR models from raw drone imagery, establish a database of VR models for different geological settings and develop a range of teaching materials, videos and learning activities to compliment these VR models that are aligned to learning outcomes of standard undergraduate and postgraduate geoscience modules.\nThere are significant advantages to teaching using IVR and sites that are impractical for student visitation become alive in a virtual space that traditional 2D teaching cannot replicate without field work. 3D learning provides enhanced learning outcomes over similar methods currently delivered in 2D, helping students contextualise space and further develops spatial skills (Bond and Cawood., 2021). Though it is unlikely that students would accept VR as a replacement for real world experiences, existing fieldwork preparation and case studies can be enhanced using VR if implemented in a way that complements the existing curriculum, either utilising the 3DTeLC database of field sites, converting existing orthomosaics or through the development of new models. Following the workflow presented in the case study, DOM's can be generated that can help develop teaching materials for future student year groups.\nImplementation of IVR experiences requires careful planning of what students can reasonably be asked to achieve in the timeframe of typical 1\u20132\u00a0h practical sessions. In structuring tasks, the learning outcomes need to be clearly defined and met during these sessions to warrant VR's inclusion (Hafner et al., 2013; Detyna and Kadiri, 2019). IVR provides many exciting opportunities for new ways to observe and interact with 3D earth models created from high quality imagery. These novel techniques are providing researchers with exciting new tools to study geological sites and innovative ways to disseminate the information (Marshall and Higley, 2021; Mahan et al.,. 2021). However, the \u2018reality\u2019 of introducing VR as a core component of any taught curriculum is complex. Questions remain on how effectively it can be implemented onto geoscience courses due to the obstacles highlighted in this paper. No doubt as technology improves and becomes cheaper to implement, IVR will be a useful tool for academics and researchers to incorporate with pre-existing methods of learning and visualization.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nComplex geological sites like the Husavik Triple Junction in remote locations such as northern Iceland are often too costly, too inaccessible, or simply dangerous for students to visit. Given the rising demand for online digital resources, blended learning in higher education, and rising costs of fieldwork in geosciences in particular (Giles et al., 2020), alternatives that can provide or support the learning outcomes of traditional fieldwork are more important than ever. Three-dimensional learning using VR can provide enhanced learning outcomes over similar classroom-based methods when devised carefully (Hafner et al., 2013), helping students contextualise space and further develop spatial skills (Bursztyn et al., 2022). It is unlikely that students would accept VR as a replacement for real world experiences (Bond and Cawood., 2021), but existing fieldwork preparation and case studies can be enhanced using IVR if implemented in a way that complements the existing curriculum, either by utilising an existing database of DOM's, or by converting DOM's for use in VR.\nThe Husavik Triple Junction DOM presented in this study shows that while the quality of these 3D models are currently not sufficient enough for researchers on a site of this scale for thorough data collection, their use as an educational tool, especially when paired with VR to create an immersive experience, has an important role to play on existing geoscience curricula. Implementation of IVR activities based on DOM's of geological sites, replicating traditional fieldwork techniques, requires careful planning and should include pre-sessional orientation and induction, while allowing time for students to become familiar with VR hardware and software (Wright,. 2022).\nIVR provides many exciting opportunities for new ways for students to observe and interact with Earth. These novel techniques provide students with new tools to study geological sites and innovative ways for academics to disseminate information. Importantly, as more remote geological sites are surveyed and the DOM's made publicly available, VR provides an opportunity for students to visit these localities in a more immersive way than traditional VFT's. From this, remote geological sites will become increasingly accessible to students opening huge opportunities for increasing the range and quality of students' virtual field experiences and giving them the essential preparatory skills to conduct real world fieldwork.\n\n\nFunding\nErasmus+ Key Action 2 funded project 2017-1-UK01-KA203-036719 3DTeLC-Bringing the 3Dworld into the classroom: a new approach to Teaching, Learning and Communicating the science of geohazards in terrestrial and marine environments coordinated by M.

Centrifuge analog modeling has historically been used to simulate salt detached fold-and-thrust belt systems using few cm-wide squeeze boxes (e.g., Koyi, 1988; Mulugeta, 1988; Liu and Dixon, 1990; Dixon and Tirrul, 1991; Dixon and Liu, 1992; Waffle et al., 2016) or large centrifuges hosting tens of cm-wide models (Noble and Dixon, 2011). More recently, Milazzo and co-authors (2021) compared centrifuge and analog models where thrust wedges formed over frictional to low-frictional basal detachments. The main features of thrust wedges underlain by a low-strength basal weak layer are (e.g., Davis and Engelder, 1987; Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Luj\u00e1n et al., 2003): (i) lower critical tapers, (ii) opposite fold and thrust vergence, and (iii) rapid localization of the deformation front along the outer d\u00e9collement pinch-out. Most analog models analyzing the effect of such d\u00e9collements on thrust wedges have been conducted under a normal gravity field due to simpler setups and wider range of choice when considering dimensions and geometries (e.g., Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Graveleau et al., 2012 and references therein). These settings, however, show limitations, especially regarding the rheology and mechanical behavior of both the d\u00e9collement (silicone polymers) and the cover (loose sand) levels. In particular, the brittle behavior of the latter prevents studying some particular effects such as the occurrence of buckle folds in the hanging wall of thrusts and their influence in the amount of total shortening along strike. In order to broaden the range of experimental materials (and behaviors) able to simulate sedimentary rocks, in this work we conduct experiments under higher vertical gravity by means of a centrifuge device, a technique used since the pioneering works of Ramberg in the sixties (Ramberg, 1963; 1967a,b) and developed thereafter (e.g., Koyi, 1988; Mulugeta, 1988; Liu and Dixon, 1990; Dixon and Spratt, 2004; Godin et al., 2011; Noble and Dixon, 2011).\nPrevious works studying experimental thrust wedges overlying a low-strength d\u00e9collement have investigated a wide range of parameters playing a major role in their structural style. These parameters can be classified into the following groups. (1) Along- and\/or across-strike changes on the properties of the basal d\u00e9collement, mainly due to the presence of lateral and\/or frontal pinch-outs of the viscous layer (e.g., Calassou et al., 1993; Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Schreurs et al., 2001; Turrini et al., 2001; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Luj\u00e1n et al., 2003; Vidal-Royo et al., 2009; Milazzo et al., 2021). (2) Convergence velocity, because of the dependence of the effective viscosity of the d\u00e9collement on the strain rate (e.g., Davis et al., 1983; Liu and Dixon, 1990; Weijermars et al., 1993; ten Grotenhuis et al., 2002; Luj\u00e1n et al., 2006). (3) The convergence direction, whose perpendicularity or obliquity to the backstop results in different structural patterns (e.g., Lickorish et al., 2002; Soto et al., 2006; Crespo-Blanc, 2008). (4) Presence of an only or several interbedded viscous layers and\/or stratigraphic thickness variations (e.g., Letouzey et al., 1995; Corrado et al., 1998; Couzens-Schultz et al., 2003; Massoli et al., 2006; Storti et al., 2007; Santolaria et al., 2015; Borderie et al., 2018). (5) Syntectonic sedimentation and\/or erosion (e.g., Smit et al., 2010; Darnault et al., 2016; Pla et al., 2019). (6) Interaction of two indenters acting successively or simultaneously (e.g., Munteanu et al., 2014; Soto et al., 2020). (7) the mechanical stratigraphy overlaying the basal d\u00e9collement (e.g., Liu and Dixon, 1990; Dixon and Tirrul, 1991; Noble and Dixon, 2011; Waffle et al., 2016). In this work, we investigate the role played by different pre-contractional thickness changes (i.e., forelandward, lateral and forelandward-oblique cover thinning) on the structural architecture of salt-detached fold-and-thrust belts. In order to isolate variables, and to define the ductile flow pattern without lateral anisotropies, thickness changes imposed on the geometry of the d\u00e9collement were gradual and there were not lateral pinch-outs. Using a well-stablished centrifuge modelling protocol (see Yakymchuk et al., 2012), our experimental program represents an innovative approach, in terms of set-up geometries and modelling materials to give clues for interpreting compressional salt tectonics in environments with varying sedimentary cover thickness to salt d\u00e9collement thickness ratios. A \u201c4D\u201d view of the development of structures was achieved by visualizing the interior of the analog models using computed tomodensitometry (CT scanning, e.g., Ramberg, 1981; Dixon and Summers, 1985; Yakymchuk et al., 2012). Modeling results are discussed and compared to the South Central Pyrenean salient.\n\n\n2\nMethodology: centrifuge analog modeling\n\n2.1\nRationale\nThe presence of a tapered low-strength d\u00e9collement at the base of a pre-orogenic, also tapered sedimentary cover sequence determines the geometry, kinematics and structural style of fold-and-thrust belts (e.g., Storti et al., 2007). Both factors (i.e., low-strength d\u00e9collement and pre-tectonic thickness variations) are very common in nature, and usually occur simultaneously, conditioned by the paleogeography of sedimentary basins. Nevertheless, they have been analyzed separately in most cases (e.g., Liu et al., 1992; Macedo and Marshak, 1999; Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Soto et al., 2002).\nPrevious centrifuge analog models aimed testing different parameters such as the influence of pre-existing salt bodies (Koyi, 1988), the basal friction (Mulugeta, 1988; Milazzo et al., 2021) or the mechanical stratigraphy (Liu and Dixon, 1990: Dixon and Tirrul, 1991; Dixon and Liu, 1992; Noble and Dixon, 2011; Yakymchuk et al., 2012; Waffle et al., 2016) but, as a common feature, they considered a layer-cake mechanical stratigraphy. Our experimental program is designed to study the influence of pre-orogenic thickness variations on the structural architecture and ductile flow patterns of thrust wedges. These variations can involve both the basal d\u00e9collement and the sedimentary cover and different 2D patterns, such as forelandward-thinning, lateral-thinning and forelandward-oblique-thinning, or tridimensional variations. The advantage of centrifuge analog models resides in its versatility to use different low-density and viscous materials in order to replicate ductile deformation or folding at different levels within the crust (e.g., Dixon and Summers 1985; Dixon and Tirrul 1991; Hill et al., 2010; Yakymchuk et al., 2012; Waffle et al., 2016). Waffle and coauthors (2016) explore the physical characteristics and rheology of different analog materials to-be-used in centrifuge analog modelling. Among the different possibilities, our experimental program incorporates a material not commonly used previously, Moon Sand\u2122, a polymer\/sand mixture suitable to simulate upper crust brittle sedimentary sequences in centrifuge models (Waffle et al., 2016).\nWe started the modeling series through a simple experimental scenario to investigate the response of this material to shortening under increased gravity fields. Hence, our experimental program involves three series of experiments: a constant thickness cover detached over a frictional base (Series 1), a constant-thickness series underlain by a ductile d\u00e9collement (Series 2) that sets the basis to then perform tapered cover-d\u00e9collement experiments (Series 3). The rationale behind series 1 and 2 is not to revisit the kinematics and structural styles of frictional and salt-detached fold-and-thrust belts, widely known from natural examples (e.g., Hessami et al., 2001; Barnes et al., 2010), sandbox analog (e.g., Liu et al., 1992; Costa and Vendeville, 2002) and numerical modeling (Ruh et al., 2012; Buiter et al., 2016), but rather to set the foundations of orogenic wedging using Moon Sand\u2122. These models are the pillars that sustain more complex models (Series 3) and ensure the reliability of comparison between our results and previous works.\n\n\n2.2\nMaterial characterization and scaling parameters\nCentrifuge analog modeling permits the use of several analog materials to simulate the upper crust rocks, such as the Demco\u00ae modelling clay, Dow Corning Dilatant Compound 3179, Crayola\u00ae Model Magic and plasticine building microlaminates (Waffle et al., 2016). Microlaminates, for example, simulate successions of clastic and carbonate rocks interbedded with pelitic rocks (Yakymchuk et al., 2012). The Moon Sand\u2122 consists of regular, fine-grained quartz sand coated with polymer and synthetic rubber binders. There are two different kinds of Moon Sand\u2122, regular (density of 1510\u00a0kg\/m3) and light (density of 600\u00a0kg\/m3). They are mixable materials and so the density of the layers can be modified mixing different proportions of each type. This allows for horizontal and vertical density variations (a crucial property in gravity-enhanced experiments) within the cover sequence (Santolaria et al., 2016b). Interlayering thin layers of lighter Moon Sand\u2122 within a regular Moon Sand\u2122 sequence also enhances the visibility of the brittle sequence layering in tomodensitometry scans. Moon Sand\u2122 has been proved to be an effective analog of the brittle upper-crust rocks after developing suitably scaled structures, such as folds, thrusts, tensional fractures, and strike-slip faults (Waffle, 2016). In order to go further into the characterization of this material and its suitability for our series of experiments, we performed several shear tests. Regular shear test carried out for quartz sands used in sandbox analog modeling are usually performed under 0\u201325\u00a0kPa normal loads (Schellart, 2000; Ellis et al., 2004), although shear tests for determining mechanical properties of sand also use relatively high normal loads (50, 100, 150\u00a0kPa). In our case, shear tests were carried out considering normal loads that emulate the centrifuge force scenario: an 8\u00a0mm thick Moon Sand\u2122 layer can exert a normal stress of 125\u00a0kPa when accelerated up to 8820\u00a0m\/s2 (898g). Moon Sand\u2122 shear tests exhibited a first stage of viscoelastic deformation, then a plastic strain hardening stage that ends at the peak strength, yield point. As deformation continues, shear strength remains stable (dynamic stable friction) (Fig. 1\na). Occasionally, after peak strength, a plastic softening stage may be inferred from the 5\u00a0kPa fall in the 200\u00a0kPa load curve (Fig. 1a). The correlation between normal and shear stress for different experiments is close to the ideal Coulomb behavior with a cohesion value of 6.4\u00a0kPa and an angle of internal friction of 17.3\u00b0 (Fig. 1b). In spite of showing values lower than those assumed for the upper crust according to Byerlee's law, this behavior is more realistic when considering deeper levels within the crust, semi-brittle materials, high pore pressure or higher geothermal gradients, or in terms of contrast between the upper (brittle) crust and lower (ductile) crust than in the case of sandbox models, where the interface between the two layers is responsible for many of the features found in both extensional and compressional settings (see, e.g. Chester, 1995; Kohlstedt et al., 1995; Bos and Spiers, 2002).\n\nD\u00e9collement units are here simulated by silicone putty (Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty\u2122, CATP\u2122) whose density is 1068\u00a0kg\/m3 (Waffle et al., 2016). To ensure consistency we systematically used green and blue polymers having a density of 1050\u00a0kg\/m3. At relatively high strain rates (>ca. 10\u22122 s\u22121), this silicone putty shows a strain rate-dependent viscosity (Poulin, 2006; Yakymchuk et al., 2012; Waffle, 2015), and therefore it behaves as a non-Newtonian material. However, at strain rates below ca. 10\u22122 s\u22121, the effective viscosity is constant (Waffle, 2015). Regarding that the estimated experimental strain rates in centrifuge analog modeling are close to 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 s\u22121, nearly two orders of magnitude below the aforementioned threshold, it can be considered that CATP\u2122 behaves as a Newtonian material whose viscosity is approximately 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u22125\u00a0Pa\/s (Yakymchuk et al., 2012; Waffle et al., 2016).\nThe experimental package lies directly on a plastic sheet that represents the top of an undeformable basement (Fig. 2\n). In experiments where a constant-thickness sedimentary sequence is considered (Series 1 and 2), this plastic sheet represents the base of the modelling setup. In experiments considering tapered sequences (Series 3), the plastic sheet lies over a molded basement simulated by Y2 Clay (modeling clay) (Fig. 2). Y2 Clay is a viscoelastic material, with a very high viscosity (<1010\u00a0Pa\u00b7s), at shear rates less than 10 s\u22121 (Waffle et al., 2006). This material is relatively easy to mold when heated but behaves as an elastic solid at room temperature, both under natural gravity conditions or under an applied centrifuge force. Hence, this allows creating a broad range of non-deformable basement geometries simulating, for example, rigid crystalline basements (Waffle et al., 2006).\nModels are designed to simulate a simplified fold-and-thrust belt system. To guarantee a reliable comparison between models and nature, the geometry of the models, the mechanical properties of the analog materials and the dynamic and kinematics of experiments were scaled following well-stablished scaling principles (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1967a, b, 1973, 1981; Dixon and Summers, 1985; Weijermars et al., 1993) that are summarized in Table 1\n. The model to nature ratio for length is 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, which represents that 1\u00a0mm in our models is equivalent to 1\u00a0km in nature. Since our models are run under enhanced gravity, the model (centrifuge acceleration of 8820\u00a0m\/s2) to nature (natural gravity, 9.8\u00a0m\/s2) ratio for gravity corresponds to 898. Being aware of the variability of rock densities in nature, we assumed an average value for the volumetric mass of the sedimentary cover (limestones and siliciclastic rocks) of about 2600\u00a0kg\/m3, and a mean volumetric mass for salt of about 2200\u00a0kg\/m3 (e.g., Jackson and Talbot, 1986). Considering the mean density of our analog material, 1510\u00a0kg\/m3 for the Moon Sand\u2122 and 1050\u00a0kg\/m3 for the CATP\u2122 silicone putty, the scaling ratio for densities is 0.58 and 0.49 for the sedimentary cover and the salt d\u00e9collement, respectively. Considering the basic scaling principles, the model to nature ratio for stress \u03c3*, corresponds to:\n\n\u03c3*\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c1*\u00b7g*\u00b7L*\n\n\n\nWhere \u03c1*, g* and L* are the model-to-prototype ratio for the density, gravity acceleration, and length. Calculated stresses for models and nature are 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0Pa and 2.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107, respectively.\nThe strain ratio is calculated from the viscosity ratio (\u03b7*) based on calculation considering variable viscosities of CATP\u2122, ranging from 104\u00a0Pa\u00b7s (Waffle et al., 2006) and 105\u00a0Pa\u00b7s (Yakymchuk et al., 2012), and rock salt (1017\u20131019\u00a0Pa\u00b7s, average\u00a0=\u00a01018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s, e.g., Jackson et al., 1994; Van Keken et al., 1993) and the stress ratio \u03c3*, as follows:\n\n\u03b5*\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3*\/ \u03b7*\n\n\n\nDue to the variability of viscosities, strain rate ratio ranges from 2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 and 2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012.\n\n\n2.3\nDesign, set-up, and experimental procedure\nOur analog models simulate a contractional system detached along a frictional base or a d\u00e9collement. Experiments were carried out at the \u201cLaboratoire de simulation physique, g\u00e9ophysique et num\u00e9rique\u201d of the INRS-ETE (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) and, in this work, we present a selection of models that represent the culmination of more than 60 initial test models (not illustrated herein) needed to set the proper protocol for building and running centrifuge models using Moon Sand\u2122. This selection includes 15 models which are grouped in three series of experiments. Series 1 involved a horizontal, homogeneous layer-cake cover detached on a frictional surface. In Series 2 a similar cover is underlain by a 3\u00a0mm-thick CATP\u2122 silicone layer. The d\u00e9collement extends from the backstop to a distal pinch-out and laterally changes to Moon Sand\u2122 to fill the whole length of the models (Table 2\n). Above it, a layered sequence of colored Moon Sand\u2122 is placed. Tested parameter in Series 1 and 2 are the thickness of the cover (3\u20139\u00a0mm thick in series 1; 3\u201312\u00a0mm thick in series 2, Table 2). Finally, Series 3 consists of models featuring forelandward (Series 3.1), along-strike (Series 3.2) and forelandward-oblique (Series 3.3) tapered covers underlain by a d\u00e9collement (see Table 2). Within each of these sub-series, the geometry of the cover remains constant while the thickness of the d\u00e9collement varies from constant thickness to tapered geometries (Table 2). The top surface of the models is always flat and horizontal and so the thickness of the d\u00e9collement layer is controlled by the geometry of the Y2 Clay basement. Note that the differential thickness within each model can result in differential loading enhanced by the centrifugal force, in a way similar to differential loading occurring in nature triggering, for example, salt migration in the d\u00e9collement during the compressional evolution of the fold-and-thrust belt.\nThe deformation box consists of a hard-plastic holder whose dimensions (constrained by the centrifuge rig capacity) are 95\u00a0mm wide and 200\u00a0mm long. A flexible plastic sheet closes the base of the holder. The modeling package extends 160\u00a0mm from the backstop and lies directly on top of the basal flexible plastic sheet (Series 1 and 2) or on top of a Y2Clay basement covered by an extra-flexible plastic sheet (Series 2, Fig. 2). The pinch-out of the d\u00e9collement is located either 155\u00a0mm (Series 2) or 140\u00a0mm (Series 3, Fig. 2) away from the backstop. In models involving a d\u00e9collement (Series 2 and 3, Table 2), the CATP\u2122 silicone was shaped using automatic (Series 2) or manual (Series 3) rollers. To track the silicone flow, the ductile layer was made by alternating strips of CATP\u2122 silicone of different colors though having similar density and rheology. On top of the basal plastic sheet (series 1) or the d\u00e9collement (series 2 and 3, Fig. 2), the layered regular Moon Sand\u2122 sequence consists of a stack of individual layers of different color allowing to image the internal deformation of models. Colored sands have the same mechanical properties. In Models 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, layering included thin, density-contrasted, light Moon Sand\u2122 to enhance its visualization in 3D tomodensitometry Scans. These thin layers of light Moon Sand\u2122 do not influence the mechanical stratigraphy of the experimental packages. The coating silicone and rubber binders that link the sand allow handling each layer individually and placing the model in vertical position, as required by the centrifuge rotor. On top of the surface of models, a pattern of circles and, in some cases, lines, were drawn using marker pen ink. To prevent border effects related to the friction between the modeling sequence and the sidewalls, we lubricated this contact by adding CATP\u2122 silicone coats, a technique that is also used in sandbox analog modeling (Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Santolaria et al., 2015).\nModels were run in the rotor of a PR-7000 centrifuge, adapted for geological modeling, that rotates at 2000\u00a0rpm, which represents a centrifuge force of 898 times the normal gravity acceleration (8820\u00a0m\/s2). To assure an even distribution of this centrifuge acceleration, analog models have a curved shape which corresponds to a circumference arc of 57\u00b0 (given a radius of the centrifuge device of 200\u00a0mm). Shortening is accomplished through a Demco\u00ae modeling clay wedge that collapses under the centrifuge force (collapsing wedge, Fig. 2) and pushes a rigid backstop that in its turn shortens the modeling package (e.g., Dixon and Summers, 1985; Dixon and Tirrul, 1991; Johns and Mosher, 1996; Harris et al., 2012; Milazzo et al., 2021). The experimental model is shortened in 4\u20136 stages, each of them lasting 360\u00a0s with a run-up time of 60\u00a0s and slow-down time of 420\u00a0s. During each stage, the amount of shortening in controlled by a linear correlation between the mass of new material added to the collapsing wedge and the horizontal displacement:\n\nShortening\u00a0=\u00a0mass \/ (\u03c1DC x A)\n\nWhere \u03c1DC is the density of the collapsing wedge material (DowCorning) and A is the area of the backstop.\n\n\n2.4\nProtocol and techniques to analyze the experiments\nQuantitative methods for analyzing the ongoing experiments include: i) oblique and top-view step-by-step photographs, and ii) computed tomodensitometry scans allowing 4D characterization of models corresponding to series 3.3 (Models 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). Besides, at the end of each experiment, models were serially sliced to better characterize their internal geometry. The use of Moon Sand\u2122 and CATP\u2122 permitted an easy and simple slicing using just a sharp cutting tool which did not require any special model treatment such as freezing, hardening, or watering.\nThe analysis of oblique and top-view photographs permits to visualize the morphometric evolution of the model and, assisted by the ink pattern drawn on the top of the model, to interpret the location, spacing and lateral extent of structures. This pattern is also used to quantify strain by comparing the final ellipses with their original circular shape (Marques and Cobbold, 2002). In addition, the linear pattern and the orientation of ellipses allows detecting and quantifying vertical axis rotations. Computed tomodensitometry scans (helical X-ray computed tomography also known as CT scanning) is a powerful, non-invasive, visualization technique, that has been proved to be a valuable approach to study the 4D evolution of analog models both in sandbox (e.g., Schreurs et al., 2003; Callot et al., 2012) and centrifuge (e.g., Yakymchuk et al., 2012) experiments. This technique can produce sections in any direction and depth at different stages of the experiment. For further details about X-ray CT scans see Ketcham and Carlson (2001), Mees et al. (2003), and Poulin (2006). Models of series 3.3 we scanned using this technique.\nModels of Series 1, 2, 3.1 and 3.2 were serially sliced and documented by high resolution cameras. No CT scans were performed on these models. Serial cross sections allow analyzing the internal architecture of the shortened model, to reconstruct the dominant flow pattern of the d\u00e9collement and to assess layer parallel shortening (LPS) by comparing the final and initial line lengths. From cross-section interpretation, we also carried out a migration-inflation analysis of the d\u00e9collement by comparing the misfit between an idealized planar slab of silicone and its actual areal distribution.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nSeries 1, frictional thrust wedges\nIn this series, a layer-cake Moon Sand\u2122 sequence occupies the whole length of the model and no viscous d\u00e9collement is considered. In the three models of this series, upon shortening, a thrust wedge formed, and material is accreted to the thrust wedge in hanging wall sequence as several imbricates (Fig. 3\n). At the end of the experiment, models display a hinterland characterized by steeply dipping thrusts and backthrusts (Fig. 3b), a thrust wedge consisting of several foreland-verging thrust units and an undeformed foreland. A backthrust develops at the rear part of the model, a typical feature in bi-vergent wedges in sandbox experiments (e.g., Storti et al., 2000, 2001) (Fig. 3c). Beyond the hinterland, the thrust wedge shows forward-verging structures and minor, secondary backthrusts (Fig. 3b). No deformation reached the foreland where layers maintain their original thickness. From the tip of the deformation front to the backstop, the thickness of Moon Sand\u2122 layers progressively increase (Fig. 3b). Critical thrust wedge taper angles attain approximately 10\u00b0 (Fig. 3b) consistently with relationships between wedge taper and friction angles found in experiments under normal gravity (Gao et al., 2018). LPS attain up to more than 90%. Differences between these models arise regarding the spacing and number of thrusts, and the width of the thrust wedge. The thicker the cover a smaller number of thrusts occur, and the width of the thrust wedge varies from ca. 50\u00a0mm, 65\u00a0mm and 85\u00a0mm in Models 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, having original stratigraphic thicknesses of 3\u00a0mm, 6\u00a0mm, and 9\u00a0mm, respectively. As in sandpacks models (e.g., Mulugeta, 1988; Liu et al., 1992; Marshak and Wilkerson, 1992; Boyer, 1995; Corrado et al., 1998), an almost linear relationship between the thickness of the brittle cover and the spacing of thrust sheets exists.\n\n\n3.2\nSeries 2, \u201csalt\u201d-detached, layer-cake thrust wedges\nSeries 2 involves models characterized by a layer-cake stratigraphy in which Moon Sand\u2122 lays over a viscous d\u00e9collement made of CATP\u2122. In Models 2.3 and 2.2, shortening is accommodated by the formation of a series of box-folds that occasionally evolve into thrusts (Fig. 4\na and b) and a frontal thrust (Model 2.2, Fig. 4b). Conversely, in Model 2.1 (Fig. 4c), where the cover is significantly thinner with respect to the other models and in relation to the d\u00e9collement, the structural style is characterized by an uneven distribution of the contractional deformation: isoclinal folds with steeply dipping to overturned flanks are localized towards the foreland while a broadly subhorizontal panel lying on top of an inflated d\u00e9collement occurs in the hinterland. The number of structures increases with decreasing cover thickness (Fig. 4). Contrasting with models of Series 1 (frictional thrust wedges), models of Series 2 do not show a dominant vergence and display very low taper angles (<1\u00b0, Fig. 4).\nLPS can be calculated in each case from the deformation of the originally circular markers on the top of the model and the line-length analysis of cross-sections. LPS is strongly dependent upon the sedimentary cover\/d\u00e9collement (SC\/D) thickness ratio, being higher in the case of thicker covers: Models 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, with ratios of 1, 3 and 4, register LPS values of 1%, 17% and 58%, respectively.\n\n\n3.3\nSeries 3, tapered \u201csalt\u201d-detached thrust wedges\nUpper surface views of models with a forelandward cover thinning (series 3.1, Table 2) showing the mobilized salt contour map and the representative section of Model 3.1.3 are shown in Fig. 5\na, b and c, respectively. A frontal thrust with significant displacement, nucleated at the d\u00e9collement pinch-out, accommodates most of the shortening (Fig. 5c). Migration of the d\u00e9collement towards the foreland accompanies the progressive translation of this frontal thrust (Fig. 5b). In the hinterland, a gentle anticline cored by the d\u00e9collement layer formed close to the backstop. This structural style and migration patterns characterize all models with forelandward thinning covers regardless of the thickness (Model 3.1.1 vs Model 3.1.2, Table 2) or the geometry of the d\u00e9collement (Model 3.1.2 vs Model 3.1.3). Measured LPS is approximately 19% (Model 3.1.3).\nExperiments of Series 3.2 are represented by Model 3.2.3 (Fig. 6\n). Along-strike thickness variations entailed significant lateral changes in the structural style of the \u201csalt\u201d-detached thrust wedges; thicknesses (and thickness ratio) of the d\u00e9collement-cover sequence controlled the number of structures (Fig. 6a and b) and the amount of displacement at the frontal thrust (Fig. 6c). Where the d\u00e9collement-cover sequence is thickest, two gentle anticlines or box-folds formed (Fig. 6c, \u201cy\u201d section), whereas where the d\u00e9collement-cover is thinnest, up to four folds formed (Fig. 6a, \u201cx\u201d cross-section). Half of these structures propagated laterally showing a curved shape in plan-view and others merged or died out along strike. This curved shape is associated with counterclockwise vertical axis rotations of to 27\u00b0 (Fig. 6a). Along-strike differential displacement of the frontal thrust resulted in an arc-shaped front. As occurring in models with forelandward thinning of the d\u00e9collement-cover sequence, the d\u00e9collement accumulated in the core of anticlines. Another diagnostic feature of models showing along-strike thickness variations was the lateral migration of the basal d\u00e9collement from thicker cover to thinner cover sectors (Fig. 6b). This effect is enhanced when the d\u00e9collement is thicker (Model 3.2.2) and when it shows a pre-contractional lateral thinning in the same sense as the cover (Model 3.2.3). In these models, LPS also varies along strike being approximately 31% and 39% from the thin to the thick d\u00e9collement-cover areas.\nThe 4D structural evolution of the 3D tapered models (Series 3.3) is illustrated, stage by stage, by top-views, CT scan sections and mobilized d\u00e9collement contour maps of Model 3.3.3 (Table 2, Fig. 7\n). At the onset of contraction (Fig. 7, Stage 1), shortening is mostly accommodated by LPS with the exception of incipient folding of the cover along the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area (CT scan section, x1, Fig. 7). Traverse d\u00e9collement migration occurs from the thicker d\u00e9collement-cover area towards the hinterland, close to the backstop (mobilized contour map in Stage 1, Fig. 7). After 42\u00a0mm of shortening (23%), deformation is differentially distributed: (i) along the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area, shortening is mainly accommodated by a set of five folds (structures labelled 1 to 5, Fig. 7, Stage 2), depicting a structural spacing of about 11\u00a0mm, whereas (ii) along the thicker d\u00e9collement-cover area a single frontal thrust develops (structure labelled 7, Fig. 7, Stage 2). This frontal thrust, together with its related hanging wall anticline (structure labelled 6, Fig. 7, Stage 2), extends laterally and dies out close to the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area, where a gentle anticline occurs on top of the d\u00e9collement pinch-out (Fig. 7, CT scan section \u00d72 and y2). Along the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area, passive black ink markers reveal up to 10\u00b0 of counterclockwise vertical axis rotation. At this time, d\u00e9collement migrates centrifugally from the center of the thrust wedge and the thicker d\u00e9collement-cover area towards the hinterland, the foreland and the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area. This migration trend prevails until the end of the experiment (see mobilized d\u00e9collement contour maps in Fig. 7, Stages 2\u20134). Along the thicker d\u00e9collement-cover area, further shortening (Stage 3, Fig. 7) is still accommodated by the frontal structure, that consists of two thrusts nucleated at the d\u00e9collement pinch-out (CT scan section y3, Fig. 7, Stage 3). In the opposite side of the model, folds amplify, and new structures form (labelled 8 and 9, top view and CT scan section x3, Fig. 7, Stage 3). These newly formed structures are more closely spaced (about 6\u00a0mm) than the previous ones. Some of the structures extend along strike from the edge to the center of the model and the curvature of surficial traces amplified, displaying counterclockwise vertical axis rotations up to 23\u00b0 (top view, Fig. 7, Stage 3). Broadly, the inflexion line where structural trends oriented perpendicular to shortening switch to oblique trends is located in the middle of the models, where the SC\/D ratio is ca. 6\/2. Counterclockwise vertical axis rotations also vary across-strike: distal structures, especially the frontal thrust, display larger values of vertical axis rotation than proximal structures, such as the hinterland-most anticline which is nearly parallel to the backstop. From 65 to 82\u00a0mm of shortening (45%) (Stage 4, Fig. 7), in the thicker d\u00e9collement-cover area, the frontal thrust system still advances while gentle folds finally form behind it as out-of-sequence folding (label 11, top view and CT scan section y4, Fig. 7, Stage 4). In the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area, a frontal thrust finally forms, folds amplify, becoming isoclinal and are eventually truncated by break-thrusts (CT scan section x4, Fig. 7, Stage 4). Increasing shortening results in the along-strike growth of structures, the increase of the top view curvature, where structures in the thinner d\u00e9collement-cover area attain counterclockwise vertical axis rotations of 36\u00b0.\n\n\n3.4\nSummary\nThe characteristics described separately in models with forelandward thinning (Series 3.1) and along-strike (Series 3.2) d\u00e9collement-cover thickness variations converge in the 3D-tapered models (i.e. including both forelandward and lateral thinning; Series 3.3). Some of these features, such as the changes in the number of structures and the differential displacement along strike for each one is enhanced, thus promoting structures with a higher curvature in plan-view and stronger vertical-axis rotations (36\u00b0 in Model 3.3.3, and 27\u00b0 in Model 3.2.3, Figs. 7 and 6 respectively). Vertical axis rotations are not the result of boundary effects (e.g., friction between model and walls because i) the lateral edges of the model are lubricated using CATP\u2122 and ii) there are no vertical axis rotations in the area with thicker layers (Fig. 6a) (where, in addition, more friction might be expected since there is a larger area of contact between model and walls). The 4D analysis of 3D tapered models shows significant differences in their evolution. A break-back sequence is developed in the thicker portion of models due to the early nucleation of the frontal thrust at the d\u00e9collement pinch-out. Meanwhile, the thinner sector is characterized by a combination of a prevailing break-forward sequence and synchronous thrusting and folding (Fig. 7). In general, for all tapered d\u00e9collement-cover wedges, both the wavelength of folds and the displacement of the frontal thrust increase with increasing cover thickness. Folds form without a dominant vergence, with exception of the anticline associated with the major frontal thrust. As shortening progresses, folds become tighter and, some of them develop thrusts in their cores (Fig. 7). D\u00e9collement mobilization is due to two kinds of processes: (i) \u201clong-distance\u201d forelandward and\/or lateral migration depending on the differential cover load and (ii) accumulation in the core of short-wavelength anticlines (\u201cshort-distance\u201d migration from beneath the synclines to the core of the anticlines) in the thinner sectors of the models.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nRheology of the Moon Sand\u2122 and resulting structural styles\nShear stress analyses indicate that Moon Sand\u2122 has a nearly ideal Coulomb behavior showing viscoelastic rheology prior to brittle failure. As previously pointed out by Waffle and coauthors (2016), and further investigated in this work, Moon Sand\u2122 represents an ideal analog material to simulate deformation of the upper crust in centrifuge analog models since it captures the localized failure of rocks at shallow levels and at the same time it is able to reproduce the elastic and viscous phenomena that contribute to deformation prior to failure under progressive deformation (Reber et al., 2020). This mixed behavior may result from the mixture of sand, as a granular and brittle material and the coating polymer, as the viscous phase, as it occurs with other mixed material (e.g., Carbopol gels, Piau, 2007; Shafiei et al., 2018; paraffin oil-soaked sand, Corti, 2004). The possible drawbacks of using this material are (i) its mixed brittle-viscous behavior that allows for relatively strong LPS to occur before actual compressional structures develop and (ii) the lower contrast of properties with the lower, ductile level. The first issue apparently makes more difficult to compare our centrifuge models with models in which the upper crust shows a brittle behavior, according to Byerlee's law. The second potential issue ensues stronger differences between our models and \u201cclassical\u201d sandbox analog models, in which there is an extremely sharp contrast between the brittle and ductile levels (e.g., Davy and Cobbold, 1991; Costa and Vendeville, 2002). However, the properties of the Moon Sand\u2122 do not necessarily represent conditions farther from natural cases. In fact, ductile-equivalent deformational conditions (e.g., volume loss through pressure solution and\/or porosity reduction) are found in the upper crust. This issue is particularly interesting because LPS is actually being recognized as a significant process (often neglected) in fold-and-thrust belts (see, e.g., Sans et al., 2003; Weil and Yonkee, 2012). In many cases, only indirect techniques, such as the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility can give an account (always difficult to quantify) of the LPS (see, e.g., Gracia-Puzo et al., 2021 and references therein). This can be a complex process during which LPS in its turn interferes with the process of volume reduction due to compaction under sediment load conditions. The lithological conditioning can be also very strong (i.e., early lithification in limestones) in whose case LPS is achieved by means of brittle deformation (Branellec et al., 2015). The lithological factor also relates to the gradual vs. sharp rheological change in centrifuge and sandbox models, respectively. In this sense, each type simulates different mechanical stratigraphies (e.g., shale-dominated basins vs. limestone-dominated basins) that can be applied to different scenarios in terms of pre-orogenic basin formation and evolution.\nOn the other hand, this new material allows for working under enhanced gravity conditions and this opens up the possibility of studying the migration of the d\u00e9collement ductile materials within the frame of the kinematic evolution of thrust wedges, a process that is very difficult to observe in conventional sandbox models, partly because of the lower deformation rates and partly because of the high rheological contrast in sand\/silicone systems. The viscous-brittle combined behavior of Moon Sand\u2122 led to a distinctive structural style characterized by the occurrence of a broad range of fold geometries, such as long-wavelength and gentle to isoclinal folds with subvertical fold axes (Fig. 8\na and b), and box-folds (Fig. 8c). Besides, this behavior allows the simulation of active, buckle folding (Yakymchuk et al., 2012), what adds a new perspective and possibilities to the already existing, rich and fruitful catalog of brittle structures such as fault-related folds formed in sandbox analog models (e.g., Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Bonini, 2007). In this sense, our centrifuge models can be considered as a complement to the existing sandbox models simulating similar pre-compressional scenarios. Interestingly, the response of our models to lateral shortening can be also considered under the theory of folding in viscous behavior: the wavelength and number of structures obtained fit predictions from Biot-Ramberg's theory (see Ramsay, 1967 and references therein). This is related with mechanisms of deformation and opens the possibility of working under different conditions in relation to sandpacks, thus completing the set of factors controlling deformation (see e.g., Storti et al., 2007). In this sense, in our models we obtain different fold geometries that can be compared with the ones obtained in sandbox, for example, fault-related box-folds (e.g., Costa and Vendeville, 2002) over detachment folds, which, on the other hand, are actually a common feature in salt-detached contractional systems (Rowan, 1997; Poblet et al., 1998; Scharer et al., 2004; Scott Wilkerson et al., 2007; Izquierdo-Llavall et al., 2018). In our opinion, both types of models must be compared to obtain a realistic picture of geological structures, here considering the geometric and kinematic points of view.\nIn sandbox analog modeling, detachment folding occurs upon specific conditions such as low cover-d\u00e9collement thickness ratios (e.g., Bonini, 2003; Duerto and McClay, 2009) or a certain amount of syn-contractional sedimentation that sustains fold amplification (Bonini, 2003; Pichot and Nalpas, 2009; Pla et al., 2019). Similarly, by using Moon Sand\u2122, buckle and detachment folds occur where low cover-d\u00e9collement thickness ratios exist (Fig. 8d). Nevertheless, conversely to sandbox analog models, fold amplification does not require syn-contractional sedimentation because folding conditions are more easily fulfilled (Fig. 8e). Apart from folding, thrusting mainly occurs along the frontal structures, where (i) single large transport thrusts (Fig. 8f) or (ii) thrust imbricates (Fig. 8g) nucleate at the model salt pinch-out, which represents a notable velocity discontinuity within the model. Minor thrusts and backthrusts also appear at the limb of certain box-folds (Fig. 8c) or as break-thrust (Fig. 8e).\n\n\n4.2\nCentrifuge analog models; basic wedge dynamics, comparison with experiments under natural gravity conditions\nIn this section, our results are compared with previous frictional and non-frictional thrust wedge experiments involving brittle and ductile-brittle stratigraphy and run under natural and enhanced gravity conditions. Centrifuge analog modeling programs involving multilayered sequences based on combining different material such as silicone polymers, plasticines and\/or modeling clays (Dixon and Summers, 1985; Liu and Dixon, 1990; Dixon and Tirrul, 1991; Godin et al., 2011; Noble and Dixon, 2011; Yakymchuk et al., 2012; Faisal and Dixon, 2015; Waffle et al., 2016) are out of the scope of this discussion.\nUnder natural gravity conditions, sandbox analog thrust wedges grow and widen by maintaining a critical taper, and topography is controlled by the angle of internal friction, the cohesion of the cover rocks (almost negligible in sandpacks) and the coefficient of basal friction. This provides powerful insights into the geometry and dynamics of thrust systems and accretionary wedges (e.g., Chapple, 1978; Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen et al., 1984). In this work, experiments presented in Series 1 reached maximum surface slope angle of 10\u00b0. This value is in good agreement with those predicted by the critical taper theory (e.g., Davis et al., 1983; Gao et al., 2018) In sandbox analog models, critical taper angles may vary between 1.5\u00b0 and 18.5\u00b0 for low (0.37) and high (0.55) basal friction conditions, respectively (e.g., Liu et al., 1992), whereas in centrifuge analog models, they attain ca. 14\u00b0 or ca. 20\u00b0 in frictional, damp sand (Mulugeta, 1988) or K-Feldspar sand (Milazzo et al., 2021) thrust wedges, respectively. Thrusting in relatively narrow and limited zones dominates in frictional sandbox thrust wedges (e.g., Liu et al., 1992; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Storti et al., 2000; Agarwal and Agrawal, 2002; Soto et al., 2003; Granado et al., 2017, among many others) and in centrifuge analog models involving K-Feldspar sands (Milazzo et al., 2021). Conversely, in our centrifuge analog models underlain by a frictional detachment, deformation is mostly accommodated by thickening of thrust sheets. Such thickening is likely related to the combined viscous-brittle rheology of Moon Sand\u2122.\nThe occurrence of basal low-strength d\u00e9collements, such as salt in nature or silicone polymers in analog modelling, leads to very low taper angles (e.g., Davis and Engelder, 1987; Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Costa and Vendeville, 2002). This is also observed in our experiments of Series 2 and 3 (i.e., d\u00e9collement-detached thrust wedges), where surface slope angles range between 0\u00b0 and 2\u00b0. The following common features observed in sandbox models developed under normal gravity conditions and above ductile d\u00e9collements (e.g., Davis and Engelder, 1987; Letouzey et al., 1995; Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Costa and Vendeville, 2002; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Luj\u00e1n et al., 2003, 2006) coincide with those observed in our centrifuge models (i.e. Series 2 and 3; Figs. 4\u20137): (1) rapid localization of the outer deformation front along the distal pinch-out of the basal d\u00e9collement, (2) lack of a dominant vergence in contractional structures, (3) thrust nucleation that does not follow a simple sequence and synchronous thrusting in different parts of the model, and (4) thickening of ductile d\u00e9collement material in the cores of the anticlines. Our results portray how the thickness of the d\u00e9collement plus that of the cover sequence are a first order controlling factor of the structural spacing and the number of structures that accommodate shortening: thinner sequences promote the formation of a higher number of structures which are narrowly spaced and show shorter wavelengths than thicker sequences. This observation is true whether different thicknesses are tested separately (series 2, Fig. 4) or progressive variations of thicknesses occur in a single experiment (series 3, Figs. 6 and 7). These features agree with previously published works for frictional and frictional-viscous sandbox analog wedges (Huiqi et al., 1992; Marshak and Wilkerson, 1992; Smit et al., 2003; Storti et al., 2007; Santolaria et al., 2015; Borderie et al., 2019).\nBed-length analysis permits to estimate the amount of LPS in our models, by comparing the initial and final length of a given stratigraphic horizon. In the sand layers of models run under normal gravity conditions (Mulugeta and Koyi, 1987; Koyi, 1995; Koyi and Vendeville, 2003), LPS is accommodated by volume loss through porosity reduction. In frictional sandbox models, LPS has been estimated to accommodate between 17% and 41% of the total shortening (Koyi and Vendeville, 2003). However, in the presence of a viscous basal d\u00e9collement, LPS is significantly reduced (Koyi and Vendeville, 2003). In centrifuge analog models using plasticine and silicone putty as analog materials, Liu and Dixon (1990) already observed that LPS accounts for half of the total of shortening. In our centrifuge experiments performed with Moon Sand\u2122, we have observed that LPS can accommodate higher amounts of deformation: over 90% of the shortening is accommodated by LPS in frictional Models 1.1 and 1.2, in which very few structures actually formed. LPS decreases in models of series 2 and 3.2, where a positive correlation between the cover-d\u00e9collement ratio and shortening accommodated by LPS is found. Thicker covers (Model 2.3, Fig. 4a) attain up to 58% of LPS while thinner covers (Model 2.1, Fig. 4c) do not register significant figures (<1%). This is likely related to the increase of strength with depth (i.e., with cover thickness). Upon contraction, in those models considering a pre-contractional, forelandward-thinning sedimentary wedge (series 3.1), most of the shortening is accommodated by frontal thrusting and LPS reaches ca. 20%. This value increases in those models involving along strike tapered pre-contractional sequences where LPS in differentially distributed: it changes from ca. 19% to ca. 24% between the thinner and thicker parts of the cover, respectively. CT Scans of Model 3.3.3 (Fig. 7) permit to quantify LPS stage-by-stage. The graph in Fig. 9\n illustrates the cumulative LPS (normalized with respect to the total shortening of the experiment; solid lines) and the differential LPS at each stage (normalized with respect to the shortening applied at each stage; dashed lines). Until 42\u00a0mm of shortening, cumulative LPS is evenly distributed along the experimental packages and differential LPS values attained approximately between 88% and 79% either in the thicker and thinner d\u00e9collement-cover areas (Fig. 9). After 42\u00a0mm, there is a decrease of the differential LPS from ca. 85% and 88%\u201357% and 42% in the thicker and thinner d\u00e9collement-cover areas, respectively. From that point onwards, areas with thicker stratigraphy kept on accumulating slightly larger amounts of LPS than areas with thinner sequences. In the thinner sequence area, differential LPS drops to 5% (Fig. 9) coinciding with initiation of the frontal thrust, since most of the shortening is accommodated by forward translation of the cover.\n\n\n4.3\nInfluence of pre-deformational lateral taper in fold and thrust belts\nThe occurrence of a gentle pre-deformational lateral taper appears as a fundamental parameter controlling the architecture of d\u00e9collement-bearing thrust wedges. In models of series 3.1, the forelandward thinning led to a rapid transfer of deformation to the distal d\u00e9collement pinch-out and most of the shortening is accommodated by a large-transport thrust in the frontal thrust wedge. Then, evolution of the thrust wedge is limited to the frontal translation of an undeformed cover pack. It is not until close to the end of experiments when the cover pack registers some deformation behind the wedge front. Using sandbox analog models, Smit and coauthors (2003) tested pre-shortening configurations geometrically similar to our models of Series 3.1: a forelandwards thinning tapered d\u00e9collement-cover with and initial angle of 3\u00b0. As in our models, at the onset of shortening, deformation localized in the distal d\u00e9collement pinch-out. But, with further shortening (and opposite to what we observed in centrifuge models) deformation progressively shift backwards and shortening is mostly accommodated by folds and thrusts within the cover instead of its frontal translation as we observed. A lateral and\/or oblique cover thinning and\/or d\u00e9collement-cover thinning determines the number and displacement of thrusts and hence the occurrence of oblique and curved geometries in plan-view, similarly to results obtained in sandbox models without a ductile d\u00e9collement (Soto et al., 2002, 2003). The lateral taper angle also controls the amount of vertical-axis rotation in the cover and the lateral and forward migration of the ductile d\u00e9collement. Previous sandbox analog modeling experimental programs (e.g., Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Schreurs et al., 2001; Luj\u00e1n et al., 2003; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Vidal-Royo et al., 2009) tested the influence of a discontinuous or geometrically variable ductile d\u00e9collement overlain by a constant thickness sandpack. In general, these studies reported vertical axis rotation on the cover associated with lateral d\u00e9collement pinch-outs trending parallel to the shortening direction. Besides, alike in Series 3.2 models, Storti et al. (2007) modeled sand-silicone packs with a lateral sedimentary taper, obtaining qualitatively similar results, except for the occurrence of a first curved feature associated with important vertical-axis rotation and a strike-slip fault system controlled by the lateral d\u00e9collement pinch-out located at the thinner sector of models. This particular geometrical constraint (lateral d\u00e9collement pinch-out) is not present in our models and therefore results can be analyzed in terms of a laterally continuous d\u00e9collement. Therefore, this allows us to conclude that vertical axis rotations are not necessarily related to a lateral velocity discontinuity but just the thinning of the d\u00e9collement and\/or the overlying sedimentary cover.\nIf we consider our 3D tapered models (Models 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3) in combination with their mirror image (i.e., a pre-orogenic configuration showing a steer's head geometry in the along-strike section, Fig. 9), they would depict a salient characterized by (i) opposite vertical axis rotation of structures at both sides, and (ii) outward migration and backwards accumulation of the d\u00e9collement (Fig. 10\n). Salient (Miser, 1932) is used as a descriptive geometrical term that refers to an arcuate (convex toward the foreland) feature of an orogenic system and it has not any kinematic implication as for example, orocline (Carey, 1955), that corresponds to an orogenic system that has been flexed. Salients occur in many fold-and-thrust belts (Macedo and Marshak, 1999) and their origin may be controlled (Weil and Sussman, 2004 and references therein) by: i) pre-deformational thickness variations and the presence of basal d\u00e9collements (Beutner, 1977; Allmendinger et al., 1990; Lawton et al., 1994; Boyer, 1995; Mitra, 1997; Sempere, 1995), ii) the geometry of the underlying basement or hinterland indentor (Marshak, 2004), iii) buttress effects, iv) wrench-faulting and v) significant changes of the regional stress-field (Weil et al., 2000, 2001). Among all these factors, the presence of salt detachments has been interpreted to play a role on the development of salients in the Jura Mountains (Westerns Alps, Becker, 2000; Hindle et al., 2000; Hindle and Burkhard, 1999), the Monterrey salient (northeastern Mexico, Scott Wilkerson et al., 2007), and the Zagros (SW Iran, Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003; Callot et al., 2012; Snidero et al., 2020), among others. In the following section, we explore the importance of the pre-contractional architecture during mountain building in the well-known example of the South-Central Pyrenees and make comparisons with our experimental results.\n\n\n4.4\nValidation with nature; the South-Central Pyrenees\nThe South-Central Pyrenees display a south-verging arched shape in map view. In its central part, structures trend parallel to the tectonic grain of the range (\u223cN120E) while, when approaching its eastern and western boundaries, lateral structures strike highly oblique to the Pyrenean trend, thus defining a fold-and-thrust belt salient (Sussman et al., 2004; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013, 2018, Fig. 11\n). The South-Central Pyrenees consist of three main thrust sheets which were emplaced from Cretaceous to Oligocene times, mainly following a piggyback thrust sequence. These thrust sheets are, from North to South (older to younger): the Cotiella-B\u00f3ixols, the Pe\u00f1a Monta\u00f1esa-Montsec and the Gavarnie-Sierras Exteriores thrust sheets (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013 and references therein). The thrusts root in Triassic evaporites that (i) represent the regional d\u00e9collement and (ii) extensively crop out as salt accumulations and diapirs in the northern boundary of this salient and along the southernmost thrust sheet where these bodies are related to an inflated Triassic salt horizon (Santolaria et al., 2014, 2016a).\nThe pre-contractional stratigraphic succession in the South-Central Pyrenees (Mesozoic in age) depicts a significant southward thinning, from more than 5000\u00a0m in the Cotiella-B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet to less than 300\u00a0m in the South-Pyrenean front, i.e., the southern edge of the Gavarnie Sierras-Exteriores thrust sheet (Fig. 11). A less abrupt, along-strike thinning also occurs from the East to the West (Soto et al., 2002). In its turn, the Triassic d\u00e9collement thins dramatically or disappears towards the lateral edges of the orogenic salient (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013). It is in these edges where oblique structures occur. To the East, the structures related to the eastern edge of the salient strike N030E whereas, to the West, in the Ainsa Oblique Zone (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013), a series of N\u2013S trending anticlines crop out, forming part of the Gavarnie-Sierras Exteriores thrust sheet. This oblique trend is not primary. Paleomagnetism reveals that these structures were emplaced with a subtle obliquity (Mochales et al., 2012; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013) and then they underwent slight counter-clockwise vertical axis rotations in the eastern boundary (Dinar\u00e9s-Turell, 1992) and high (up to 80\u00b0) clockwise vertical axis rotations in the Ainsa Oblique Zone (Fig. 10) during Eocene-Oligocene times (Bentham, 1992; Sussman et al., 2004; Mochales et al., 2012; Beamud Amor\u00f3s, 2013; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013). According to paleomagnetic data and seismic, well and structural interpretations, the South-Central Pyrenean salient is a progressively formed arc with divergent thrust transport directions formed due to differential displacement gradients (Sussman et al., 2004; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013, 2018).\nAll in all, the pre-contractional features in the South-Central Pyrenees are comparable to the models of series 3.3: basin-related initial geometries including along- and across-strike thickness variations of the d\u00e9collement and the overlying sedimentary sequence. Both in South-Central Pyrenees and in our models, this configuration promotes i) the co-existence of structures parallel and oblique to the main trend, ii) an increase in the number of structures and a shorter structural spacing and wavelength towards the edges of the orogenic salient, where the sedimentary cover is thinner, and iii) the characteristic, overall salient geometry. Besides, the curvature of the South-Central Pyrenean salient has been proved to be secondary, which goes hand by hand with the progressive vertical axis rotation of the oblique structures in its lateral edges. Similarly, in Model 3.3.3 (Fig. 7), between Stages 2 and 4 the linear frontal thrust system progressively acquires a curved shape, at the same time that vertical axis rotation of the innermost structures increases. Furthermore, accumulation of salt and formation of diapirs along the edges of this orogenic salient has been proposed to be partially caused by the outward, centrifugal migration of the Triassic evaporites (Santolaria et al., 2016a), from beneath pre- and syn-contractional depocenters to the areas where the sedimentary cover is thinner. Results obtained by compressing a tapered cover over a d\u00e9collement level, as in series 3.3, support this hypothesis since such an outward migration is also observed in the silicone basal plate (see contour maps of the mobilized d\u00e9collement in Stages 3 and 4 in Fig. 7).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nOur experimental centrifuge analog modelling program showed that Moon Sand\u2122, and CATP\u2122 (Crazy Aaron's Thinking Putty\u2122) silicone putty, are ideal analog materials for centrifuge modeling to simulate deformation occurring in frictional thrust wedges and salt-detached fold-and-thrust belts. Shear tests indicate that Moon Sand\u2122 behaves as a visco-elastic material prior to brittle failure which makes it a good analog of sedimentary rocks in the brittle upper crust. This combined behavior is likely related to its composition: regular, fine-grained quartz sand coated with polymer and synthetic rubber binders. Upon shortening and when detached along CATP\u2122 silicone putty, deformation results in layer parallel shortening, folding, and thrusting. Detachment folds with box-fold geometry and associated break-out thrusts, and thrusts showing significant displacements dominate the structural style in the presented models.\nA series of simple, layer-cake, models successfully tested the use of Moon Sand\u2122 in modeling a frictional scenario (Series 1), where the models grew by incorporating new material to the frontal thrust wedge attaining taper angles of 10\u00b0, values that are in good agreement with those predicted by the critical taper theory. Taper angles drop to 0-2\u00b0 in d\u00e9collement-detached models (Series 2), as also found in sandbox models and nature. 3D tapered models that demonstrate the influence of lateral thickness variations of the d\u00e9collement-cover pre-contractional sequence showed: i) deformation partitioning triggered differential frontal translation and vertical axis rotation of the cover where it is thinner and ii) along- and across-strike migration of the d\u00e9collement.\nThe similarities mentioned above justify the comparison between the results obtained from experiments performed under natural gravity conditions and our centrifuge analog models. Both types of models indicate that the pre-orogenic wedging of the sedimentary sequence favors the along-strike change of structural trends, vertical axis rotations and d\u00e9collement migration. Thrust salients and especially progressive arcs in orogenic belts can be understood as a response to progressive changes in thickness of the d\u00e9collement levels and the sedimentary cover without the need of other factors as abrupt d\u00e9collement pinch-outs, along-strike changes in shortening rate or basement geometries. This highlights the strong control imposed by facies distribution and, consequently, paleogeography, on the development and geometry of subsequent structures. This is the case of the South Central Pyrenean salient.\nUsing conventional centrifuge analog materials together with Moon Sand\u2122 to simulate the semi-brittle cover is shown to be a promising new approach to investigate controlling factors in fold-and-thrust belts.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nP.

They have subsequently been documented in over 150 basins around the world, where they typically span areas of 105\u2013107\u00a0km2 and occur in stratigraphically restricted intervals (tiers) composed dominantly of fine-grained sediments (Fig. 1\n) (Cartwright, 2011 and references therein).\nThe widespread occurrence of PFSs within the shallow subsurface of many slope or basin floor settings suggests they initiate and begin to propagate early in the burial history of the host tier (Cartwright, 1994a,b; Berndt et al., 2003; Stuevold et al., 2003), perhaps within tens of metres of the sea floor (Morgan et al., 2015). Numerous studies have suggested that polygonal faults propagate upwards through the near surface sediments with continued burial and sedimentation (Lonergan et al., 1998a; Goulty, 2001a; Stuevold et al., 2003; Gay and Berndt, 2007; Davies and Ireland, 2011; Tewksbury et al., 2014). The important question of whether or not polygonal faults can be regarded as syn-sedimentary faults in which the upper fault tip breaches the contemporaneous depositional surface is still open, although several authors have used growth indices or fault network characteristics to argue that this is generally the case (Lonergan et al., 1998a; Stuevold et al., 2003; Morgan et al., 2015). Most recently, King and Cartwright (2020) identified small bathymetric scarps on the present sea floor offshore Norway to argue that these were the surface expression of syn-sedimentary polygonal faults, confirming similar observations made in the Rockall Trough by Berndt et al. (2012).\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the nucleation and growth of PFSs, but most have been discounted as universal mechanisms because they cannot explain the formation or growth of all polygonal fault systems observed globally (Cartwright et al., 2003; Goulty, 2008; Cartwright, 2011). In recent years, \u2018gravitational loading\u2019 (Goulty, 2001a; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005) and \u2018diagenetically-induced shear failure\u2019 (Shin et al., 2008, 2010; Cartwright, 2011) have been favoured as mechanisms to explain the later propagation and early initiation of polygonal faults, respectively.\nThe gravitational loading mechanism is the main focus of our modelling study presented in this paper. It provides an elegant geomechanical explanation of the upward propagation of already well developed fault zones with increasing sediment loads of progressive burial (Goulty, 2001a,b; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005; Goulty, 2008). The residual failure criterion of a pre-existing fault is exceeded under laterally confined loading conditions (Fig. 2\n A) if it is hosted within a material with a sufficiently low residual friction angle and a high K0 value. K0 is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure \u2018at rest\u2019, calculated as the ratio of the horizontal effective stress over the vertical effective stress, which is typically \u223c0.3\u20130.4 for coarse-grained sediments and >0.7 for fine-grained sediments (Jones, 1994; Goulty, 2001a; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005; Casey, 2014). However, the gravitational loading mechanism does not explain either the nucleation of polygonal faults or how displacement is accommodated.\nIn contrast, it has been suggested that the diagenetically-induced shear failure mechanism may explain the full evolution of a PFS, from genesis to fossilisation (Shin et al., 2008, 2010; Cartwright, 2011). In this model, a diagenetically-induced change in the grain volume or contact stresses between grains results in a decrease in the minimum principal stress, which can cause the localisation and continued propagation of a shear fracture. Furthermore, the volumetric reduction associated with such a diagenetic mechanism can help accommodate the local strains required by displacement gradients on the fault surface in laterally-pinned conditions (Shin et al., 2008).\nAttempts at resolving the relative merits of competing models using numerical modelling have been limited to date. Shin et al. (2010) used a Drucker-Prager model to investigate the physical properties that are required to accommodate the strain and deformation that arise from the growth of a laterally-pinned fault. Shin et al. (2010) found that the throw-to-height scaling relationships of polygonal faults were only achieved at exceptionally low material bulk stiffness values and attributed this finding to diagenetic grain dissolution, following results from earlier physical modelling work (Shin et al., 2008). However, the bulk material stiffness term used in the Shin et al. (2010) Drucker-Prager models does not explicitly incorporate gravity-driven mechanical compaction of granular sediment. Roberts et al. (2014) and Roberts (2014) used the ELFEN geomechanical code and a SoftRock 3 constitutive model to demonstrate that a diagenetically-triggered isotropic chemical porosity reduction, such as that caused by the transition of opal-A to opal-CT, of 5% was sufficient to localise and propagate shear fractures that resembled the geometries and network intersections of polygonal faults in two-dimensional cross-section and three-dimensional planforms. Roberts et al. (2014) and Roberts (2014) also showed that a horizontal stress anisotropy of just 3% was enough to align over 80% of fault orientations to within \u00b110\u00b0 of the maximum horizontal stress. Despite the advances made by these pioneering studies, our understanding of the relative magnitudes of different drivers of PFS growth is limited, and the role of gravity-driven mechanical compaction may have been overlooked as a means of accommodating polygonal fault displacement.\nIn this study, we used the gravitational loading model proposed by Goulty (2001) as a basis to numerically model the hypothesis that gravity-driven differential compaction drives the accumulation of throw on pre-existing polygonal faults that are hosted in laterally-pinned (i.e. the lateral boundaries of the model are fixed) unconsolidated sediments, under realistic physical property conditions. To test the model, we developed a series of laterally-pinned finite element models using the ELFEN geomechanical code, to examine the evolution of a single fault that propagates synchronously with the deposition of granular compacting sediment. We investigated the sensitivity of the accrual of fault displacement with respect to three main variables: (1) material compaction profiles, (2) residual friction angles, and (3) fault dip angles, in order to evaluate under what conditions the continued propagation of a normal fault might be driven by gravitational loading alone. Although aimed at the study of polygonal fault systematics, this type of modelling approach is applicable to other types of normal faults hosted in relatively unlithified and compactable sediments, so the results have wider implications than simply for PFSs.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\n\n2.1\nComputational framework\nTo undertake our analysis, we used the ELFEN forward modelling geomechanical code, which is a finite strain, quasi-static, explicit finite element continuum formulation. The underlying computational methods are discussed extensively by Per\u00edc and Crook (2004). This modelling framework has been used to solve a host of geological problems ranging from salt tectonics (Nikolinakou et al., 2014a,b) to regional fold and thrust belts (Albertz and Lingrey, 2012), as well as previous studies of polygonal fault systems (Roberts et al., 2014; Roberts, 2014). However, alternative modelling approaches such as the Discrete Element Method (DEM), which unlike the finite element continuum approach does not use a pre-defined material constitutive model but instead models the interaction of rock particle assemblages governed by Newton's laws of motion, have been used to solve similar geological problems (Finch et al., 2003; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2009; Gray et al., 2014). We selected a finite element approach because the DEM approach can require excessively long solution times due to the searches needed to evaluate the particle interactions, which can therefore limit the model resolution (Yinet al., 2009), and the calibration of some DEM models can present challenges in obtaining values recorded from physical experiments (Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2009). The ability to pre-define the material behaviour in a continuum approach offered greater specificity when designing a sensitivity analysis of granular material compaction trends, and previous studies of PFSs using these modelling tools provided a proof of concept prior to embarking on our study. However, both the finite element and discrete element methods offer valid approaches to the study of polygonal fault systems.\n\n\n2.2\nConstitutive model\nThe constitutive model relates deformational strains and stresses through a set of equations (see Supplementary Material for detailed descriptions) that comprise material-specific parameters, such as frictional and dilational angles. We used the SoftRock 3 (SR3) constitutive model, which is an advanced variant of the Modified Cam Clay model (Crook et al., 2006) that is derived from Critical State Soil Mechanics theory (Schofield and Wroth, 1968; Muir Wood, 1990), in our study because it explicitly incorporates the role of granular sediment compaction in material deformation. Alternative constitutive frameworks, such as the Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager models have been used in several computational geological studies (Schultz-Ela, 2003; Gradmann et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2010), however, they do not explicitly account for granular compaction and are therefore, better suited to the characterisation of lithified and crystalline rocks. Several previous studies have used an SR3 constitutive framework to model the elastoplastic deformation associated with salt diapirs rising through porous sediments (Nikolinakou et al., 2014a,b), and the investigation of polygonal faulting in unconsolidated fine-grained sediments (Roberts et al., 2014; Roberts, 2014).\nThe methodology and calibration of the SoftRock 3 constitutive framework are discussed extensively by Crook et al. (2006), Rockfield (2010), and Roberts et al. (2014). This approach offers a fully regularised treatment of softening and identification of emerging localisations, extending the seminal work of Rudnicki and Rice (1975). The full elastoplastic formulation is included in the Supplementary Material, however, we use a reduced subset of its full capability in our analysis. Specifically, rather than determining the nucleation and propagation of the fault plane via the intersection of the material stress path with the state boundary surface as in the diagenetically-induced fault nucleation simulations undertaken by Roberts et al. (2014), we instead prescribe the fault with a frictional planar surface. In addition, the SoftRock 3 constitutive framework includes a porous elastic law that is included in our simulations, but its influence is negligible over the burial depths of our material models which are instead primarily deforming via compaction-related plastic strain determined by the hardening law (see Supplementary Material).\n\n\n2.3\nModel setup\n\n2.3.1\nModelling strategy\nOur modelling strategy was designed to test the gravitational loading model for polygonal fault growth. Our primary goal was to investigate the extent to which stress perturbations related to low friction coefficients on a fully developed fault surface would result in differential compaction of hanging wall versus footwall (Fig. 3\n). We constructed a suite of two-dimensional field-scale finite element models that simulate the upward propagation of a pre-existing normal fault from a fixed lower tip with synchronous sedimentation in laterally-pinned plane-strain conditions. We assumed that the pore fluid pressure was hydrostatic throughout the evolution of the model simulations, based on the recognition that polygonal fault systems are commonly hosted in hemipelagic depositional systems with low sedimentation rates in which significant disequilibrium compaction overpressure is unlikely to develop (Cartwright and Dewhurst, 1998 and references therein).\nThe numerical modelling programme was designed to allow a sensitivity analysis of the accrual of fault throw with respect to three key variable parameters. Firstly, the bulk lithology of the sequence hosting a polygonal fault and its typical compactional response to burial. Since polygonal fault systems are hosted in a range of dominantly fine-grained lithologies, it was regarded as important to capture the compactional response of this broad range of materials. Secondly, the friction angle of the fault plane (residual friction angle), because as argued by Goulty (2002), this should be a critical parameter governing conditions allowing continued slip on the fault. Finally, the dip angle at which the fault plane propagates since this partly controls the shear stress resolved on the fault plane.\nThe models comprise a thin initially deposited basal unit that hosts a pre-existing fault plane which then propagates upwards from a fixed lower tip within that basal unit as additional layers are added above (Fig. 3). The upward fault propagation occurs synchronously with the deposition of 1000\u00a0m of unconsolidated granular material at a sedimentation rate of 100\u00a0m\/m.y. over fifty 0.2 million-year time increments, simulating 10 million-years. Downward propagation of the basal tip is inhibited by detachment at the lower boundary of the model (see next section).\nMaterial compaction is fully coupled throughout all fifty depositional stages, where we assume fully-drained conditions with no build-up of overpressure. The material compaction profile, the initial fault plane dip and residual friction angle are prescribed for each model simulation, and their respective influences on fault throw are investigated via sensitivity analysis. The material compaction profile with increasing burial depth is prescribed in each simulation, where we investigate four primary compaction curves (outlined in \n\nSection 3.3.3\n\n). The fault plane friction angle (residual friction angle) remains constant in each simulation, and is investigated over values of 5\u00b0, 7\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 11\u00b0. The fault dip angle is prescribed on the upper tip segment that propagates at each 0.2 million-year time increment, however, the fault dip angle shallows dynamically with burial as a result of compaction creating a degree of fault dip listricity. We investigate initial dip angle values of 40\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 80\u00b0, which when compacted shallow by as much as 15\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 at depth. These values were selected from the range of natural dip measurements of polygonal faults (Neagu et al., 2010).\n\n\n2.3.2\nBoundary conditions\nThe width of the models are set so that there is no interaction between fault-related deformations in the central portion of the model and the lateral boundary conditions, and vice versa. All models are 2000\u00a0m wide with element sizes of \u223c5\u00a0m, except for the investigation of a 40\u00b0 dipping fault plane which requires a 3000\u00a0m wide model to prevent edge effects. All of the models have frictionless boundary conditions at both their lateral edges and base, where elements at the model boundaries are confined but are able to slide freely. The basal slip condition was selected to represent natural examples where a basal detachment has been interpreted at the base of regional polygonally faulted tiers (Cartwright, 2011) and may also be considered akin to an overpressured basal mobile layer as suggested by Nicol et al. (2003). We note that a fully-fixed basal boundary condition also produces appreciable displacement.\n\n\n2.3.3\nMaterial characterisation\nWe characterised four materials, m1-m4, to capture a range of different compaction profiles that are exhibited by fine-grained sediments. All materials used in our analysis are characterised with the same underlying elastic physical property and SR3 property parameters (see Supplementary Material, Tables SM1 and SM2), however, each material has a unique compaction profile that is defined by a piecewise linear lambda-kappa parameter in the hardening law (see Supplementary Material) all with an initial porosity value of 70%.\nOver the shallow burial depths analysed in our models, gravitationally-driven volumetric strains of high porosity granular sediments are predominately plastic rather than elastic. We include the SR3 porous elastic laws (see Supplementary Material) in our material characterisation for completeness, however, our models are insensitive to changes in both the stiffness parameter value (E) and Poisson's ratio paramater value (\u03bd) that fall within the range of those recorded from fine-grained sediments (Santamarina et al., 2001). Furthermore, the SR3 property parameters used to define the state boundary surface are included (see Supplementary Material). It should be noted that fault plane propagation is prescribed in our models rather than determined via the intersection of the material stress path with the state boundary surface. The SR3 frictional and dilational parameters were chosen such that the material is characterised with a K0 value of 0.7\u20130.72 typical of fine-grained sediments (Jones, 1994; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005; Casey, 2014).\nThe compaction profiles that define each material (m1-m4) have been guided by consideration of compaction curves from shales and argillaceous sediments, experimental compaction curves derived from kaolinite-smectite aggregates, and porosity-versus-depth data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) wells that logged four different polygonal fault systems (Fig. 4\n). These reference compaction curves were selected to capture the range of natural compaction behaviour in the shallow burial regime typical of the growth of polygonal fault systems (Cartwright et al., 2003). They define the trajectory of a given starting lithology in porosity-depth space, yielding incremental differences in both the gradient of compaction with depth and the absolute amount of compaction. The m1, m2, and m3 materials are defined to capture the upper, middle, and lower ranges of compaction curve profiles recorded from fine-grained sediments in previous compaction studies (compiled in Mondol et al., 2007). The m4 material more closely traces the porosity versus depth profiles of biosiliceous fine-grained sediments recorded from ODP boreholes that transect known polygonal fault systems (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1987,1990, 1996, 2001). After the first 150\u00a0m of burial the compaction gradients of the m1 and m4 materials are approximately equal, which presents an opportunity to compare the influence of the absolute magnitude and the gradient of volumetric reduction on the accrual of fault throw.\nThe material residual friction angle (fault friction angle) is a variable parameter that is investigated through sensitivity analysis over values between 5\u00b0 and 11\u00b0. This range of values was selected based on experimental data from ring shear, drained shear box, and rotary shear tests of claystones and siliceous mudstones (Table 1\n). It is challenging to scale up from experimental measurements of residual shear strength to the effective residual shear strength of a natural fault zone many tens to hundreds of metres tall and perhaps tens of centimetres wide. However, in the absence of any data from natural faults the experimentally derived values were considered to be the best starting point for this modelling study.\n\n\n2.3.4\nModel outputs\nA standard set of outputs was generated for each model simulation, including effective mean stress, effective mean stress perturbation, horizontal effective mean stress perturbation, vertical effective mean stress perturbation, and vector plots of principal stress values. Fault throw was measured as the throw at each stratigraphic marker along the fault plane for each growth increment. Throw was measured rather than displacement to enable ease of comparison to previous polygonal fault studies, in which throw is the standard measure derived from seismic reflection datasets. These measurements were plotted as throw versus height profiles. Maximum throw (Tmax) against fault height ratios were generated for the full suite of model simulations and were benchmarked to the global range of Tmax versus height values compiled by Shin et al. (2010). Throw rates for the final stages of each model simulation were derived by taking the throw value at the stratigraphic marker deposited one million years before the present timestep.\n\n\n2.3.5\nKinematic justification\nThe kinematics of our fault propagation models are based on previous studies that have shown: (1) polygonal faults nucleate in the lower portions of their tiers early in their burial history (Cartwright et al., 2003); (2) polygonal faults propagate in an upwards direction for much of their growth histories (Morgan et al., 2015), where their downward propagation is impeded by a basal mechanical barrier or a detachment into a mobile basal layer (Cartwright et al., 2003; Cartwright, 2011); (3) polygonal fault systems are found at the present day (Gay and Berndt, 2007; Berndt et al., 2012; Armandita et al., 2015; Morgan et al., 2015) and paleo-seabed, as evidenced by small growth packages (Cartwright, 1994a, 2011; Lonergan et al., 1998a; Stuevold et al., 2003; Laurent et al., 2012; King and Cartwright, 2020), which suggests that polygonal faults can propagate upwards at or near the seabed; (4) fault propagation may occur synchronously with gravitational loading in sediments with sufficiently high K0 values and sufficiently low residual friction angles (Goulty, 2001a; Goulty and Swarbrick, 2005) (Fig. 2 A); (5) hemipelagic sedimentation rates in deep marine depositional environments are low (\u223c2\u2013200\u00a0m\/m.y.) (Cartwright and Dewhurst, 1998; Shipboard Scientific Party, 1987, 1990, 1996, 2001).\nGeometrical and quantitative measures to compare our modelling results and test our hypothesis are offered by the maximum throw (Tmax) versus height empirical scaling relationship established by Shin et al. (2010), and a plethora of polygonal fault throw versus height profiles from multiple basins around the world (Neagu et al., 2010; Turrini et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2017). Recently recorded throw rates from surface-breaching polygonal fault upper tips from the V\u00f8ring Basin (King and Cartwright, 2020) were used to compare with growth rates generated in the models.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nIn order to obtain adequate comparisons of model outputs for the three main variable parameters of friction, dip, and material compaction properties (Fig. 5\n), outputs were generated for a total of 18 numerical model simulations. An illustrative example of the temporal evolution of a single fault growth model is shown in Figs. 6 and 7\n\n for the m1-fr5-d60 model (where m1 is the material model, fr5 represents the residual friction angle used was 5\u00b0, and d60 represents the fault propagated with a dip angle of 60\u00b0) at 2 million-year time increments. A principal stress vector plot for this model at the 10 million-year timestep is presented in Fig. 8\n. This shows that there is considerable rotation of the maximum and minimum stresses associated with frictional sliding on the fault plane (Mandl, 1988). The stress field is unperturbed at the lateral edges of the models, where the effective mean stress increases monotonically with depth as the result of one-dimensional consolidation (Terzaghi and Peck, 1948). Effective mean stress perturbations are found on both sides of the fault plane, where they dissipate to ambient values within a few hundred metres of the fault plane (Fig. 6). The results of our full suite of model simulations are illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\n3.1\nMaterial compaction and fault throw\nFaults hosted within each of the m1-m4 materials (Fig. 5 A) yield different maximum throw values with respect to the fault height (Fig. 5 B), implying that the compactional response plays a key role in the accumulation of throw. The greatest maximum throw values accrue on faults hosted in the m1 material (Fig. 5 B), which exhibits the largest degree of compaction with burial depth of the four selected material characterisations (Fig. 5 A). Faults hosted in the m2 and m3 materials accrue lower maximum throw values compared to faults hosted in the m1 material (Fig. 5 B), which reflects the incrementally lower compactional strain accumulated with burial depth (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, faults hosted in the m4 material initially accrue lower maximum throw values than faults hosted in the m2 and m3 materials at heights less than 450\u00a0m and 600\u00a0m, respectively. However, at fault heights greater than 450\u00a0m and 600\u00a0m, respectively, the maximum throw values are larger for faults hosted in the m4 material than their m2 and m3 counterparts (Fig. 5 B). The gradient of the Tmax versus fault height trends (Fig. 5 B) for faults hosted in the m1 and m4 materials are approximately equal, which reflects the similarities in their compaction profile gradients at burial depths deeper than 150\u00a0m (Fig. 5 A). However, faults hosted in the m1 material yield larger maximum throw values than those of faults hosted in our m4 material because of the differences in their compaction profiles in the first 150\u00a0m of burial below the surface.\nThe gradients of the Tmax versus fault height trends (Fig. 5 B) for faults hosted in the m2 and m3 materials decrease with increasing fault height in a curvilinear fashion as the rate of material compaction reduces with greater burial depth. In contrast, the near-constant gradients of the Tmax versus fault height trends of faults hosted in the m1 and m4 materials reflect their respective near-constant compaction profiles with burial depths in excess of 150\u00a0m (Fig. 5 A). Once the sediment hosting the fault ceases to undergo further compaction, as characterised by the m3inh and m4inh materials (Fig. 5 A) at burial depths greater than \u223c350\u00a0m, the Tmax versus fault height gradient decreases dramatically to near-zero with increasing fault height (Fig. 5 B).\nThe influence of inhibited material compaction with burial depth on the accrual of fault throw is seen most clearly in the effective stress contour plots and accompanying throw versus height plots illustrated in Figs. 9\u201311\n\n\n. Here we see that throw continues to accumulate in the upper portions of the faults that are hosted in compacting stratigraphy at burial depths shallower tha\u00f1350\u00a0m, but fault throw ceases to accumulate on deeper portions of the faults that are hosted in stratigraphic intervals which do not undergo compaction (Figs. 9 and 10).\nThe throw versus height plots of the m3inh and m4inh simulations exhibit flat gradients across the central portion of the fault, where throw values are roughly constant \u2013 characteristic of \u2018M-style\u2019 faults \u2013 and the locus of maximum throw migrates up the fault. This pattern contrasts with that seen for the simulations using material m3 and m4 uninhibited which have Tmax values located in the lower to central third of the fault height and \u2018C-shaped\u2019 throw versus height profiles (Fig. 11) (Muraoka and Kamata, 1983). The m3inh and m4inh simulations also exhibit elevated effective mean stress perturbations in the lower portion of the tier compared to their m3 and m4 simulations (Figs. 9 and 10).\n\n\n3.2\nDip angles and fault throw\nTo examine the impact of fault dip on fault growth, we simply selected the material and friction angle most likely to yield the maximum throw values, i.e. the m1 material with a residual friction angle of 5\u00b0. During each model simulation, the effect of increasing burial was to reduce the dip of the initial fault plane as a result of compaction of the entire cross-section. This decrease of dip due to compactional flattening has been observed for polygonal fault dips in a detailed study from offshore Norway (Neagu et al., 2010) (Figs. 5 G & 14) but is likely to occur generally (Stuevold et al., 2003; Cartwright, 2011). It is worth noting that throw is not a good proxy for displacement as the dip decreases with increasing burial depth, and this should be borne in mind when examining the plots.\nFor the four model simulations of varying initial dips of 40, 50, 60 and 70\u00b0, the largest throw values accumulated on faults that propagated with an initial dip of 60\u00b0 (Figs. 14\u201316). Interestingly, smaller throws were measured for faults with greater and lesser initial dips (Fig. 5 D & F and Fig. 15). Faults with dip propagation angles of 40\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 80\u00b0 yield Tmax values of 61%, 87%, 83%, and 31%, respectively, of that obtained for an initial dip of 60\u00b0 (Fig. 5 F). The throw versus height plots reveal (Figs. 15 and 16) that steeply dipping fault planes yield more evenly distributed \u2018C-shaped\u2019 throw versus height profiles and shallower dipping fault planes yield \u2018L-shaped\u2019 throw versus height profiles with greater throw values skewed to the lower portions of the fault (Muraoka and Kamata, 1983; Turrini et al., 2017). At the maximum fault height achieved at the end of the m1 material simulations, the joint-steepest gradients of the Tmax versus fault height trends are found on the faults with propagating dip angles of 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 (Fig. 5 D). When taking account of compaction of the dip angle (Figs. 5 G & 14), the average compacted dips of the 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 cases are \u223c40\u00b0\u201350\u00b0 and \u223c50\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 respectively. This is consistent with the stress decomposition of an overburden load with respect to a fracture plane, where the maximum shear stress occurs at a 45\u00b0 angle to the maximum principal stress (Fossen, 2016).\n\n\n3.3\nResidual friction angles and fault throw\nTo explore the sensitivity of fault growth to variation in the residual friction angle, models were run with a fault plane with a propagation dip of 60\u00b0 hosted in each of the m1-m4 materials over residual friction angles of 5\u00b0, 7\u00b0, 9\u00b0, and 11\u00b0 (Table 1). For fixed values of fault dip and material properties, throw values are always highest on faults with the lowest residual friction angles (Fig. 5 C). Maximum throw values decrease exponentially with increasing residual friction angles, reaching zero when the fault plane friction angle equals the host material peak friction angle (Fig. 5 E).\nAt residual friction angles of 5\u00b0, all four of the material characterisations yield high maximum throw values with respect to the fault height, with values in the upper range of those recorded from polygonal fault systems (Shin et al., 2010). As the residual friction angle increases to 7\u00b0, the maximum throw values with respect to fault height derived from our four material models decrease by \u223c45%, with values in the mid-lower end of those recorded polygonal fault systems (Shin et al., 2010). An increase in the residual friction angle by a further two degrees to 9\u00b0 yields maximum throw with respect to fault height values that are below the lowest values recorded from polygonal fault systems. At residual friction angles of 11\u00b0 throw does not accumulate in measurable quantities across the fault plane. If the model results can legitimately be extrapolated to natural systems, this suggests that polygonal faults do not accumulate displacement at residual friction angles greater than 11\u00b0 under fully drained gravitational loading conditions (Figs. 5 C and 17).\n\n\n3.4\nThrow versus height profiles\nThe throw versus height profiles derived from our models (Figs. 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 and 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n) are comparable to those derived from PFS studies from basins around the world (Morgan et al., 2015; Turrini et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2017). Common to all the simulated throw versus height profiles is the steeper lower tip gradient compared to the upper tip gradient (Table 2\n and Fig. 19). A greater proportion of the throw accrues in the lower third and central third of the tier. Fault throw versus height profiles have curved \u2018C-shaped\u2019 or \u2018L-shaped\u2019 geometries for material models with high degrees of compaction. For the m3inh and m4inh simulations, which incorporate layers that do not compact, the throw versus height profiles have a flatter \u2018M-shaped\u2019 central portion and lower maximum throw with respect to fault height values (Table 2 and Figs. 11 and 19).\nAn example of the temporal evolution of throw with respect to increasing fault height is illustrated in Fig. 6. Here fault throw accumulates proportionately with successive fault propagation and sedimentation throughout the temporal evolution of our models. Throw versus height plots have quasi-symmetric profiles in the earliest phases of growth (\u22642.5 million-years) that become more asymmetric with continued fault growth through time (\u22655 million-years), where greater throw values are skewed towards the lower third of the fault.\n\n\n3.5\nThrow rates\nThrow rates measured for the final million years of each model simulation range between 0 and 10.45\u00a0m\/m.y. The fastest throw rates were recorded on the faults with the greatest Tmax values as a percentage of the fault height (Table 2 and Fig. 20\n). The measured throw rates increase temporally throughout the evolution of the models, reflecting the greater amounts of throw that accumulate at each subsequent timestep because of the larger thickness of differentially compacting sediment in the footwall and hanging wall as the fault height increases (Fig. 20). The throw rates recorded from our model simulations exhibit the same range as those recorded from a PFS in the V\u00f8ring Basin, where similar sedimentation rates are recorded to those used in our models (King and Cartwright, 2020).\n\n\n3.6\nStress field perturbations\nThe effective stress outputs from the models (Figs. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15\u201318) reveal a consistent pattern of effective mean stress perturbations in both the fault footwalls and hanging walls. The lower region of the footwalls closest to the base of each model exhibit reduced effective stress relative to the far field values and hence are \u2018shadowed\u2019 from the full extent of the overburden load. In contrast the basal regions of hanging walls exhibit enhanced effective stress values because frictional sliding on the fault plane facilitates a rotation of the principal stress axes (Fig. 8). Enhanced effective mean stress anomalies dissipate to the background values within a few hundred metres of the fault. The shapes of these anomalous regions of enhanced or reduced effective stress vary from model to model, but in general the magnitude of these stress anomalies corresponds well to the parameter combinations which yield the greatest throw values.\nThe horizontal effective stress perturbations are elevated in a triangular region adjacent to the fault plane and in a basal region at the lower tier boundary in the fault hanging wall. The horizontal effective stress perturbations are reduced (blue colours) in the lowermost footwall and in a dilational triangular zone in the hanging wall that separates the two aforementioned elevated areas, which is associated with the hinge of bed rotation caused by frictional sliding on the fault plane. The vertical effective stress perturbations are elevated in a circular shaped focal region at the base of the fault hanging wall, and are reduced in a \u223c100\u00a0m radius of the fault plane in both the footwall and hanging wall.\nThe effective mean stress (and both the vertical and horizontal components) perturbations are greater in the m3inh and m4inh material models which stop compacting at depths in excess of \u223c350\u00a0m. In the m3inh and m4inh cases, the focal regions of effective stress perturbations migrate upward across the portion of the fault plane hosted within non-compacting strata (Figs. 9 and 10). The lateral boundaries of all simulations exhibit unperturbed one-dimensional consolidation stress fields.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nOur study aimed to evaluate the model suggested by Goulty (2001, 2002) for gravitational loading as a mechanism to explain the growth of polygonal faults. We designed a numerical modelling programme to evaluate the impact of varying the residual friction on the fault and its dip on the stress state adjacent to a single polygonal fault under protracted burial and loading conditions (Fig. 3). We attempted to capture the realistic range of compaction parameters for the typical sediments that are known to host polygonal faults and used these material models as a third variable in a set of sensitivity analyses. Our results allow us to propose some general inferences that may be directly applicable in natural fault systems.\n\n4.1\nStress perturbations and differential compaction\nA key finding of this study is that if a fault is characterised by uniformly distributed, residual friction values of 9\u00b0 or less, then for a wide range of fault dips there is a measurable perturbation in the state of stress around the fault, with stress shadowing in the footwall, and localised stress enhancement in the hanging wall, particularly evident close to the basal tier boundary. These stress perturbations include components of both vertical and horizontal stress increase\/decrease. This implies that simply under purely passive gravitational loading with no lateral strain (the formally defined K0 loading condition, Lambe and Whitman, (1994)) under which polygonal faults are widely believed to form (Cartwright and Lonergan, 1996), there is a significant component of horizontal compaction and hence line length reduction in a bed-parallel direction, as argued by Goulty (2002). Furthermore, the perturbation in the stress field results in a fundamental asymmetry across the fault and that in turn leads to differential volumetric strains across the fault, and it is this differential straining that necessitates semi-continuous slip on the fault surface to accommodate the wall rock strains of different magnitudes.\nIn soft, unlithified, fine grained sediments of the types typically found to host PFSs, it is most probable that the volumetric strain is expressed as porosity loss, but clearly other forms of strain are possible, including fracturing, stylolite formation and compaction bands (Hibsch et al., 2003; Fa\u00ff-Gomord et al., 2017). For simplicity, we therefore consider this type of fault growth as a form of differential compaction faulting, whereby purely vertical gravitational loading is partitioned by the low friction on the fault and leads to a component of slip on such a pre-defined fault.\nDifferential compaction faults can develop in a range of contexts but have previously been linked to lateral changes in compaction properties such as across carbonate reefs or channel sands encased in muddy sediments, or to differential compaction on the flanks of basement highs draped by muddy sediments (Powers, 1922; Carver, 1968; Labute and Gretener, 1969; O'Connor and Gretener, 1974; Gay Jr, 1989; Laubach et al., 1999). The addition here of a mechanism to produce differential compaction faulting clearly has fundamental implications for the growth of polygonal faults, as shown by our modelling, but it extends beyond PFSs to any fault that by virtue of its low residual friction perturbs the stress state related to vertical loading under gravity.\n\n\n4.2\nFault scaling relationships\nOne of the central arguments developed by Shin et al. (2010) in the first attempt to model polygonal fault kinematics was that extremely low bulk stiffnesses of the host medium would be required to achieve the displacement-height ratios recorded from natural systems. In contrast, our results suggest that the empirical scaling relationship between the maximum throw values and heights of polygonal faults (Shin et al., 2010) can be replicated via simple differential compaction across pre-existing faults with uniformly distributed residual friction values less than \u223c9\u00b0 hosted in fine-grained sediments with a range of compaction profiles (Fig. 5). Our results suggest that the accumulation of throw on polygonal faults is most sensitive to changes in the residual friction angle, and hence much of the scatter in global plots of throw versus fault height (Shin et al., 2010) may be due to variations in friction angle within a fault population. One caveat should be applied here: our model assumes an initial stage of fault nucleation and growth before gravitational loading dominates the strain accumulation, and some of the throw on any given fault should therefore be rightly ascribed to the initial stages of nucleation and propagation.\n\n\n4.3\nIncremental addition of displacement during fault growth\nWe have argued the case for syn-sedimentary growth of polygonal faults, whereby after an initial phase, the upper tip is constantly at or close to the sediment-water interface. This argument is founded in the many previous observations of PFSs in previous studies that have demonstrated growth packages, or anomalously high expansion indices or displacement gradients, or more tellingly, shown the upper tips to crop out as surface scarps (King and Cartwright, 2020, and references therein). Our model outputs consistently show that the locus of maximum throw at any increment in time migrates upwards in tandem with the general burial and addition of sediment layers to the upper boundary of the tier (Fig. 10). In short, as the tier grows vertically, the faults propagate upwards and the Tmax position also migrates upwards. The final position of the Tmax does not therefore coincide with a nucleation position in the tier as has been suggested (Watterson et al., 2000; Wrona et al., 2017; Turrini et al., 2017) but is a final snapshot of a transient, migratory process. The upward migration of the Tmax position with growth for polygonal faults was first suggested by Morgan et al. (2015), and this proposition is therefore confirmed by our modelling.\nOne other aspect of the gross kinematics of polygonal faults is that of the rate of accumulation of displacement. Until recently, this important parameter was unquantified for polygonal faults, but King and Cartwright (2020) were able to correlate markers from Ocean Drilling Project cores and from these measure displacement rates of the order of 1\u201310\u00a0m\/m.y. The throw rates derived from our models are consistent with those recorded from the upper tips of their surface-breaching polygonal faults in the V\u00f8ring Basin. It is worth noting that those faults are hosted in a tier with similar sedimentation rates to those used in our models, and it is tempting to speculate that displacement rates for faults undergoing some form of fault-perturbed differential compaction would most likely scale with sedimentation (loading) rates.\n\n\n4.4\nLimitations with the modelling\nOur modelling strategy did not attempt to replicate the three-dimensional complexity of intersecting polygonal fault geometries (Lonergan et al., 1998a) or heterogeneities between units that comprise a PFS tier (Cartwright et al., 2003; Verschuren, 2019). We characterised our models with a single continuous fault plane with a uniform residual friction angle over its entire surface. However, outcrop observations of polygonal faults show that the fault zones may comprise a multitude of smaller fractures and splays (Verschuren, 1990; Hibsch et al., 2003; Tewksbury et al., 2014; Fa\u00ff-Gomord et al., 2017; Verschuren, 2019) that would aggregate to give the appearance of a single plane at the resolution limits of seismic reflection data. These heterogeneities and fault intersections may explain the differences between the smoothly tapering throw profiles produced in our simulations (Fig. 19) and the jagged or stepped throw profiles recorded from polygonal faults imaged in seismic reflection data (Neagu et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2015; Turrini et al., 2017; Wrona et al., 2017). However, despite the relative homogeneity of our models compared to real PFS tiers, our results successfully reproduce the \u2018C-, M-, and L-shaped\u2019 geometries of polygonal fault throw profiles.\nOne of the main limitations of this study was that we did not explicitly investigate the role of overpressure. Elevated fluid pressure may facilitate the episodic growth of some polygonal faults at higher residual friction angles, and contribute to the growth of polygonal faults that span ultra-low permeability fine-grained units which may experience periods of compaction disequilibrium. If, for example, a polygonal fault ceases its growth because of an increase in the fault friction angle, then fluid pressure may build with increasing burial depth in undrained units until the fluid pressure acting on the fault plane reduces the effective mean stress sufficiently to facilitate frictional sliding at low shear stresses (Bolton et al., 1998; Watterson et al., 2000), thus reactivating fault growth. It is worth noting that overpressured mobile units found at the base of fine-grained sedimentary tiers may act as d\u00e9collement surfaces and these overpressured unit have been suggested as a means to nucleate PFS (Watterson et al., 2000). However, investigating the nucleation of PFS was beyond the scope of this study, which focused solely on the drivers of post-nucleation growth.\n\n\n4.5\nWider implications of the modelling results\nThe arrest and termination of activity on the constituent faults (\u2018death\u2019) making up a PFS may occur once the host sedimentary units no longer undergo differential volumetric strain. This may occur from the base of the tier upwards in a burial conveyor-belt like fashion, or in a single fossilisation phase. The slowing and ultimate cessation of differential volumetric strain may occur as frictional sliding is inhibited by an increase in the residual friction angle and\/or the slowing of volumetric change of the host units caused by lithification. The upward termination of a PFS may also occur because of a depositional facies change (Cartwright et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2014), and the growth of individual polygonal faults within a PFS may be inhibited by the intersection of neighbouring faults (Lonergan et al., 1998a). Fluctuations in the overburden loading rate (both erosional and depositional) may also influence the growth of PFSs. Faster sedimentation rates may increase the rate of compaction in drained conditions or drive overpressure in undrained conditions, therefore driving faster throw rates but also greater PFS tier heights (c.f. the empirical scaling relationship established by Shin et al. (2010)). Erosional events or depositional hiatuses may, on the other hand, limit the subsequent accrual of differential compaction until the pre-erosional maximum effective stress is reached following re-loading, in which time the material physical properties may have changed to inhibit further differential compaction. In summary, the temporal evolution of individual polygonal faults within a tier may be governed by many factors. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that the growth of polygonal faults is primarily driven by low residual friction angles on dipping fault planes which facilitate differential compaction.\nIn summary, the results presented in this study strongly suggest that the growth of normal faults hosted in laterally-pinned sedimentary tiers can be solely facilitated by gravity-driven differential compaction at low residual friction angles. A gravity-driven differential compaction mechanism is likely the overarching driver of the growth of polygonal fault systems universally, where processes such as overpressure and diagenetically-induced volumetric reductions may act as secondary and tertiary contributing factors, respectively, to enhance or reactivate polygonal faults in some circumstances. In addition to the growth of PFSs, a differential compaction mechanism may also explain why up-dip extensional strains are consistently greater than down-dip compressional strains recorded in shallowly buried gravitational-slope fault systems found on continental shelves (Dalton et al., 2015).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, we modelled the growth of an isolated fault hosted within laterally-pinned conditions with respect to variable material compaction profiles, residual friction angles, and fault dip angles, using a suite of two-dimensional finite element forward models constructed in ELFEN, that coupled upward fault propagation with simultaneous sedimentation and compaction of unconsolidated fine-grained granular sediment. Our results show for the first time, that faults hosted in laterally-pinned conditions \u2013 such as those that host polygonal fault systems \u2013 can accumulate throw solely through gravity-driven differential compaction under realistic physical property and burial conditions.\nThe main findings of this study are:\n\n(1)\nPolygonal fault systems grow as the result of gravity-driven differential compaction at low residual friction angles.\n\n\n(2)\nMaximum throw (Tmax) as a percentage of fault height values recorded from polygonal fault systems globally (\u223c6%) can be achieved at standard fault dip angles and material property values typical of those recorded from fine-grained sediments at residual friction angles <9\u00b0.\n\n\n(3)\nThrow rates derived from our sensitivity analysis (0\u201310.45\u00a0m\/m.y.) are consistent with recently recorded ultra-slow throw rates from the upper tips of polygonal faults in the V\u00f8ring Basin, Norwegian Sea (1.4\u201310.9\u00a0m\/m.y).\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\nJames J.

Generally, the fault trace is an element easy to identify as it corresponds to a discontinuity. However, the direction and sense of fault displacement is usually more difficult to determine as, in many cases, no kinematic criteria are available (e.g., striations on the fault plane). It is even more complicated to estimate the net slip as two homologous points on both fault blocks need to be known. Nevertheless, it is common to quickly classify faults according to the offset we observe, even in the absence of clear kinematic criteria. For example, if a fault crops out on a vertical slope or cliff and the same layer appears at a higher elevation in the hanging wall than in the footwall, we conclude that the fault is reverse, while if the layer is located at a lower elevation in the hanging wall than in the footwall, we assume that the fault is normal. If on a geological map the fault hanging wall is formed by older rocks than those in the footwall, we conclude that the fault is reverse, while if they are younger, we assume that it is a normal fault. Thus, we usually base our fault classification on the observed separation of planar markers, in this case bedding, i.e., the distance between two parts of a horizon disrupted by a fault measured in a particular direction. These deductions are correct when the displaced marker is a horizontal surface before fault generation or it strikes to the same direction than the fault, however, when the planar marker had a previous dip and its strike is different from that of the fault, these deductions may be incorrect, and therefore, a classification based on separation may lead to incorrect structural interpretations (Fig. 1\n). This matter is particularly sensitive in the case of seismic profiles as data are 2D and it is difficult to obtain kinematic indicators. The concepts of slip and separation are well known from classical works of the past century (e.g., Reid et al., 1913; Straley, 1934; Crowell, 1959; Billings, 1972) and they have been extensively discussed in most Structural Geology books. One of the most interesting contributions on the separation and slip in faults is that of Ragan (2009). This author proposed constructing fault plane views in order to visualize the geometrical effects of the displacement and made an analysis of separation of a planar marker versus the cut-off line of the planar marker on the fault plane and the slip vector.\nWorking on coastal outcrops of Lower Jurassic rocks in the Asturian Basin, NW Iberian Peninsula, where some faults cut and offset inclined layers and kinematic criteria are available, we recognised faults whose separation disagrees with slip. This motivated us to recall this topic and discuss these relationships, create a tool to make easier the analysis of the relationship between slip and separation, and illustrate these situations using field examples. The tool consists of graphs relating the angle between the cut-off line of a surface on the fault plane and the slip vector. In addition, we have developed a Python script that plots field data on the graphs presented in this paper and constructs simple geological maps and sections across the faults, as well as fault plane views as proposed in Ragan (2009). Our analysis applies to faults whose motion does not involve rotation of the fault blocks, and is based on the current disposition of the elements displaced by the fault, but it does not consider whether the final disposition is due to a single fault motion event or due to fault reactivation.\nThe Asturian Basin, located in the northwestern portion of the Iberian Peninsula, is a Permian-Mesozoic extensional basin partially inverted during a Cenozoic contractional event. The Mesozoic extensional events led to folds related to normal faults, while the Cenozoic contractional event, which took place during the Alpine orogenesis, is characterised, among other structures, by reverse and strike-slip faults superimposed to Mesozoic structures (Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990; Uzkeda, 2013; Uzkeda et al., 2013, 2016). The angular relationships between the Mesozoic folds and the Cenozoic faults are very varied because the Mesozoic structures strike NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W. The Asturian coast contains exceptional top-views and cross-sectional exposures of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin by the Cantabrian Sea (Mart\u00edn et al., 2013; Uzkeda et al., 2018, 2022). The excellent quality outcrops combined with the use of traditional and digital geological mapping, as well as the construction and interpretation of virtual outcrop models (Xu et al., 2000) of this region has allowed us to perform a high-resolution geological analysis. This approach has provided measurements and observations at different scales and bed-by-bed resolution, so that we are able to identify the same layers and structures in both fault blocks. This makes it possible to determine without any uncertainty the type of fault and estimate the dip and strike separations, i.e., the distance of formerly adjacent beds on either side of a fault surface, measured along the dip of the fault or measured along strike of the fault respectively.\nThe most common way to proceed in order to determine the different cases resulting from the interaction of two elements consists of modifying one element, the other, and finally both. Although apparently in the study of relationships between faults and layers there are only two elements, unfortunately, there are too many parameters to be considered, both in the case of faults (orientation, type of fault according to its displacement, magnitude of displacement, etc.) and in the case of tilted\/folded layers (orientation of beds, axial surfaces and fold axes, interlimb angle, fold geometry, etc.), to analyse their effect one by one. In this paper, we will check how the variation of the parameters, which we consider most important, influences our perception of the type of fault. First, we will examine a simple and, in our opinion, very illustrative case, since it may be relatively common for a geologist to map faults in the field that cut and offset layers with a certain previous dip. Next, we will explore what happens when faults cut and offset folds. We will show different implications derived from the modification of the different parameters related to faults and layers using sections and geological maps, since they are two of the most used techniques in Geology to represent the geometry of geological bodies.\n\n\n2\nFaults displacing previously inclined layers\nIn this section, we analyse the most important parameters that influence the dip and strike fault separation that one can see in cross section and in map respectively, as well as derived implications from variation of these parameters. Finally, we present a perfectly bounded field example and two theoretical examples.\n\n2.1\nGeological cross-sections and maps\nIn a region where layers exhibit a normal polarity and are horizontal or their strike is the same than that of the fault, the sense of dip separation shown in a section across the fault is consistent with the slip of the fault. That is, in dipping faults, reverse faults place hanging wall older rocks over footwall younger rocks, normal faults place hanging wall younger rocks over footwall older rocks, and strike-slip faults cause no dip separation. However, in those cases where bedding was tilted before fault development and its strike is not parallel to that of the fault, the fault may show confusing dip separations (Fig. 1). Thus, a reverse fault may appear as a normal fault or vice versa, and a strike-slip fault may appear as a reverse or normal fault. To show how the fault dip separation would look like in cross sections perpendicular to the fault strike, we have constructed a graph (Fig. 2\nb). In this graph, we have represented the different types of faults according to their kinematics based on the pitch of the net-slip vector (or in other words, the pitch of linear kinematic indicators, such as fault striations, on the fault surface) as a function of bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane. The parameters used in this graph are illustrated in Fig. 2a. The analysis of this graph has allowed us to draw the conclusions set out below.\n\n1)\nIf the slip vector and the bedding cut-off lines are parallel, any fault, irrespective of the type of fault (reverse, normal, strike-slip or oblique), will appear as a strike-slip fault in cross section, i.e., same age hanging wall and footwall rocks will be located at the same height, and therefore, the fault dip separation will be zero (Fig. 1a, blue lines in Fig. 2b). In all other cases, however, the faults will show normal or reverse dip separation.\n\n\n2)\nDip-slip, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults with a normal component will show normal dip separation except when the slip vector pitches in the same direction than the bedding cut-off lines at a smaller angle (measured from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) than that of the bedding cut-off lines. Similarly, dip-slip, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults with a reverse component will show reverse dip separation except when the slip vector pitches in the same direction than the bedding cut-off lines at a smaller angle than that of the bedding cut-off lines (Figs. 1b and 2b).\n\n\n\nSimilarly to cross-sections, in geological maps there are also cases where the fault strike separation disagrees with the fault slip. We have constructed a graph to show how the fault strike separation would look like in maps (Fig. 2c). In this graph, we have represented the different types of faults according to their kinematics based on the pitch of the net-slip vector (i.e., the pitch of linear kinematic indicators such as fault striations) versus the pith of the bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane. Different situations, briefly described below, occur.\n\n1)\nIf the fault slip vector and the bedding cut-off lines are parallel, any type of fault (reverse, normal, strike-slip and oblique) will show no strike separation, so that it will appear on the map as if the fault caused no movement (Fig. 1a). In all other cases, faults will display strike separations other than zero (Fig. 2c).\n\n\n2)\nApart from the case described above, faults will show strike separations consistent with fault slip except when the fault slip vector pitches in the same direction than the bedding cut-off lines at a greater angle than that of the bedding cut-off lines, then the fault strike separation will disagree with the fault slip. Thus, a fault with a left-lateral component will exhibit a right strike separation on the map, whereas a fault with a right-lateral component of motion will appear as a fault with left strike separation on the map (Figs. 1c and 2c).\n\n\n\nTo visualize the particular case of pure strike-slip faults, we have created a diagram including maps and cross sections that takes into account fault dip and bedding dip, and whether faults are right-lateral or left-lateral (Fig. 3\n).\nTwo particular cases need to be explained separately.\n\n1)\nIn relation to the dip of the faults. Vertical faults have neither hanging wall nor footwall. Fault block motion in vertical faults is usually identified using cardinal points instead of the classical classification of normal or reverse faults (although they can still be labelled as right or left-lateral faults), and therefore, the graphs in Fig. 2 are not appropriate for vertical faults. Horizontal faults, although they do have hanging wall and footwall, their movement refers to cardinal points instead of the classical classification of normal, reverse, etc. faults. Again, the graphs in Fig. 2 do not seem to be appropriate for horizontal faults. To be able to plot these faults in Fig. 2 graphs we suggest assuming that vertical faults are not strictly vertical, but have a dip of 89.9\u00b0, while horizontal faults would be assigned a dip of 0.1\u00b0. Since natural fault surfaces are usually not perfect planes but rather irregular surfaces, this assumption seems reasonable.\n\n\n2)\nIn relation to the orientation of the layers. When the layers are parallel to the observation plane, i.e., to the section plane in the case of geological cross-sections or to the map plane in the case of geological maps, then different layers appear in both fault blocks. Unfortunately, in these cases it is impossible to determine neither the dip separation nor the strike separation, and therefore, the graphs in Fig. 2 cannot be used.\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the influence of different parameters on the magnitude of dip separation, we will consider a simple case of a vertical strike-slip fault that offsets a previously dipping bed whose dip ranges from more than 0\u00b0 to less than 90\u00b0. Since it is impossible to examine all possible situations, we will vary three different parameters and analyse qualitatively the behaviour of these variations. To do so, we will use a dip separation versus strike separation graph for different pitch values of bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane (Fig. 4\n). The parameters we will modify are the angle between the fault strike and the bedding strike, the dip of the layers, and the fault slip (or separation, as it is a pure strike-slip fault and its strike separation coincides with slip). The conclusions obtained are listed below.\n\n1)\nWhen the angle between the bedding strike and the fault strike decreases, keeping constant the bedding dip and the fault slip, then the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines decreases and the dip separation we see in cross section decreases as well (path illustrated by green arrows in Fig. 4a and b).\n\n\n2)\nWhen the bedding dip increases, keeping constant the angle between the bedding strike and the fault strike as well as the fault slip, then the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines increases and the dip separation we see in cross section also increases (path illustrated by blue arrows in Fig. 4a and b).\n\n\n3)\nWhen the fault slip increases, keeping constant the angle between the bedding strike and the fault strike as well as the bedding dip, the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines remains constant but the dip separation viewed in cross section increases (path illustrated by red arrows in Fig. 4a and b).\n\n\n\nThe conclusions explained above derive from cases in which we only vary one of the parameters and the rest remain constant. However, from the graph in Fig. 4a, conclusions can be drawn for cases in which more than one parameter varies. For instance, for the same increase in strike separation, the larger the pitch of the cut-off lines on the fault surface the larger the dip separation increase.\n\n\n2.2\nField example\nThe selected field example is located in the southeastern part of Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach, Gij\u00f3n (Asturias) by the Cantabrian Sea (Fig. 5\na). The Jurassic rocks that crop out in the Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach belong to the northern part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin and consist of alternations of limestones and marls. In this region, mapped in Beroiz et al. (1972), Guti\u00e9rrez Claverol et al. (2002), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) and Odriozola (2016), there is an E-W to WNW-ESE fault, whose trace is approximately rectilinear in map view and reaches a few hectometres length along strike (Fig. 5b). The fault surface dips steeply to the SSW (Fig. 6\na), although locally it can dip to the NNE (Fig. 5d). This fault offsets a N\u2013S syncline causing a right strike separation on the geological map (Fig. 5b). Low-pitch slickensides (18\u00b0 W) recognised on the fault surface indicate right-lateral slip with a small normal component (Fig. 5d). To estimate the net-slip value and its pitch on the fault surface, one fault-parallel section across the hanging wall and another across the footwall have been constructed both adjacent to the fault (dashed blue and red lines in Fig. 5b). Both sections have been overlapped using a reference point of known coordinates in order to construct an Allan map (Allan, 1989) (Fig. 5e). The hinge of the syncline developed at the same horizon in both fault blocks has been taken as homologous points in the Allan map. The distance between these two homologous points on the Allan map is the net slip and its dip is the pitch of the net slip. The net slip obtained is 38.7\u00a0m, the strike slip is 38.1\u00a0m, the dip slip is about 4.4\u00a0m and the pitch of the net slip is almost 9.5\u00b0 to the W, i.e., it is a strike-slip fault. The net-slip pitch and the fault motion sense calculated using homologous points on both fault blocks depicted in the Allan map (Fig. 5e) coincide with the pitch and direction of movement deduced from the slickensides measured on the fault plane in the field (Fig. 5d). The calculated net-slip pitch and the pitch measured in the field using kinematic indicators are not identical because the pitch of the slickensides corresponds to values measured at specific locations and neither the fault surface is a perfect plane nor the slickensides are perfectly rectilinear, and because the calculated net-slip corresponds to the final displacement vector that may be the result of the sum of different fault motion pulses with similar orientation slickensides but not strictly parallel. Thus, both the theoretical calculations and the kinematic indicators, clearly show that this fault is an almost pure right-lateral strike-slip fault with a slight normal component. However, on the coastal cliff, which is approximately vertical and almost perpendicular to the fault strike, this fault appears as a reverse fault with a dip separation of approximately 1.5\u00a0m (Fig. 6a). The calculated pitch of the net slip, the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane (estimated on the equal-area projection illustrated in Fig. 5d using bedding and fault field measurements), as well as the calculated value of strike separation, have been plotted on the graphs in Figs. 2 and 4. The graphs in Fig. 2, the map and cross section outputs of the Python script (Figs. 5c and 6b) and the diagrams shown in Fig. 3 confirm that the fault analysed, despite being an almost pure right-lateral strike-slip fault with a slight normal component, should appear as a reverse fault in cross section, while the graph in Fig. 4a and the cross section derived from the Phyton script (Fig. 6b) confirm that its dip separation should be around 1.5\u00a0m as shown in the field photograph depicted in Fig. 6a.\n\n\n2.3\nTheoretical examples\nIn order to show examples of faults whose motion does not cause displacement of the layers on the map, or causes apparent displacement of the layers on the map contrary to the actual fault motion, geological cross-sections and maps of two theoretical examples constructed with the Python script developed are presented below.\nThe first example is a left-lateral fault with a slight normal component (equal-area plot in Fig. 7\na). The bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane are almost parallel to the net slip, as shown by the plot of the fault data on the graphs in Fig. 2b and c. This causes that, regardless of the magnitude of motion along the fault, this fault does not offset the layers neither in the geological cross-section nor in the geological map (Fig. 7a).\nThe second example is a right-lateral fault with a slight normal component (equal-area plot in Fig. 7b). The pitch of the bedding cut-off lines on the fault plane is greater than the pitch of the net slip, as shown by the data plotted on the graphs in Fig. 2b and c. Thus, although in the geological cross-section the fault shows a small normal dip separation consistent with the actual net-slip, on the geological map it exhibits a left strike separation although the fault is really right-lateral (Fig. 7b).\n\n\n\n3\nFaults displacing previously folded layers\n\n3.1\nGeological maps\nImagine a region where cylindrical folds, with axes parallel to the strike of the axial planes, are cut and offset by a fault whose strike is parallel to the axial plane strike and the dip of both the axial planes and the fault are constant along strike. In this particular situation, the fault maintains the same character along its entire trace, i.e., the geological map shows a fault in which the oldest rocks are always in one fault block and the youngest rocks in the other. However, in other cases there may be segments of the same fault where the oldest rocks are in one fault block and segments where the oldest rocks are in the other fault block. To illustrate these situations in map view, we have assumed that the folds have a kink-chevron geometry and we have constructed a graph (Fig. 8\n) in which the x axis represents different types of faults according to their kinematics based on the pitch of the slip vector (i.e., kinematic indicators), and the y axis is the pitch of the axial planes cut-off lines on the fault plane. The following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of this graph.\n\n1)\nRegardless of the type of fault considered, when the slip vector and the axial plane cut-off lines are parallel, the faults maintain the same character along strike on a geological map (blue lines in Fig. 8).\n\n\n2)\nIn all other cases, regardless of the fault type, the faults may have segments where older rocks are located in one fault block and younger rocks in the other, and segments where the opposite situation occurs. Those fault segments where older rocks are in the hanging wall and younger ones in the footwall exhibit an apparent reverse displacement, whereas those fault segments where younger rocks are in the hanging wall and older ones in the footwall exhibit an apparent normal displacement (Fig. 8). In the case of strictly vertical faults, since there is no hanging wall and footwall, we could only speak of younger or older rocks in one or the other fault block.\n\n\n\nThere are many parameters that influence the width of the apparently reverse fault segments and that of the apparently normal fault segments along the same fault, and therefore, it is difficult to consider all the different situations. Thus, we propose to explore a simple case; a fold train formed by equally spaced anticlines and synclines with horizontal fold axes and vertical axial surfaces cut and offset by a pure strike-slip fault. The folds are cylindrical, their geometrical features are identical and the topographical surface is flat. The results will be shown using a graph which relates the width of the apparently reverse and apparently normal fault segments versus the fault strike separation for different distances between fold hinges measured parallel to the fault (Fig. 9\n). The basic parameters we will modify are the angle between the fault strike and the folds, the fault displacement, and the distance between fold hinges measured parallel to the fault trace. The results derived from the graph analysis are briefly explained below.\n\n1)\nIf we keep constant the fault strike separation but the angle between the fault strike and the folds decreases, then the distance between fold hinges measured parallel to the fault trace increases, so that the width of the apparently reverse and normal fault segments increases as well (path illustrated by green arrows in Fig. 9a and b).\n\n\n2)\nWhen the distance between fold hinges increases, keeping constant the fault strike separation, as well as the angle between the fault strike and the folds, then the width of the apparently reverse and normal fault segments increases (path illustrated by blue arrows in Fig. 9a and b).\n\n\n3)\nWhen the fault strike separation increases, keeping constant the angle between the fault strike and the folds, as well as the distance between fold hinges, the width of the apparently reverse and normal fault segments remains constant, except when the fault strike separation is a multiple of twice the distance between fold hinges; in this particular case the fault appears to have no strike separation (path illustrated by red arrows in Fig. 9a and b).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nField example\nThe fault we will analyse in this section is located a few hundred metres farther north than the fault described above (Fig. 5a). It has an E-W to WNW-ESE strike and very steep dip both towards the N and S (Fig. 10\n), predominantly towards the S, and cuts and offsets a NNE-SSW fold train. This fault displays a slightly corrugated map trace and hectometric length along strike (Fig. 10a). The low pitch slickensides identified on the fault surface, together with some right-lateral shear zones, indicate right-lateral fault motion (Fig. 10b). According to the geological map (Fig. 10a), the axial trace of the westernmost NNE-SSW fold is curved near the fault, which is interpreted as a drag fold consistent with a right-lateral fault movement. We have calculated the coordinates of the intersection point between the fault and an axis of an anticline developed in a horizon located in the north fault block, and the coordinates of the intersection point between the fault and the same fold developed in the same horizon in the south fault block. Since these two points correspond to homologous points in both fault blocks, this has made it possible to determine the fault net-slip, its pitch and the fault motion sense. The calculated net-slip is 33.5\u00a0m, the strike slip is almost 33.5\u00a0m, the dip slip is slightly greater than 1\u00a0m and the net-slip pitch is almost 2.3\u00b0 (Fig. 10c); thus, the fault is a strike-slip fault, in particular a right-lateral fault. The net-slip pitch and the sense of fault movement obtained using homologous points on the two fault blocks (Fig. 10c), coincide with the pitch and direction of movement obtained from the kinematic indicators measured in the field (Fig. 10b). As in the case of the fault described above, the calculated pitch of the net slip and that of the kinematic indicators measured in the field are not identical because the slickensides have been measured in different locations and the fault surface is not a perfect plane, and because the calculated net-slip is the final displacement vector that may result from the sum of different fault motion pulses with not strictly parallel slickensides. The geological map shows that there are fault segments in which younger rocks are located in the northern block, i.e., the footwall, while older rocks are located in the southern block, i.e., the hanging wall, and therefore, the fault would behave as an apparent reverse fault (Fig. 11\n). However, there are segments where the opposite situation occurs, i.e., older rocks located in the northern fault block (footwall) are directly in contact with younger rocks located in the southern fault block (hanging wall), and thus the fault would behave apparently as a normal fault (Fig. 11). The segments where the fault acts as an apparent reverse fault and those where it acts as an apparent normal fault are separated by null points (term adapted from Williams et al., 1989, originally applied to inversion tectonics) in which the outcropping layers in the northern and southern fault blocks have the same age, and therefore, no strike separation occurs at these points. The calculated pitch of the net slip, pitch of the axial plane cut-off lines on the fault plane, the strike separation and the distance between fold hinges displaced by this fault have been plotted on the graphs in Figs. 8 and 9. On the one hand, the graph in Fig. 8 verifies that this fault shows apparently reverse and apparently normal segments along strike, as expected, since the slip vector and the axial plane cut-off lines are not parallel. On the other hand, the graph in Fig. 9 tells us that the width of the apparently reverse and apparently normal fault segments should be slightly greater than 30\u00a0m in the eastern portion of the fault and slightly greater than 10\u00a0m in the western part of the fault, as shown in the geological map (Fig. 10a).\n\n\n\n4\nApplications\nFrom our point of view, the graphs presented here can be used in different ways.\n\n1)\nAs a tool to improve our structural interpretations in cases where observations are apparently contradictory. For example, if we see a reverse fault on a slope and a fault with strike-slip kinematic indicators on a flat region but the outcrops between the slope and the flat area are covered by vegetation, we may conclude that they are two different faults. Alternatively, if we see a strike-slip fault in a flat region and its continuation on the slope becomes a reverse fault, we may conclude that it is a reactivated fault. In these cases, the graphs presented can help us to determine whether they are indeed two different faults or they are the same fault in the first example, and whether it is a reactivated fault or it fits an interpretation based on a single movement in the second example.\n\n\n2)\nFrom the predictive point of view in regions where we know that faults cut and offset previously tilted and\/or folded layers. Thus, if we have information in geological map format as well as fault kinematic indicators, the graphs can help us to predict what type of fault dip separation will be expected in geological cross-sections. In the same way, if the information we have comes from sections across faults based on outcrops in road slopes, cliffs, mountain slopes, etc. the graphs can be useful to construct the geological map since they will allow us to infer what type of strike separation will be expected for the faults. If fault kinematic indicators are not available in the study area, the graphs could be used to constrain possible pitches of the net slip as long as the orientation of the fault plane and the layers, as well as geological cross-sections and map views of the faults, are available. This exercise could be also carried out using 3D seismic data. The procedure would consist of calculating the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines from the orientation of the layers and the fault. Next, determine the type of fault dip separation in cross section (normal, reverse or no separation) and the type of fault strike separation on the map (left, right or no separation). Next, a horizontal line corresponding to the pitch of the bedding cut-off lines should be drawn on the graphs of Fig. 2b and c only in the fields whose type of dip and strike separation coincides with the type of dip and strike separations determined. The horizontal line segments whose position is identical in both graphs will give us possible values of net-slip pitch and possible types of faults.\n\n\n3)\nTo check whether in a region the layers were tilted and\/or folded before fault development. For instance, if the kinematic indicators tell us that a fault is a strike-slip fault, but the same fault appears as a reverse fault in cross section or it displays apparent reverse or normal segments along its map trace, the graphs might be used to check whether the type of fault determined based on the kinematic indicators is consistent with the type of dip and strike separation observed in the geological cross-sections and maps. If so, this confirms the presence of tilted and\/or folded layers before fault development. If not, another hypothesis needs to be formulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nA correct classification of faults, based on their kinematics, requires a three-dimensional thinking. However, data are commonly obtained in two dimensions, and therefore, it is necessary to analyse geological maps and cross-sections when trying to unravel the structural history of a region. This type of exercise is usually carried out to decipher the fault type when no kinematic indicators are available. However, this analysis is not usually performed when kinematic elements are available, such as fault striations, homologous points on both fault blocks, etc., since they provide us incontestable information about the movement along faults, and therefore, we are generally satisfied with this information. What we want to emphasise here is that we recommend to carry out analyses of geological maps and sections across faults also in those cases where kinematic indicators associated with fault motion are available, as both are complementary techniques and may supply additional information.\nFurthermore, although geological maps and sections are very old techniques, this work shows that they are still essential tools not only for the representation, visualization and understanding of the structure of a region, but also for deciphering the occurrence of deformational events prior to the development of faults.\nThis work is a first approach to the problem of apparently confusing situations in faults that cut and offset previously tilted and\/or folded layers. However, to understand the full spectrum of possibilities there are still many parameters to be explored, such as the variation of fault slip along dip and\/or strike, different geometries of folds or folds with inverted limbs amongst other parameters.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nMarta Mag\u00e1n: Methodology, Software, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.\n\nJosep Poblet: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing - original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\nMayte Bulnes: Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Resources, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition.\n\n","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFlanking structures (Passchier, 2001; Grasemann and St\u00fcwe, 2001) are deflections of an existing planar fabric (e.g., foliation) alongside a cross-cutting element (CE; e.g., a vein) that can develop in a wide range of rock types, ranging from eclogites to unconsolidated sediments, and also glacier ice (e.g. Hamblin, 1965; Hudleston, 1989; Passchier et al., 2008). The classification scheme of flanking structures proposed by Grasemann et al. (2003) utilises the sense of drag and the offset of a central marker line along a CE with respect to the overall shear sense of the shear zone. On the basis of these parameters the family of flanking structures can be divided into extensional shear bands, contractional and extensional flanking folds with an antithetic offset (a-type) and contractional flanking folds with a synthetic offset (s-type), all of which can exhibit reverse or normal drag of the central marker. An alternative classification system for flanking structures, which is exclusively based on geometric criteria, was proposed by Coelho et al. (2005).\nThe instantaneous behaviour and progressive development of flanking structures in different rheologies around isolated and multiple, mechanically interacting CEs was elucidated by physical analogue, analytical and numerical models (Hudleston, 1989; Grasemann and St\u00fcwe, 2001; Grasemann et al., 2003, 2019; Exner et al., 2004, 2006; Kocher and Mancktelow, 2006; Mulchrone, 2007; Fletcher, 2009; Exner and Dabrowski, 2010; Adamuszek and Dabrowski, 2017). However, all these studies focused on modelling of flanking structures under simple shear or transpressional general shear. An exception are the low-strain numerical models by Wiesmayr and Grasemann (2005), who suggested that transtensional flanking structures must also exist in nature. The main outcome of their modelling is that transtension promotes the development of a- and s-type flanking folds, but impedes the development of shear bands.\nThe present study describes transtensional flanking structures in glacier ice, which is practically speaking a monomineralic, metamorphic rock analogue that, in temperate glaciers, deforms at the pressure melting point. The rheological behaviour of ice is described by power-law creep (Glen's flow law; Glen, 1955), with an average power-law exponent of n\u00a0=\u00a03, although the dominant deformation mechanism depends on other factors, such as temperature, grain size, and strain rate. Analogies between structures in ice and rocks have been made by many authors (e.g., Hambrey, 1975, 1977; Hambrey and Milnes, 1975; Hooke and Hudleston, 1978; Kamb et al., 1985; Hudleston, 1989; Lawson et al., 1994), from the scale of a crystal (Wilson and Russell-Head, 1979; Montagnat et al., 2014) to tectonic systems (Sharp et al., 1988; Herbst and Neubauer, 2000). Comprehensive reviews of the discipline \u2018structural glaciology\u2019 are given by Hambrey and Lawson (2000), Hudleston (2015) and Jennings and Hambrey (2021).\nThroughout this paper, transpressional and transtensional shear flow is, for the sake of simplicity, referred to as transpression and transtension, rather than narrowing and broadening sub-simple shearing, respectively (Simpson and De Paor, 1993), which also corresponds to type D plane strain transpression\/transtension (Fossen and Tikoff, 1998). Clearly, plane strain deformation is an idealised concept that is rarely encountered in nature and triclinic flow (Lin et al., 1998) may result in complex progressive deformation, such as the formation of triclinic and\/or highly non-cylindrical structures (e.g., Exner and Dabrowski, 2010; Adamuszek and Dabrowski, 2017). Nevertheless, the flanking structures in glacier ice described in the present study can, at least qualitatively, be reproduced via plane strain numerical modelling, and the spatial variation of the CE orientations can be explained by a plane strain kinematic model. More realistic modelling and analyses that acknowledge the three-dimensional nature and mechanics of glacier flow are beyond the scope of the present study.\n\n\n2\nStudy area and methods\nThe Pasterze Glacier, with a length of 8.3 km, an area of 17.3 km2 and a volume of 1.7 km3 (in 2006; Lieb and Slupetzky, 2011), is the largest glacier in Austria and is located in the Penninic Tauern Window (Carinthia, Austria), just north of Austria's highest mountain, the Gro\u00dfglockner (3798\u00a0m a. s. l. UTM33, 324924E, 5216028N). The glacier can be divided into three areas (Fig. 1\n): (1) a wide accumulation area (Germ. Pasterzenboden, meaning \u201cPasterze's floor\u201d), (2) a steep icefall (Germ. Hufeisenbruch, meaning \u201chorseshoe-break\u201d, since in the past it was continuous and horseshoe-shaped) and (3) a gently sloping glacier tongue (the Pasterze sensu stricto). Since its last highstand of 1850 AD the Pasterze has been dramatically retreating (see Gspurning et al., 2004, and references therein) and in non-steady-state, with a response time of 34\u201350 years (Zuo and Oerlemans, 1997). The equilibrium line is currently above the top of the icefall. The orographic right part of the glacier tongue is covered with debris, resulting in lower ablation rates that hence affect the glacier's morphology (Kellerer-Pirklbauer et al., 2008). The recent glacier's recession is well documented on the basis of aerial surveys and photogrammetric mapping (Kaufmann et al., 2015).\nSeveral structural glaciology studies were conducted on the Pasterze Glacier, such as the pioneering work on the foliation in glacier ice by Schwarzacher and Untersteiner (1953) and Untersteiner (1955), mapping of macroscopic structures (Herbst and Neubauer, 2000), structural interpretation from historic maps and aerial photographs (Herbst et al., 2006) and mapping of dominant structures from orthophotos and digital elevation models (Kellerer-Pirklbauer and Kulmer, 2019). These studies revealed that the glacier tongue comprises three flow units that form by confluence in the icefall; the orographic left unit is the widest and delineated from the central unit by a medial moraine, whereas the right unit is nowadays fully debris-covered (Fig. 2\n).\nThe present study focuses on mapping and analysing structures within a ca. 1.4 km long area located in the upper reaches of the glacier tongue which are not affected by collapse features, such as ice cauldrons forming by the collapse of ice overlying supraglacial meltwater channels (Figs. 1 and 2). In the summers of 2016\u20132020, mapping was carried out with the aid of high-resolution drone photogrammetry (see Appendix A for details) and the structures\u2019 orientations were measured using traditional field techniques. Annual position measurements of a stake network were utilized to determine mean annual velocities and strain rates (see Appendix B for details).\n\n\n3\nStructural assemblage\n\n3.1\nMorphology, velocities and strain rates\nIn the upper reaches of the study area, the glacier is ca. 300 m wide and its surface is relatively steep (ca. 15\u00b0), with an annual flow velocity of 27\u00a0m\/a (see Table B1\n for stake data). It widens down-glacier to a width of ca. 700 m and its surface becomes shallowly inclined (ca. 5\u00b0), with annual flow velocities gradually decreasing to about 5\u00a0m\/a (Fig. 2). Maximum shortening rate orientations in the glacier's central region are parallel to the overall flow direction and their magnitudes decrease down-glacier from \u22121.5\u00d7 10\u22129 s\u22121 (\u22120.05 a\u22121) to about \u22122.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 s\u22121 (\u22120.008 a\u22121). Lower marginal flow velocities lead, as expected, to maximum shortening rate orientations that are, in map view, typically inclined against the shear flow (Fig. 2); the two northernmost strain rates were computed from positions that form obtuse triangles with their long sides sub-parallel to the flow direction, possibly leading to maximum shortening rate orientations that are inconsistent with this general pattern. Although annual velocity directions and magnitudes and the maximum shortening rate orientations are generally consistent with the horizontal flow field of valley glaciers (e.g., Hooke, 2019), the sparse network of stakes does not permit a more detailed description. However, the structural assemblage provides further clues to the glacier's flow field.\n\n\n3.2\nCrevasses\nMany crevasses along the glacier margin are due to collapse over sub-glacial streams. The majority of crevasses are however most likely due to fracture during glacial flow (Fig. 3\na). In the upper reaches of the study area and a few 10s of metres further to the NW, transverse crevasses are present, most likely formed by the glacier's acceleration as it flows down the aforementioned incline. Another transverse crevasse field is located in the SE, close to the study area's lower end. The predominant set comprises splaying crevasses that clearly cut through the boundary between the left and central flow unit, suggesting similarity in rheological behaviour and a smoothly varying stress field between the left and central flow units. They form at an angle of ca. 30\u00b0 to the boundary between the central and right flow unit and curve towards the glacier's centreline where they become parallel to the flow direction and hence longitudinal crevasses (Fig. 3a). This crevasse pattern is consistent with Nye's model that predicts this geometry in the presence of a longitudinal compressive stress (Nye, 1952; Hudleston, 2015; Jennings and Hambrey, 2021). Even though the stake network is sparse, the orientation of the splaying crevasses is consistent with the maximum shortening orientations (Fig. 2; see Harper et al., 1998, and references therein). A quantitative description and an alternative approach for predicting the splaying crevasses' curvature is given in Section 6. A minor crevasse set is orthogonal to the splaying crevasses, which could be referred to as \u2018cross-crevasses\u2019, analogous to orthogonal cross-joints in rock (e.g., Bai et al., 2002), although their origin in glacial ice is yet unexplained.\n\n\n3.3\nFoliation\nThe foliation is the most prominent fabric element in the study area and in the entire glacier tongue. Since the glacier enters the valley via the icefall, it is already foliated; it is doubtful that any traces of primary stratification (\n\n\ns\n0\n\n\n) remain (Hudleston, 2015). The initial planar fabric formed by flow through the icefall is referred to as \n\n\ns\n1\n\n\n. As the glacier flows down the aforementioned incline and decelerates in the shallower region, it forms folds with steeply plunging axes and steeply dipping axial planes striking transverse to flow (coined \u2018mushroom\u2019 folds by Ragan, 1969; see also Hambrey and Lawson, 2000). The folds are well developed in the central area of the left flow unit. The visibility of these folds however strongly depends on light conditions and view angle; they are best seen from the hiking trail \u201cGamsgrubenweg\u201d along the NE side of the valley. These folds tighten due to continued longitudinal shortening and become dismembered as the new foliation \n\n\ns\n2\n\n\n forms further down-glacier. In both flow units, foliation \n\n\ns\n2\n\n\n dips inward and up-glacier, resembling geometrically \u201cnested spoons\u201d (Fig. 3b; Hambrey and Milnes, 1975; Herbst and Neubauer, 2000; Hudleston, 2015). Along the centreline of the left flow unit, the foliation dip decreases from >50\u00b0 to as low as 20\u00b0 down-glacier. The dip increases towards the left margin and at the boundary between the left and central flow unit foliation \n\n\ns\n2\n\n\n is sub-vertical.\n\n\n3.4\nFlanking structures\nThe vast majority of flanking structures are exposed in a ca. 1 km long and 50\u00a0m wide area along the right margin of the left flow unit (Figs. 2 and 3). This area is, due to transverse variations of the horizontal ice flow velocity, subjected to map-view dextral shearing. Later descriptions of CE orientations refer to this overall sense of shearing, e.g. a CE inclined against the shear flow has a map-view inclination of >90\u00b0, where the inclination angle is measured anticlockwise from the overall glacier flow direction. Quantitative comparison of digital elevation models in mid-July and mid-September 2020 revealed that the ablation in this strip is almost constant and about 5\u00a0m per two summer months. However, due to the nature of the flow field within the ablation area of a glacier (Hooke, 2019), flanking structures exposed at the down-glacier end of the mapped area must have formed at greater depth in the glacier than the structures exposed at the up-glacier end.\nThe CEs are up to a few metres long (average length 3.6\u00a0m; standard deviation 1.8\u00a0m) and are interpreted as open or closed fractures (e.g., moulins, crevasses, crevasse traces, veins) that rotate into the flow direction and consequently accommodate anti- and synthetic offset of the sub-vertical foliation, which serves as an excellent passive marker since the CEs\u2019 rotation axis is sub-vertical. The majority of isolated flanking structures can be classified as reverse drag a-type, normal drag s-type or reverse drag s-type flanking folds (Grasemann et al., 2003; Wiesmayr and Grasemann, 2005). Many of the observed flanking structures develop along mechanically interacting sets of CEs, resulting in complex and harder to interpret structures (Exner et al., 2006); these more complex structures are not described here.\nOne well-exposed example of a reverse drag a-type flanking fold, as seen when standing on the glacier, is shown in Fig. 4\na. The CE dips steeply towards the NNW and the fold axes (of both, the up- and down-glacier flanking fold) plunge steeply towards the NNW. The \u03c0-axes (poles to the best-fit \u03c0-circles, fitted to poles of foliation) are consistent with the measured fold axes, supporting the field observation that the flanking folds are close-to cylindrical. Orientation data for all flanking structures measured in the field are shown in Fig. 4b, illustrating that the orientation of the CEs varies significantly, but systematically as discussed in Section 6.\nA selection of representative flanking structures is shown in Fig. 5\n. The majority of the flanking structures\u2019 CEs are strongly localized shear zones, which developed on precursor discontinuities such as crevasses or veins. The shear zones have a thickness of 1\u20135\u00a0cm and frequently exhibit a new internal foliation. Macroscopically, the ice in the shear zones (CEs) appears to be less translucent and has a smaller grainsize than in the surrounding ice. Although initial layering generated by syntaxial vein growth or snow infill could have existed in the precursor discontinuities, fracture closure and antithetic shearing that commences once a CE has rotated through the orientation of maximum instantaneous shear strain rate (see Section 4) would have dismembered these earlier fabrics. Occasionally, flanking structures develop around presumably initially sub-circular moulins, which developed into elliptical-shaped open CEs (Fig. 5a).\nThe most frequently observed flanking structures are a-type flanking folds with an antithetic offset of <2\u00a0m, a neutral roll (single curvature) and a bulge of the central marker line of 45\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0\u03ba\u00a0<\u00a0140\u00b0 (Fig. 5b\u2013d). The angle between the flow direction and the CEs is typically 30\u00b0 < \u03c6\u00a0<\u00a080\u00b0, with the general trend that structures with lower \u03c6 exhibit less offset and have a more pronounced bulge. Out of the 159 mapped flanking structures (Figs. 2 and 3), only three are inclined against the shear flow. Normal and reverse drag s-type flanking folds exhibit synthetic offset of <1\u00a0m, over-roll and bulge angles of 50\u00b0 < \u03ba\u00a0<\u00a0140\u00b0 (Fig. 5e\u2013h). The angle between the flow direction and the CE is 20\u00b0 < \u03c6\u00a0<\u00a060\u00b0. Many structures show a pronounced change of drag along the CE, with reverse drag around one tip and normal drag around the other tip (Fig. 5g and h). Correspondingly, the bulge of the normal drag increases from the centre to the tip of the CE. In case of the example shown in Fig. 5g, the bulge increases from \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a045\u00b0 to \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a0135\u00b0. Interestingly, s-type flanking folds with \u03c6\u00a0<\u00a020\u00b0 are not present. A thorough orientation analysis of the CEs is provided in Section 6, which is however preceded by theoretical considerations and numerical modelling of the development of transtensional flanking structures (Section 4 and 5, respectively).\n\n\n3.5\nInterim summary\nThe mapped area of the Pasterze glacier exhibits a morphology, flow field, and structure that are consistent with a near-surface transtensional flow regime, an interpretation that is supported by the following observations: (i) The glacier's velocity decreases downstream, as expected for an ablation area (the maximum velocity occurs just below the equilibrium line in valley glaciers; Hooke, 2019). However, in the case of the mapped area, the velocity additionally decreases due to both a decrease of the glacier bed's slope and to significant valley widening, i.e. the Pasterze widens from a width of 300\u00a0mto 700\u00a0m over a length of about 1.4 km (Fig. 2). As will be shown in Section 7.1, a widening channel flow leads to transtension. (ii) The splaying crevasses form at an angle of <45\u00b0 at the margin between the central and the much slower flowing right flow unit. They also curve towards the glacier's centreline to become longitudinal crevasses (Fig. 3a). If these crevasses nucleate parallel to the greatest compressive stress orientation (a likely scenario), then their geometry is consistent with longitudinal compression, as first postulated by Nye (1952).\nImportantly, the flanking structures (Fig. 5) exhibit geometries and orientations that are also consistent with transtensional flow, as demonstrated by a theoretical treatment on their instantaneous and finite deformation (Section 4 and 5, respectively).\n\n\n\n4\nTranspressional vs. transtensional flow fields\nProgressive isochoric two-dimensional sub-simple shearing, loosely referred to in the present study as transpression\/transtension if lengthening\/shortening occurs parallel to the shear zone boundary, can be described with the following particle path equation (Ramberg, 1975)\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n]\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nexp\n\n(\n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\/\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\n\n)\n\nsinh\n\n(\n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nexp\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n[\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\n]\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\n\n is the elongation rate parallel to the shear zone boundary, \n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\n a shearing rate and \n\nt\n\n the time; \n\n(\nX\n,\n\nY\n)\n\n and \n\n(\nx\n,\n\ny\n)\n\n are the coordinates of a particle (components of position vectors) in the initial and deformed state, respectively. The ratio of shearing to elongation rate is related to the kinematic vorticity \n\n\nW\nk\n\n=\ncos\n\n\u03b1\n\n (Bobyarchick, 1986)\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\/\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\n=\n\u2212\n2\n\ncot\n\n\u03b1\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b1\n\n is the angle between the flow eigenvectors. Finite deformation resulting from progressive sub-simple shearing can be described, for a given finite stretch \n\nS\n\n parallel to the shear zone boundary, with the following position gradient tensor \n\nF\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n]\n\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\u2212\ncot\n\n\u03b1\n\n(\n\nS\n\u2212\n\nS\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nS\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n[\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\n]\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinite deformation of a unit square for dextral transpression and transtension are shown, for a shear zone parallel stretch \n\nS\n=\n1.2\n\n and its reciprocal, respectively, in Fig. 6\n. The component \n\n\nF\n12\n\n\n of the position gradient tensor is 0.5 in both cases. The angle \n\n\u03b1\n=\n\u2212\n\ncot\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n[\n\n0.5\n\/\n\n(\n\nS\n\u2212\n\nS\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n is hence negative\/positive for transpression\/transtension (\n\n\u03b1\n=\n\u2213\n36.3\n\u00b0\n\n), whereas the kinematic vorticity is positive in both cases (\n\n\nW\nk\n\n=\n0.81\n\n).\nThe angle \n\n\u03b1\n\n can be constructed by means of a Mohr circle of the second kind (Simpson and De Paor, 1993). The circle is constructed by drawing a chord from the corner \n\n\n(\n\n\nF\n12\n\n,\n\nF\n22\n\n\n)\n\n\n to the point \n\n\n(\n\n\nF\n21\n\n,\n\nF\n11\n\n\n)\n\n\n, where \n\n\nF\n21\n\n=\n0\n\n in the present example; the length and midpoint of that chord is the circle's diameter and position, respectively (Fig. 6). In physical space, the angle between the chord and any shear zone parallel line (e.g., \n\ny\n=\n\nF\n22\n\n\n) is the angle \n\n\u03b1\n\n, whereas in Mohr space, the central angle of the minor circular sector between points \n\n\n(\n\n0\n,\n\nF\n11\n\n\n)\n\n\n and \n\n\n(\n\n0\n,\n\nF\n22\n\n\n)\n\n\n is the double angle \n\n2\n\u03b1\n\n. Although this Mohr circle construction provides a link with physical space (via the corner of a deformed unit square) and yields the correct angular relations (double angles), determining orientations via the pole method requires the construction of another circle by mirroring the existing circle across the ordinate (i.e., a Mohr circle of the first kind is constructed; De Paor and Means, 1984). The pole of this mirror image circle is \n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n\nF\n12\n\n,\n\nF\n11\n\n\n)\n\n\n; chords emanating from this pole to any point on the mirror image circle provide the correct orientations in physical space. For clarity, the flow characteristic orientations, which are fixed for a given constant flow type with respect to the shear zone boundary, are shown in physical space as circular plots (Fig. 6). Additionally, the instantaneous sense of slip, direction of rotation and elongation of a hypothetical planar slip-surface, e.g. a CE in the present context, are shown.\nThe circular plots illustrate that six fields (labelled with roman capital numerals \u2013II to IV) with different instantaneous behaviour of a CE can be discriminated. The eigenvectors \na\n\n\n1\n and \na\n\n\n2\n separate fields in which the CE is either co- or counter-rotating towards a stable orientation that is parallel to the divergent flow apophysis (Fossen et al., 1994), here simply referred to as \u2018fabric attractor\u2019 (Passchier 1997). Note that the terms co- and counter-rotating are used with respect to the overall sense of imposed shear, e.g. a co-rotating line rotates clockwise under dextral (clockwise) shear, and shall not be confused with clockwise and counter-clockwise (which depends on the view point). The two mutually orthogonal instantaneous stretching axes, ISA\n1 and ISA\n2, divide all possible orientations of the CE into two sectors with syn- and antithetic kinematics. The two mutually orthogonal maximum shearing orientations \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n1\n\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n2\n\n\n are at 45\u00b0 to the ISA\n1 and ISA\n2 orientations and separate fields in which the CE is either lengthening or shortening. Co-rotating (indicated by yellowish fields in Fig. 6) CEs can either experience synthetic slip\/shortening (+I), antithetic slip\/shortening (+II), antithetic slip\/lengthening (+III), or synthetic slip\/lengthening (+IV). Counter-rotating (indicated by blueish fields) CEs can only experience synthetic slip and are either shortening (-I) or lengthening (-II). Since \n\n\nW\nk\n\n\n is identical for transpression and transtension (Fig. 6), the various flow characteristic orientations in physical space (i.e., the circular plots) under transtension are readily obtained by counter-rotating the orientations for transpression by the angle \u03b1.\nAlthough the flow characteristic orientations and the instantaneous behaviour of a CE share many similarities in transpression and transtension, a fundamental difference is evident. The first flow eigenvector \na\n\n\n1\n is parallel to the shear zone boundary in both cases, but its eigenvalue is positive (lengthening) under transpression and negative (shortening) under transtension (note blue line at the base of the deformed unit square in Fig. 6). However, under isochoric two-dimensional sub-simple shearing, the eigenvector with a positive (lengthening) value is the fabric attractor (see also streamlines in Fig. 6). Consequently, the fabric attractor is under transtension not parallel to the shear zone boundary, a detail that has important implications for the progressive development of flanking structures.\nDuring progressive deformation, a CE can rotate through the different fields depicted in Fig. 6 and hence its kinematics can change, for example, from syn-to antithetic and back to synthetic (Grasemann et al., 2019). Under transpression, the CE either co- or counter-rotates into the orientation of the shear zone-parallel fabric attractor, leading after large strain to s-type flanking folds or shear bands (Wiesmayr and Grasemann, 2005). In both cases, both the deflected marker lines and the CE become, after some shear strain, parallel to the shear zone boundary and the structures are dismembered (Grasemann et al., 2019). Under transtension, however, the fabric attractor is oblique to the shear zone boundary and, as shown by the numerical models described in Section 5, the CE co- or counter-rotates into this orientation, accumulating the synthetically offset marker lines at the CE's tips. Large strain always results in the formation of s-type flanking folds and shear bands are unstable. Under both transpression and transtension, a-type flanking folds are transient structures. The dominant presence of s-type flanking folds and the absence of shear bands may hence be indicative for high-strain transtensional shear zones.\nIt is important to note that the above account on the theoretical development and geometry of flanking structures assumes an initial planar fabric that is parallel to the shear zone boundary, which is parallel to the x-direction, or, the first flow eigenvector \na\n\n\n1\n (Fig. 6). If the initial planar fabric would be parallel to the fabric attractor under transtension, i.e. inclined by the angle \u03b1, then the resulting structures would be identical to those formed under transpression, since the flow invariants (and hence Mohr circle positions and radii) are identical.\n\n\n5\nNumerical modelling of transtensional flanking structures\n\n5.1\nNumerical models\nThe finite deformation resulting from progressive transtension around a CE that deforms homogeneously by stretching, rotation and shearing was modelled using an Eshelby solution, modified for viscous fluid modelling (Exner and Dabrowski, 2010); implementation details are provided in Appendix C. A series of models was run for a homogeneous transtensional background flow with five different kinematic vorticities W\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a0{0.87, 0.77, 0.71, 0.64, 0.5}, corresponding to \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0{30\u00b0, 40\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 60\u00b0}, and three different initial CE orientations \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a0{50\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 130\u00b0}, where the angle \u03c6\n0 is measured counter-clockwise from the first flow eigenvector \na\n\n\n1\n, as defined in Fig. 6 (the CE with \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a0130\u00b0, for example, is initially inclined against the overall shear flow). Model results are shown for an initial planar fabric that is parallel to \na\n\n\n1\n and a finite effective shear strain \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a02 in Fig. 7\n. Interestingly, the final geometry is not very sensitive to the W\n\nk\n of the imposed deformation, but strongly dependent on \u03c6\n0. However, the reader should bear in mind that geometrical differences for a given W\n\nk\n arise from the choice of both the CE and the initial fabric orientation relative to the fabric attractor of the imposed deformation. In the following, the terms \u2018overall shear\u2019 or \u2018shear flow\u2019 refer to the shearing parallel to the initial fabric.\nIn the \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a050\u00b0 models (first column in Fig. 7), the CE is initially inclined into the overall shear and its initial orientation is already close to the fabric attractor, which is under transtension parallel to the second flow eigenvector \na\n\n\n2\n (Fig. 6). In the \u03b1\u00a0<\u00a050\u00b0 models, the CE rotates into the shear flow, in the \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a050\u00b0 model the CE is initially already in a stable position (and hence only lengthens and accumulates displacement without rotating), and in the \u03b1\u00a0>\u00a050\u00b0 model the CE rotates against the overall shear. Nevertheless, despite this different rotational behaviour of the CE, the finite flanking structure of these five models is very similar, even though the stable orientation of the CE varies: The central marker layer has a neutral roll and a negative bulge in the range \u221240\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0\u03ba\u00a0<\u00a0\u221220\u00b0. The strong reverse drag of the marker lines is compensated by folds developing at the CE's tips. The structures of the \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a050\u00b0 models can hence be classified as reverse drag s-type flanking folds.\nIn the \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 models (second column in Fig. 7), the CE is initially normal to the overall shear and experiences instantaneous lengthening and rotation into the shear flow. Initially the sense of slip on the CE is antithetic, but reverses to synthetic once the CE has rotated through the orientation of the maximum instantaneous stretching axis (ISA\n1; as illustrated in Fig. 6). Thus, an initial a-type flanking fold develops into a s-type structure. In all models, the central marker layer exhibits an over-roll, a normal drag and a minor bulge in the range 25\u00b0 < \u03ba\u00a0<\u00a035\u00b0. Clearly, in the higher kinematic vorticity models, the CE has not yet reached a stable orientation (parallelism with the fabric attractor). In the \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0 model, the angle between the CE and fabric attractor is ca. 13\u00b0, whereas in the \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a060\u00b0 model, it is ca. 5\u00b0. Nevertheless, more deformation would simply result in further rotation of the CE into the attractor and accumulation of additional synthetic displacement.\nIn the \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a0130\u00b0 models (third column in Fig. 7), the CE is initially inclined against the shear flow and in all models the CE has not yet reached a stable position (in fact, the CEs are sub-parallel to the orientation of ISA\n1). The CEs experience instantaneous shortening followed by instantaneous lengthening while rotating into the shear flow. The central marker layer exhibits antithetic shear with an extensional offset, reverse drag and a bulge of \u03ba\u00a0\u2248\u00a090\u00b0. The reversely dragged marker layers in the centre of the flanking structure exhibit a neutral roll, thin towards the CE and only in close vicinity of the CE's tips is the reverse drag compensated by normal drag. The structures of the \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a0130\u00b0 models could be classified as a-type flanking folds, but note that further deformation of the CE and rotation towards the fabric attractor would occur in the field of synthetic slip, subsequently transforming the structure into an s-type flanking fold.\n\n\n5.2\nComparison with natural flanking structures\nThe natural flanking structures (Fig. 5) share many similarities with the modelled structures (Fig. 7) and exhibit features that are in fact diagnostic for transtension: (1) Although the natural and modelled a-type flanking folds (Fig. 5a\u2013d and third column in Fig. 7, respectively) are similar to previously modelled and natural structures that formed under transpression (e.g. Grasemann et al., 2003; Kocher and Mancktelow, 2005), transpressional shear zones frequently also include shear bands (Wiesmayr and Grasemann, 2005). However, the mapped area of the Pasterze glacier does not contain a single shear band, suggesting that shear bands are not stable in transtension. In summary, a-type flanking folds can form both in transpression and transtension and are hence not diagnostic features, but the co-existence of a-type flanking folds with shear bands is diagnostic for transpression. (2) Under transpression, s-type flanking structures can only form around CEs which are inclined into the overall shear flow with an angle of \u03c6\u00a0<\u00a045\u00b0. In contrast, under transtension, s-type flanking fold can form around CEs with inclinations \u03c6\u00a0>\u00a045\u00b0 (see for example models with \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a050\u00b0 or \u03c6\n0\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 and W\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a00.5 in Fig. 7 and natural example in Fig. 5e). (3) Flanking structures forming under transtension with an initial CE orientation \u03c6\n0 that lies between ISA\n1 and the first flow eigenvector \na\n\n\n1\n (sectors \u2013II, \u2013I and +IV in Fig. 6) exhibit reverse drag of the central marker line (first column in Fig. 7). This pronounced reverse drag transitions into normal drag towards the CE's tips, forming folds (Fig. 5g and h) that accommodate the displacement on the CE. Once in a stable orientation, the CE continues accumulating displacement ad infinitum, although eventually the structure will fade into a new foliation, parallel to the fabric attractor. Such an s-type flanking fold, with central reverse drag that transitions towards the tips into normal drag and folding, is not observed forming under transpression (e.g., Grasemann et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n6\nAnalysis and interpretation of orientation data\nIn this section the orientations of the CE traces, as interpreted on the drone map (red lines in Figs. 2 and 3), are analysed. The CEs (N\u00a0=\u00a0159), with their lengths exaggerated by a factor five, and the glacier's annual mean velocities are plotted in Fig. 8\na. Close inspection of that map reveals that the CEs are, in map view, inclined into the overall shear and that their orientation relative to the flow direction (\u03c6) exhibits a systematic spatial variation. Specifically, \u03c6 increases from the SW to the NE, from the right margin of the left flow unit towards the glacier's centreline, where in the present context \u2018centreline\u2019 refers to the centre of the left flow unit where the flow velocity magnitude is maximum as indicated by the pattern of the s\n2 foliation and not to the geographic centre of the glacier. A reference line was objectively chosen by letting the line pass through the mean position of all CEs and systematically varying its orientation until the maximum correlation coefficient between \u03c6 (angle between CE and reference line, measured counter-clockwise from the down-glacier direction; see inset in Fig. 8a) and the reference line's normal direction is attained (this optimised correlation is plotted in Fig. 8c). This optimised reference line is in fact sub-parallel to the average flow directions (Fig. 8a).\nThe CE inclinations (\u03c6) are plotted vs. down-glacier distance (x) in Fig. 8b. Out of the 159 interpreted CEs, only three are inclined against the flow direction (\u03c6\u00a0>\u00a090\u00b0); these are excluded in later analysis since they cannot have reached a stable orientation within a transtensional background flow. One isolated CE close to the study area's lower end is also excluded. The variability of the CE inclinations clearly decreases down-glacier, but there is no (significant) correlation between inclination and down-glacier distance. Nevertheless, when the CE inclinations SW and NE of the reference line are plotted separately (white and black circle in Fig. 8b, respectively), it is clear that the former have lower inclinations (arithmetic mean \n\n\n\u03c6\n\u203e\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a047\u00b0) than the latter (\n\n\n\u03c6\n\u203e\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a065\u00b0).\nThe CE inclinations (\u03c6) vs. distance to the reference line (y) are plotted in Fig. 8c, together with the best-fit linear regression model (the function \u03c6(y) is given), the 95% confidence belt around the data and the regression. Even though the correlation is highly significant (p-value\u00a0=\u00a07.72\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221218), the data display some scatter, which is attributed to two potential sources: (1) Many CEs are interacting with each other, leading to complex structures that, as stated earlier, are not discussed here. Mechanical interaction can lead to orientations that are not parallel to the fabric attractor (Exner et al., 2006). (2) Some CEs may not have reached a stable orientation, in particular those located in the upper reaches of the zone (Fig. 8b). Nevertheless, in the subsequent analysis it is assumed that, on average, the CEs have reached a stable orientation, an assumption that is not far-fetched as discussed in Section 7.2.\nIf one assumes that the best-fit linear relation of \u03c6 vs. normal distance y provides the angle between the flow direction and the fabric attractor (\u03b1) it is possible to determine the vorticity (\n\n\nW\nk\n\n=\ncos\n\n\u03b1\n\n) and the inclination of greatest shortening rate (ISA\n2), which can be easily derived, either from the Mohr circle or from the circular plot shown in Fig. 6, i.e. \n\n\u03b2\n=\n\n(\n\n\u03b1\n+\n270\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n\/\n2\n\n. These relations are plotted in Fig. 8d within their theoretical bounds, i.e. from simple shear (W\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a01) to pure shear (W\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a00).\nThe (linear) function \u03b2(y) should, in theory, provide an upper bound for the angle \u03b4, measured between crevasses and the reference line (again, measured counter-clockwise from the flow direction), if one assumes that crevasses nucleate parallel to ISA\n2, a likely scenario for the splaying crevasses. An upper bound is expected because once formed, the crevasses commence to co-rotate, i.e. their inclination \u03b4 will decrease during subsequent deformation. The map view inclinations of all traced crevasses are plotted vs. normal distance to reference line in Fig. 8e, together with the aforementioned theoretical upper-bound, which yields a good estimate for the maximum crevasse inclination. The normal distance from the reference line where pure shear conditions are expected (\u03b4\u00a0=\u00a0180\u00b0) is also indicated in Fig. 8e (vertical dash-dotted line). A line drawn in map view which is parallel to the reference line and at this \u2018pure shear conditions\u2019 distance (dash-dotted line in Fig. 8f) is consistent with the approximate region where the splaying crevasses become longitudinal crevasses.\nThe aforementioned analysis is effectively one-dimensional since all orientations are analysed normal to the reference line irrespective of their down-glacier distance. Nevertheless, it is tempting to construct two-dimensional trajectories to illustrate how well the estimate of the ISA\n2 orientation from the (assumed to be stable) CE orientations fits the map view geometry of the splaying crevasses. Since the inclination of ISA\n2 is given by a linear function of the form \n\n\u03b4\n=\np\ny\n+\nq\n\n, the trace of a trajectory is readily obtained by integration\n\n(4)\n\n\nx\n\n(\ny\n)\n\n=\n\u222b\n\ncot\n\n(\n\np\ny\n+\nq\n\n)\n\nd\ny\n=\n\n\nln\n\n[\n\nsin\n\n(\n\np\ny\n+\nq\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\np\n\n+\nC\n\n\n\nwhere C is the integration constant (e.g., when \n\nC\n=\n\n\n\n\nln\n\n[\n\nsin\n\n(\nq\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\/\np\n\n the trajectory passes through the origin). Trajectories for both \na\n\n\n1\n and ISA\n2 are plotted in the local x-y-coordinate system in the inset in Fig. 8d. An ISA\n2 trajectory, rotated to the global coordinate system, is also plotted onto a map of all crevasses in Fig. 8f, illustrating that the estimated upper bound for the crevasse orientations matches the splaying crevasses' geometry.\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nOrigin of transtension\nAs already summarised in Section 3.5, the glacier's morphology and its structural assemblage in the mapped area are consistent with a \u2018compressive flow\u2019 (Nye, 1952). This term is entrenched in the literature, although \u2018decelerating flow\u2019, and its counterpart \u2018accelerating flow\u2019, may be more descriptive. For a glacier in a gently undulating, parallel-sided valley, the conditions for the occurrence of longitudinal compression are (Nye, 1952):\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nd\nq\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n+\n\nq\nR\n\ncot\n\n\u03b1\n<\n0\n,\n\n\n\nwhere x is the down-glacier direction, q is the discharge, i.e. volume passing through any cross-section in unit time, R is the radius of curvature of the bed and \u03b1 is here the slope of the glacier's surface. For a uniformly sloping glacier bed (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u221e), compressive flow is hence expected in the ablation area (dq\/dx\u00a0<\u00a00). In the absence of accumulation or ablation (dq\/dx\u00a0=\u00a00), a concave-up bed (R\u00a0<\u00a01) will lead to compression; additionally, down-glacier valley widening could lead to compression (it is enigmatic why Nye (1952), on p. 91, states the opposite). In the mapped area, all three factors are present, (i) ablation, (ii) shallowing of the glacier bed and (iii) valley widening. The theoretical velocity distribution and the slip-line field in a longitudinal section of an ideal valley glaciers on an undulating bed (Nye, 1951) and the theoretical crevasse patterns within an \u2018extending\u2019 and \u2018compressive\u2019 flow in a parallel-sided valley (Nye, 1952) are amongst the best-known diagrams in glaciology and shall hence not be further discussed here. However, even though Nye's model is consistent with the observed splaying crevasse geometries, it is inconsistent with the progressive transtensional deformation recorded by the flanking structures, which requires transverse extension that is not possible in a parallel-sided valley.\nNevertheless, valley widening also leads to a compressive flow and in fact transtension; this case is discussed here for a glacier of constant unit discharge and unit thickness (plane strain). Although solutions exist for diverging or converging channel flow (so-called Jeffery-Hamel flow), an analytical treatment is beyond the scope of the present study. Thus, a kinematic model that qualitatively encompasses the superficial velocity distribution of a glacier shall suffice (see Appendix D for details). The chosen velocity field (Fig. 9\na) is a superposition of a uniform distribution, which accounts for slip at the channel margin, and a quadratic (parabolic) flow profile, with a maximum velocity in the channel centre, mimicking the typical superficial velocity field of valley glaciers. The velocity gradients for such a radial velocity field are readily obtained, permitting visualising, for example, the trajectories of the flow eigenvectors (\na\n\n\n1\n and \na\n\n\n2\n) and of the greatest instantaneous shortening axis (ISA\n2), where the latter indeed resemble the traces of splaying crevasses (Fig. 9b). It is interesting to note that in this model the angle between ISA\n2 and the margin is 45\u00b0 in the absence of slip, whereas the angle decreases with increasing flow velocity at the boundary (relative to the central velocity). Finite strain ellipses show that the shear strain systematically increases from the centre to the margins and that pure shear is only present in the channel centre (Fig. 9c). Obviously, during progressive deformation the long axes of the strain ellipses become parallel to the fabric attractor (\na\n\n\n2\n for transtension). Both the flow characteristic orientations (Fig. 9b) and the finite strain distribution (Fig. 9c) are of course due to systematic variations of the kinematic vorticity, which increases from the channel centre (W\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a00) towards the margins (Fig. 9d), where simple shear (W\n\nk\n\u00a0=\u00a01) is only attained in the absence of slip. Even though this model is two-dimensional and lacks any mechanics, it is qualitatively consistent with the observed structures and the transverse variations of kinematic vorticity (Fig. 8).\n\n\n7.2\nOrigin of flanking structures\nAs described in Section 3.4, the vast majority of flanking structures form around closed fractures or veins. In contrast to typical crevasse, or fracture, traces, which comprise layers of coarse clear ice (\u2018blue bands\u2019; see section 5.2.2. in Jennings and Hambrey, 2021, and references therein), the ice within the CEs is less translucent and has a smaller grainsize than in the surrounding ice and frequently exhibits a new foliation. These newly formed fabrics are consistent with slip on the CEs. Rarely, flanking structures form around small-scale moulins (Fig. 5a).\nThe mapped flanking structures are exposed within a relatively narrow zone along the right margin of the left flow unit (Fig. 2). Both their density and orientation variability decrease down-glacier (Fig. 8b). The absence of (mappable) flanking structures further NE most likely reflects that the rotation axis of initially sub-vertical crevasses is sub-horizontal in the left flow unit's central area, leading to flanking structures, if they do form, with sub-horizontal fold axes. Such flanking structures were indeed exposed on the fracture walls of longitudinal crevasses close to the Pasterze's terminus in the summer of 2016 (Fig. 10\n). Clearly, if similar flanking structures would be present further up-glacier, they would, in map view, fade into the foliation. The rare occurrence of flanking structures along the left margin on the other hand is probably due to low fracture density.\nThe high density and orientation variability of the CEs in the upper reaches of the zone reflects that CEs, or future CEs, are actively forming there and also up-glacier. Further down-glacier, the CEs orientation variability decreases and, as argued in Section 6, the majority of CEs have rotated into a stable orientation. However, it is doubtful that all CEs have originated in the upper reaches of the mapped area, since even stably orientated CEs continue to accommodate slip, which eventually leads to dismembering of the structure.\nIt is straightforward to estimate the rotation rate of a CE by assuming that it behaves like a passive marker line under a plane-strain homogenous transtensional background flow, as defined by Eq. (1). A constant rate of shear zone parallel shortening \n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\n\n leads, after a time t, to a shear zone parallel stretch \n\nS\n=\nexp\n\n(\n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n. The components of a unit position vector at time \n\nt\n=\n0\n\n are \n\nX\n=\ncos\n\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n and \n\nY\n=\nsin\n\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n. Substitution of these initial positions into Eq. (3) gives the finite position for any given value of stretch, or time, so that the orientation of the line is given by:\n\n(6)\n\n\ntan\n\n\u03c6\n=\n\n\nsin\n\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\nS\n2\n\n\u2212\nsin\n\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\ncot\n\n\u03b1\n\n(\n\n\nS\n2\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one assumes that the CEs are fractures that form parallel to the greatest instantaneous shortening axis (ISA\n2), i.e. \n\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\u03b1\n+\n270\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n\/\n2\n\n, their orientation as a function of time can be determined. Curves of \n\n\u03c6\n\n vs. time are shown in Fig. 11\n for a range of values of \u03b1 and for a shortening rate \n\n\ne\n\u02d9\n\n=\n\u2212\n15\n\u00d7\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n10\n\n\n\n s\u22121, a value taken from the upper reaches of the study area (see Fig. 2). These curves illustrate that CEs originating from fractures that formed parallel to the greatest shortening orientation have reached orientations of \n\n\u03c6\n<\n90\n\u00b0\n\n after 7 (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0) to 21 years (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a060\u00b0). Typical flow velocities in the upper reaches of the study area are ca. 10 m\/a, so that orientations of \n\n\u03c6\n<\n90\n\u00b0\n\n are expected to develop after a down-glacier translation of 70\u2013210\u00a0m. Theoretically, truly stable orientations are of course only achieved asymptotically as time goes to infinity. Hence curves on the plot (Fig. 11) indicate when the orientations are \n\n\u03c6\n\u2264\n\u03b1\n+\n10\n\u00b0\n\n and \n\n\u03c6\n\u2264\n\u03b1\n+\n5\n\u00b0\n\n, where the time range for the former \u2018close-to-stable\u2019 orientation is 20 (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a030\u00b0) to 32 years (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a060\u00b0). Even though this simple analysis assumes a constant rate of shortening parallel to the flow direction and a constant vorticity, it illustrates that CEs forming up-glacier of or within the upper reaches of the study area will reach close-to-stable orientations after a few hundred metres of down-glacier translation. This crude estimate is consistent with the CE orientation vs. down-glacier distance plot (Fig. 8b), which shows that (i) unstable orientations (\n\n\u03c6\n>\n90\n\u00b0\n\n) only occur within the first 100\u00a0m and (ii) the range of orientations systematically decreases within the first 300\u2013400\u00a0m of the flanking structure zone.\n\n\n7.3\nTranstensional vs. transpressional flanking structures in rocks\nPlane strain transtension, as used throughout this paper, implies shortening parallel to the shear zone boundary (the \u2018tension\u2019 refers to the extension normal to the shear zone boundary). In the Earth's upper crust, transtension is expected to occur, for example, in fold and thrust belts, with shortening parallel to and extension (thickening) normal to a basal detachment. To date, the only and most convincing example of a transtensional s-type flanking fold from a fold-and-thrust belt (Tethyan Himalaya in Spiti, India) was described by Wiesmayr and Grasemann (2005) and is shown here again and compared with results of numerical modelling in Fig. 12\na and b, respectively. The diagnostic features for transtension are as follows: (i) Reverse drag of the central marker line that passes into normal drag towards the CE's tips. (ii) Relatively large displacement of the central marker layer together with a pronounced displacement gradient towards the tips. (iii) Relatively large angle (37\u00b0 in the example shown in Fig. 12a) of the CE with the passive markers, i.e. layering not affected by folding. Note that some s-type flanking folds in the Pasterze (Fig. 5g and h) exhibit the same features.\nThe geometrical differences between transpressional and transtensional s-type flanking folds are elucidated by an example from an oblique-slip normal shear zone in the Eastern Alps, which is kinematically constrained by co-existing a-type flanking folds and shear bands (S\u00f6lva et al., 2005), where the latter cannot form in transtension (Section 4). This transpressional s-type flanking fold (Fig. 12c and d) exhibits the following characteristics: (i) Normal drag of the central maker line that passes into reverse drag towards the CE's tips. (ii) A pronounced hook-shaped central marker line. (iii) Relatively small angle (16\u00b0 in the example shown in Fig. 12c) of the CE with the shear zone boundary. The geometry of this transpressional flanking structure can be explained by the following progressive development, as suggested by numerical models of Grasemann et al. (2019): Initially antithetic shear along the CE formed an a-type flanking fold, but as the CE rotated, the central marker's offset eventually switched from anti-to synthetic. This development results in reverse drag and markers with a prominent hook-shape (Hudleston, 1989) or over-roll (Coelho et al., 2005) of the central marker line.\n\n\n7.4\nTranstensional vs. transpressional ductile shear zones\nTranspression\/transtension kinematics is a direct consequence of the rotational character of plate tectonics (Harland, 1971; Dewey et al., 1998) and the theoretical fabric development under transpression\/transtension, including more complex non-plane strain types, has received much attention over the last decades (Sanderson and Marchini, 1984; Tikoff and Fossen, 1993;\nRobin and Cruden, 1994; Fossen and Tikoff, 1998). However, the ubiquity of shear bands and a-type flanking folds and the general lack of s-type flanking folds with geometries typical for transtension (e.g., Fig. 12a and b) in natural ductile shear zones raises some questions about the occurrence of transtensional shear. In fact, there are numerous examples of ductile shear zones from various tectonic settings for which quantitative strain analysis indicates transpressional flow (Talbot and Sokoutis, 1995; Tikoff and Green, 1997; Grasemann et al., 1999; Lin and Jiang, 2001; Czeck and Hudleston, 2003; Xypolias et al., 2003, 2018; Sengupta and Ghosh, 2004; Goscombe et al., 2005; Passchier et al., 2007; Sullivan and Law, 2007; Sarkarinejad et al., 2008; Gillam et al., 2013; Little et al., 2016; Carreras and Druguet, 2019). In contrast, transtensional flow in ductile shear zones is rarely deduced and typically supported by conceptual models derived from independent geological arguments (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Whitney et al., 2007; Erk\u00fcl et al., 2017). Furthermore, quantitative vorticity analyses suggest that the majority of investigated ductile shear zones record a transpressional flow (for a review see Xypolias, 2010, and references cited therein). However, transtensional deformation must occur, for example, at the large scale within releasing bends of crustal strike-slip zones (Harding, 1985; Dewey et al., 1998; Waldron, 2005) and can also be inferred at a small-scale from the initiation angle of en \u00e9chelon veins in brittle-ductile shear zones (Ramsay and Huber, 1983;\nPeacock and Sanderson, 1995). Nevertheless, even in extensional tectonic settings, there is strong evidence that shear zones along detachment systems follow a transpressional deformation path (Bailey and Eyster, 2003) and are characterized by pervasive shear band fabrics at various scales (e.g., Jolivet et al., 2010) or mechanically interact with rotating high-angle faults (Wernicke 1981; Lister et al., 1984; Gessner et al., 2001), indicating that these crustal scale extensional shear zones are stretching faults (Means, 1989).\nThe sparseness of reported transtensional ductile shear zones hence raises the question: Is transtensional flow in the Earth's crust rare or were the kinematics of certain shear zones misinterpreted? Perhaps the natural and modelled transtensional flanking structures presented in this study (ideally in conjunction with clast system analysis; Simpson and De Paor, 1993; Marques and Coelho, 2003) serve as an aid to better interpret the kinematics of natural shear zones, so that in the future this question can be answered.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nAnalysis and modelling of transtensional flanking structures exposed in an alpine valley glacier led to the following conclusions:\n\n\u2022\nThe most frequently observed flanking structures in the glacier are a-type flanking folds with an antithetic offset. The cross-cutting elements (CEs), which are typically closed crevasses, are generally inclined into the overall map-view shear flow.\n\n\n\u2022\nShear bands, which are entirely absent in the studied area, appear to be unstable under transtensional general shear. Although the absence of shear bands is not necessarily an indicator for transtension, since they can only form along CEs inclined against the overall shear, an abundance of shear bands is a diagnostic feature for transpressional general shear.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe angle between the CEs and the glacier's flow direction systematically increases in a transverse direction towards the glacier's centreline. Under the assumption that the CEs have reached, on average, a stable orientation, the kinematic vorticity and the orientation of the maximum shortening rate can be determined. Trajectories of the latter are sub-parallel to the glacier's splaying crevasses, indicating that they nucleate parallel to the greatest compressive stress orientation.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe observed flanking structure geometries, the spatial variation of CE orientations, the absence of shear bands and the geometry of the splaying crevasses are consistent with plane-strain transtensional shear, caused primarily by down-glacier valley widening.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe abundance of shear bands in natural ductile shear zones in rock indicates that transpression may be more common than transtension, but perhaps transtensional shear zones have been misinterpreted. The natural and modelled transtensional flanking structures presented in this study (ideally in conjunction with clast system analysis) hopefully serve as an aid to better interpret the kinematics of natural shear zones.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor Statement\n\nFranziska Mayrhofer: Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Visualization; Writing - original draft; Martin Sch\u00f6pfer: Conceptualization; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Supervision; Visualization; Writing - review & editing; Marta Adamuszek: Investigation; Methodology; Software; Visualization; Marcin D\u0105browski: Investigation; Methodology; Software; Bernhard Grasemann: Conceptualization; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Resources; Supervision; Visualization; Writing - review & editing;\n\n","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAlpine glaciers exhibit a wide array of flow regimes due to the complex interactions between their climatological drivers and internal dynamics. These flow regimes produce many patterns of deformation that have motivated the study of glacier structure, both as an analogue for crustal deformation (e.g. Ramberg, 1964; Hudleston, 1977; Sharp et al., 1988; Herbst and Neubauer, 2000) and as a way of better characterising the underlying dynamic controls on glacier change (e.g. Allen et al., 1960; Lawson et al., 1994; Hambrey and Glasser, 2003; Hambrey et al., 2005; Jiskoot et al., 2017; Trantow and Herzfeld, 2018; Monz et al., 2021; Jennings and Hambrey, 2021). Among the most iconic glacier structures are spectacular glacier-scale fold trains, often spanning tens of kilometres downvalley on surge-type glaciers and highlighted by medial moraines (supraglacial debris trails) inherited from upstream dendritic valley networks (e.g. Gripp, 1929; Post, 1969, 1972; Driscoll, 1980; Lawson et al., 1994; Herreid and Truffer, 2016; Glasser et al., 2022) (Fig. 1\n). These large fold trains record the flux histories of glaciers that experience surges: dramatic and transient shifts in the partitioning of ice flow between internal ductile polycrystalline ice creep (Nye, 1951; Glen, 1955; Duval et al., 2010) and frictionally-controlled sliding at the glacier bed (Kamb and LaChapelle, 1964; Kamb, 1970). Given that folds reflect the combined processes of internal deformation and basal slip (Hudleston, 2015; Jennings and Hambrey, 2021), their kinematic evolution can be used to infer glacier flow histories.\nSurge-type glaciers exhibit temporary and cyclical increases in flow speed, up to several orders of magnitude during surges, which last from several months to several years (e.g. Meier and Post, 1969; Harrison and Post, 2003) and coincide with hydraulically controlled periods of low effective pressure at the glacier bed and correspondingly reduced basal friction (Kamb et al., 1985; Kamb, 1987). While the precise mechanisms of glacier surging can vary between glaciers and regions, and involve internal thermal structure and subglacial till rheology (e.g. Clarke et al., 1984; Truffer et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2003; Benn et al., 2019; Th\u00f8gersen et al., 2019; Terleth et al., 2021), the underlying causes are less well understood. Statistical analyses of surge-type glaciers have identified multiple (often overlapping) elements intrinsic and extrinsic to the glaciers themselves that correlate with surge propensity, including valley and glacier geometry (Clarke et al., 1986; Hamilton and Dowdeswell, 1996), regional climate (Sevestre and Benn, 2015), and characteristics of the bed such as lithology (Jiskoot et al., 2003; Crompton and Flowers, 2016), geologic age (Jiskoot et al., 2000, 2003), and fracture density (Crompton et al., 2018). Because the global population of alpine glaciers spans these geometric, geologic, and environmental parameter ranges (Sevestre and Benn, 2015), surge-type glaciers are a useful natural laboratory in which to study the many cryospheric interactions governing the dynamics of fast and irregular flow. However, the difficulty in accessing the glacier bed (e.g. Bj\u00f6rnsson, 1998; Iverson et al., 2007; Rada and Schoof, 2018) is a primary challenge to studying basal processes, motivating the development of surface-based proxies for basal processes important to the surge cycle.\nFolds are commonly used to interpret the deformation histories of rocks (Hudleston and Treagus, 2010), where synkinematic observation is virtually impossible, unless simulated with analog or numerical models (e.g. Biot et al., 1961; Mancktelow and Abbassi, 1992; Mancktelow, 1999; Schmalholz, 2006). Folds in lower- to mid-crustal shear zones, a tectonic setting broadly seen as an analogue to ice flow in glaciers (e.g. Lawson et al., 1994; Herbst and Neubauer, 2000), have been used to characterise their kinematic evolution from the microscopic to the regional scale. Fold geometry in shear zones is often used to determine the sense of shear (e.g. Simpson and Schmid, 1983; Grasemann and St\u00fcwe, 2001), and can be applied to examine the activity of variability in strain rate (e.g. Melosh et al., 2018), and the influence of mechanical instabilities (e.g. Ghosh and Sengupta, 1987; Carreras et al., 2005). In surge-type glaciers large-scale folding is primarily passive (Hudleston, 2015). Similar structures (albeit at different scales) exist in environments where the flow field is characterized by differential mass transport, such as along the margins of shear zones (e.g. Coward and Potts, 1983; Alsop and Holdsworth, 2007) and associated with pre-existing planar elements within them (e.g. Escher et al., 1975; Simpson and Sistach, 1982), within unconsolidated sediments (e.g. Alsop and Marco, 2014), and within glacial till (e.g. Sardeson, 1906; Shaw, 1977; Evans et al., 2006). In the glaciological context, some studies have described the progression of dynamic processes during entire surge cycles (e.g. Clarke et al., 1984; Murray and Porter, 2001; Flowers et al., 2011; Jay-Allemand et al., 2011), but the spatial and temporal limitations on data acquisition, especially going back several decades, result in a relative paucity of observations spanning multiple surge cycles. Recent work has aimed to address this gap using numerical ice-flow modelling to approximate the folding in a small surge-type glacier across a range of basal conditions (Clarke and Hambrey, 2019) and evaluate results with field observations of fold geometry following a surge event (Hambrey and Clarke, 2019). While some studies have characterised different types of folding in glacial ice (e.g. Sharp, 1958; Hambrey, 1977; Hudleston, 1977; Jennings et al., 2014), none have completely accounted for the three-dimensional non-cylindrical complexity of folding that reflects the polyphase deformation histories of surge-type glaciers. Previous numerical modelling of synthetic folds (e.g. Schmalholz, 2008; Welker et al., 2019) points to the usefulness of model-driven characterisation of three-dimensional fold kinematics. We aim to explore its use in a glaciological setting.\nIn this study, we model the kinematic evolution of folds through multiple surge cycles within a set of idealized glacier confluence configurations, and identify how differences in glacier flow regimes imprint themselves on fold geometry. We approximate surge-type behaviour in a suite of synthetic glaciers using a three-dimensional numerical ice-flow model. We then reconstruct glacier-scale fold trains using a particle tracking algorithm applied to the modelled velocity fields, and analyze folds for their sensitivity to valley geometry, surge behaviour, and climate-driven mass balance. The model results are used to characterise the kinematic evolution of this common glacier structure, to assess the sensitivity of fold geometry to the underlying flow regime, and to lay the groundwork for applying this modelling approach to interpreting the flow histories of surge-type glaciers in nature.\n\n\n2\nIce-flow modelling\nWe simulate ice flow across a range of synthetic glacier geometries and basal conditions approximating surge-type behaviour using Elmer\/Ice, an open-source full-Stokes finite-element model (Gagliardini et al., 2013) that is widely-used tool in the glaciological community (e.g. Gilbert et al., 2017; Collao-Barrios et al., 2018; Lilien et al., 2021), and recently adapted for use in a geological context (Zwinger et al., 2020). In this section we describe the modelling workflow and present the different flow regimes our approach produces.\n\n2.1\nIce-flow physics\nThe flow of a glacier can be described using equations derived from conservation principles, combined with an empirical constitutive relation. We solve the Stokes equations, which express the conservation of linear momentum and mass, to obtain time-dependent glacier velocity fields.

As is standard in ice-flow modelling, the glacier\u2013atmosphere interface is assumed to be stress-free. The boundary condition at the glacier bed takes the form of a sliding law. In this case, the sliding velocity is approximated using a linear friction law that relates basal shear stress \u03c4\n\nb\n to the tangential basal sliding velocity u\n\nb\n:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\u03c4\nb\n\n=\n\u03b2\n\n\nu\nb\n\n,\n\n\nwhere basal friction parameter \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u03b2(x, y, t) can be temporally and spatially varied to emulate slip associated with surge-type behaviour.\nThe model domain is set to exceed the horizontal and lateral extents of the synthetic glaciers, except at the uppermost boundary (details below). Where the domain exceeds the glacier extent, a boundary condition of zero ice thickness h is prescribed. In practice, we set h\u202f=\u202fh\nmin > 0 as required by Elmer\/Ice (e.g. Gilbert et al., 2016). The uppermost boundaries, characterized by a non-zero ice thickness for both tributaries, are treated as flow divides by imposing no-flux boundary conditions.\n\n\n2.3\nTemperature and fabric assumptions\nOur modelling approach is restricted to temperate glaciers and therefore assumes that the temperature of the ice is fixed to the local pressure melting point. Multiple studies highlight the role of glacier thermal structure as an important contributor to the difference in surge return intervals between glaciers found in different climate settings (e.g. Robin, 1969; Clarke, 1976; Mayer et al., 2011), with shorter return intervals generally associated with warmer environments and persistent temperate basal conditions (Murray et al., 2003). Surge return intervals also vary geographically (e.g. Bj\u00f6rnsson et al., 2003; Bhambri et al., 2017). Although glacier surging is observed across a range of glacier thermal regimes (e.g. Sevestre and Benn, 2015), some of the best-studied surge-type glaciers are temperate (e.g. Kamb et al., 1985), and some glaciers that are not entirely temperate still surge in a style similar to temperate glaciers (e.g. De Paoli and Flowers, 2009).\nWe further simplify the model by using an isotropic flow law for polycrystalline ice and exclude fabric development and evolution. Ice fabric has been shown to play a role in governing overall ice fluxes, for example within the shear margins of ice streams (e.g. Minchew et al., 2018; Hruby et al., 2020), and can be related to englacial structure development (e.g. Ross et al., 2020), but the use of an isotropic flow law for large-scale ice-flow modelling is common (e.g. van der Veen and Whillans, 1990). Our temperature and fabric assumptions lead to a constant flow-law parameter, A, in Equation (3).\n\n\n2.4\nSynthetic glaciers and simulated surging\nWe attempt to emulate surge-type behaviour in synthetic glaciers analogous to the large land-terminating glaciers found in the St. Elias Mountains of Yukon and Alaska. This region hosts a globally significant population of surge-type glaciers, with relatively short surge return intervals of decades or shorter (e.g. Eisen et al., 2005; Bevington and Copland, 2014; Kochtitzky et al., 2019; Nolan et al., 2021), compared to colder and drier regions such as Svalbard and the Canadian Arctic with centennial-scale surge return intervals (e.g. Hagen et al., 1993; Copland et al., 2003). Below we describe the four steps taken to generate these synthetic glaciers and force surge-like perturbations to their basal sliding regimes: (1) generation of initial synthetic glacier geometry, (2) generation of a three-dimensional numerical mesh, (3) model spin-up of a steady-state glacier for each glacier bed geometry, and (4) emulation of surge cycles.\n\n2.4.1\nInitial glacier geometry\nEach synthetic glacier is comprised of two confluent flow units and a main trunk (Fig. 2\n). We first generate a synthetic glacier bed by merging three surfaces that are parabolic in cross-section, each representing a glacial valley, either tributary or trunk. We introduce variations to this reference bed geometry (which is symmetric and of intermediate slope and confluence angle) by altering bed slope, tributary confluence angle, and tributary width ratio (Table 1\n). The reference bed geometry is used in the baseline simulation of glacier surging, with subsequent variations in glacier geometry, dynamics, and mass balance used to explore the influence of these factors on fold geometry. Variations in the geometric characteristics of glacial valleys that we control for have been suggested to influence surging behaviour (Kargel et al., 2005). The synthetic valley geometry is then overlain with an inclined plane that intersects the valley walls, intended as a crude representation of the glacier surface. This surface simply serves as an initial condition to the model to reduce the computation time needed to achieve steady state (\u00a72.4.3).\n\n\n2.4.2\nNumerical mesh\nA two-dimensional (plan-view) unstructured mesh of 500 m triangular elements is used to discretize the synthetic glacier valleys. The element size is sufficiently fine to resolve the folding in the synthetic glaciers while maintaining manageable simulation times. We find no significant influence of element size on structure geometry (see \u00a73.1.1). We use the finite-element meshing tool Gmsh (Geuzaine and Remacle, 2009) to create a two-dimensional triangular numerical mesh. This mesh is then vertically extruded, creating 10 equally spaced vertical levels everywhere in the model domain. This results in a three-dimensional numerical mesh that is triangular in plan view but rectangular in cross-section (Geuzaine and Remacle, 2009). Model elements outside the glacier footprint are assigned a non-zero passive ice thickness (as required by Elmer\/Ice), in this case 10 m, at which ice flow is disabled. Ice thickening at the glacier margins results in lateral expansion of the glacier.\n\n\n2.4.3\nModel spin-up\nSynthetic glacier geometries (e.g. Fig. 2b) are used as initial conditions for time-dependent model runs under fixed basal conditions (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f10\u22122 MPa m\u22121\u2009a in Equation (6)) and forced by a prescribed surface mass balance until steady state is achieved. We define steady state to be achieved when glacier volume changes by \n<\n1% over 50 model years. Surface mass balance \n\n\n\nb\ns\n\n\u0307\n\n\n is prescribed as a linear function of position x:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\nb\ns\n\n\u0307\n\n\n=\n\u0393\n\nx\n+\n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\nDV\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u0393\u202f=\u202f\u22121.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u2009a\u22121 is the balance gradient and \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\nDV\n\n is the prescribed mass balance at the ice divide (upstream boundary). Although more realistic, we do not use an elevation-dependent mass-balance function because mass-balance\u2013elevation feedbacks complicate the simulations in a way that distracts from our primary purpose. The value of \u0393 is fixed for all glacier geometries (Table 1), while \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\nDV\n\n is adjusted to produce an equilibrium line altitude (ELA, where \n\n\n\nb\ns\n\n\u0307\n\n\n=\n0\n) just above the confluence for each geometry. While these adjustments to \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\nDV\n\n result in small variations in the position and elevation of the ELA (see Supplementary Material), they preserve total accumulation across all geometries. The values of \u0393 and \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\nDV\n\n used in this study result in realistic surface mass-balance distributions (see Supplementary Material) and steady-state glacier geometries. Importantly, the simulated glacier lengths are sufficient to preserve fold trains that encompass multiple surge cycles. They are also similar enough across the different geometric tests (Table 1) that differences in steady-state ice flux through the confluence that would impact fold geometry are minimized. The parabolic valley geometry results in progressive narrowing of the glacier trunk with increasingly negative mass balance. This geometry can cause changes in longitudinal stresses that are accentuated within the terminus region away from the glacier centreline. This narrowing and related stress pattern could impact fold geometry when the simulated structures are advected into the terminus region. The time to reach steady state in the spin-up simulations varies from 400 (for StB) to 600 model years (for WC). These simulations transform the crude initial glacier geometry (Fig. 2b) into a more realistic and physically consistent glacier geometry (Fig. 2d) before sliding perturbations are introduced.\n\n\n2.4.4\nSimulated surging\nWe emulate the cyclic surging of a single tributary in our synthetic glacier simulations by forcing asymmetric thickening of the tributary, followed by transient and dramatic increases in flow velocity through reductions in the prescribed basal friction parameter \u03b2 (Equation (6)). Each surge cycle comprises three phases: (1) a 21-year quiescent flow phase during which the surge-type tributary experiences mass buildup, (2) a 21-year acceleration phase characterised by a gradual decrease in \u03b2, and (3) a two-year surging flow phase characterised by a rapid decrease in \u03b2 to its minimum value \u03b2\nmin. By implementing a three-phase surge cycle we endeavour to represent several characteristics of surge-type behaviour observed in the St. Elias Mountains (e.g. Frapp\u00e9 and Clarke, 2007), while maintaining numerical stability across multiple surge cycles for all synthetic glacier geometries.\nDuring the quiescent phase, we set \u03b2\u202f=\u202f10\u22121 MPa m\u22121\u2009a for the surging tributary and \u03b2\u202f=\u202f10\u22122 MPa m\u22121\u2009a (the spin-up value) elsewhere. This contrast in basal friction is intended to represent a realistic mechanism of mass accumulation in the surging tributary. Increases in basal friction during quiescence are not the only known cause of ice-reservoir development (e.g. Nolan et al., 2021), so we also prescribe an increase to the surface mass balance in the surging tributary by modifying \u0393 above the ELA such that a dynamic steady state is approximately achieved over multiple surge cycles (see Supplementary Material).\nDuring the acceleration phase, we prescribe an exponential decrease in \u03b2 from 10\u22121 to 10\u22123 MPa \u22121\u2009a for the surging tributary which causes a progressive increase in sliding velocities (e.g., Frapp\u00e9 and Clarke, 2007; Jay-Allemand et al., 2011). Finally, during the surging flow phase, we prescribe an instantaneous decrease in \u03b2 to 10\u22124 MPa m\u22121\u2009a, producing similar rapid velocity increases to those observed at the onset of surges, followed by an exponential decrease to \u03b2\nmin 10\u22126 MPa \u22121\u2009a.\nFor each geometry (Table 1), we model a total of four surge cycles following the spin-up to steady state, but discard the results of the first surge cycle so as to limit the inheritance of artefacts due the sudden transition between a homogeneous sliding history (during spin-up) and the heterogeneous sliding associated with the surge cycle. We therefore track structure change throughout multiple phases of deformation over 132 model years. In order to preserve numerical stability with these large changes in basal sliding, we implement a variable time-stepping scheme whereby the quiescent and acceleration phases use annual timesteps, while the surging flow phase uses 0.08 year timesteps. We repeat each of the above simulations for two other surge regimes: one defined by \u03b2\nmin\u202f=\u202f10\u22125 MPa m\u22121\u2009a (less vigorous) and one by \u03b2\nmin\u202f=\u202f10\u22126 MPa m\u22121\u2009a (more vigorous) (see Supplementary Material).\nIn addition to the simulations above, we also test the effects of (1) removing the acceleration phase of the surge (NoA simulation), (2) allowing the main trunk of the glacier to surge along with the tributary (TS simulation), (3) excluding the second and third surge-cycles (SS simulation), (4) prescribing values of \u03b2\nmin between the two end members, and (5) changing the prescribed surface mass balance.\n\n\n\n2.5\nFlow regimes in dynamic steady state\nAlthough highly stylized, our simulations of synthetic glaciers undergoing cyclic surge-like flow variations have many qualities that resemble reality (Fig. 3\n), and demonstrate that our approach to prescribing basal friction (\u03b2) and surface mass balance \n\n(\n\n\nb\ns\n\n\u0307\n\n)\n\n indeed leads to an approximate dynamic steady state for each glacier geometry.\nGiven the simple position-dependent prescribed mass-balance function (Equation (7)) and the inter-related nature of glacier dynamics and surface mass balance, it is non-trivial to achieve a dynamic steady state in the presence of dramatic changes in basal sliding. We achieve dynamic steady state by scaling \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n by 0.8\u20132.25\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00d7 in the reservoir region for the different glacier geometries (see Supplementary Material). Although peak velocities vary by up to \u223c20% over the three surge cycles shown in Fig. 3, glacier volume changes by \n<\n1% in all simulations. Given that we do not compare folds from different surges, but rather examine the role of multiple surges on an individual fold, we deem this variation in volume and velocity across surge cycles acceptable.\n\n\n2.6\nStructural glaciology of synthetic surge-type glaciers\nTime-varying fold geometry is derived from the Elmer\/Ice velocity solutions for each simulation. We use particle tracking software with a custom point-cloud to planar geometry conversion tool to convert 3-D particle clouds into arrays of planar segments with corresponding attitude measurements required for stereographic projection. We then present the geometry of the folds at multiple depth levels within the synthetic glaciers and at multiple time intervals corresponding to different phases of deformation.\n\n\n2.7\nDetermination of fold geometry\n\n2.7.1\nParticle tracking and extraction of planar attitude\nWe use the particle tracking capabilities of Paraview 5.8, an open-source scientific visualization platform (Ahrens et al., 2005), to track particles through the simulated surge cycles. Given that large folds in glacier ice are derived from passive folding with little mechanical influence of layer thickness or stiffness contrast (Hudleston, 2015; Jennings and Hambrey, 2021), using the velocity field to directly derive fold geometry is appropriate. The particles are sourced from 20 equally spaced nodes within a vertical column of ice positioned at the confluence of the tributary flow units. The injection location of the particles is intended to mimic a debris source for a medial moraine. While fold geometry is primarily expressed as the internal deflection of well-defined near-vertical foliation proximal to the interface between ice-flow units, surficial debris sourced from the confluence often highlights fold patterns along the interface. Particles are injected at every timestep and advected based on the trilinearly interpolated local velocity field v\n\ni\n(x, y, z, t) such that:\n\n(8)\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\u2032\n\n,\n\ny\n\u2032\n\n,\n\nz\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\n(\n\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n\nu\n,\nv\n,\nw\n\n)\n\n\u0394\nt\n,\n\n\nwhere (x\u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032) is the new position of the advected particle, (x, y, z) is the original position of the particle, and \u0394t is the time step.\nNote that the vertical spacing between injected particles is roughly half the element size in the numerical mesh, effectively interpolating fold geometry at half the model's vertical element spacing. We group the point cloud of advected particles into planar segments for every timestep, and developed a Python script to extract planar attitude (strike and dip) from these planar segments. For each surface defined by any three points, we compute attitude of the normal vector to the surface. Strike and dip are then determined by calculating the angular difference between the normal vector and two reference planes (vertical and horizontal for strike and dip, respectively). For the azimuth calculation, only the vertical component of the normal is used. Strike is considered perpendicular to the azimuth in the counter-clockwise direction, consistent with the right-hand rule. The strike is assigned a value between 0 and \u2013360\u00b0 using the sign of the components of the normal vector to determine the appropriate quadrant.\nIn the event of two or more points defining a planar segment possessing invalid coordinates (usually due to transport by emergent flow characterised by positive w values into vertical levels where the ice has been ablated), the segment is flagged and removed from strike and dip calculations for all subsequent timesteps. We then evaluate the sensitivity of particle transport to element size (see \u00a72.4.2) and find that finer and coarser meshes do not significantly impact structure geometries. Element sizes ranging from 350 to \u2013650 m cause variations in fold extent of \n<\n0.5\n%\n, and variations in associated mean strike and dip of \u223c2.5\u00b0 and \u223c3.8\u00b0, respectively, across the vertical and lateral extent of the fold train while preserving numerical stability (see Supplementary Material).\n\n\n2.7.2\nStructural analysis of model outputs\nThe conversion of the particle cloud to plane segments produces a time-dependent record of folding throughout multiple surge cycles. We define a complete surge cycle as the period of time beginning with the acceleration phase of a surge, and ending when the quiescent flow following a surge shifts to the acceleration phase of the subsequent surge. Only particles that define the fold formed during the first surge cycle (after the surge cycle that is discarded during spin-up) are analyzed in order to focus on the evolution of a single fold throughout the simulations. We focus on specific phases of deformation: (1) immediately following the conclusion of the surge cycle that developed the fold, (2) preceding the acceleration phase of the next surge cycle, and (3) at the conclusion of the final (third) surge cycle. These intervals highlight deformation related to surging flow, overprinting by quiescent flow, and the interference of multiple surge cycles, respectively.\nWe analyze each plane as described above, but present some of our results as averages over the upper, middle and lower thirds of the ice column. We characterisze the geometry of the modelled folds using a combination of structural metrics that describe fold tightness and axial planar alignment relative to the principal flow direction (e.g. Fleuty, 1964; Twiss, 1988). We do not report information on the limb-normal change in fold geometry (Ramsay, 1967) given the primarily passive nature of large-scale glacier folds (Hudleston, 2015; Jennings and Hambrey, 2021). Fold axes (FA), axial planar surfaces (AS), and interlimb angles (ILA) are measured at each timestep and for each depth interval (top, middle, and bottom).\nThe fold axes are determined by recording the pole to the \u03c0-girdle fitted to contoured distributions of poles to the modelled planar segments. We assess fold maturity over time, where the maturity is a combination of: (1) fold tightening (characterised by a reduction of the interlimb angle), (2) increased lateral shear-induced asymmetry relative to the principal flow direction (characterised by an increase of the axial surface strike from a flow normal value of 180\u00b0), and (3) increased basal shear-induced parallelism of the fold axis with the flow direction (characterised by alignment of the fold axis trend with the flow direction and decrease of the fold axis plunge as it rotates toward the horizontal).\n\n\n\n2.8\nResults of fold analysis\nHere we assess the sensitivity of simulated fold geometries to glacier geometry (Table 1) and surge intensity (by varying \u03b2\nmin). We then further explore the effects of variations in surge behaviour and the influence of positive and negative surface mass-balance anomalies.\n\n2.8.1\nPolyphase deformation: overview and notation\nFolding during glacier surging is the product of polyphase deformation, with the quiescent and surging flow fields representing different stress states during discrete intervals of time. Herein, we use structural geology notation to identify the phases of deformation corresponding to the change in stress state accompanying each surge cycle for the time intervals over which we analyze fold geometry. Note that in structural glaciology, primary stratification in the accumulation zone is typically identified as S\n0, and ice foliation emergent in the ablation zone is identified as S\n1 (e.g. Hambrey, 1977; Hambrey and Lawson, 2000). However, for the purposes of this study we assign the ice foliation as S\n0, in order to highlight the subsequent changes to the attitude of the initial vertically-dipping foliation before the simulated surge cycle occurs. Conceptually, we track the planar geometry representing ice foliation (S\n0) along the ice-flow unit contact that represents the orientation of planar segments throughout the surge cycle. The foliation changes throughout subsequent phases of deformation: from the initial interface between flow units (vertically dipping and striking parallel to the main flow direction), to the syn-kinematic deformation of these planes associated with surging flow and subsequent quiescent flow overprint.\nWe also track folding as it evolves through multiple phases of deformation (D\n\nn\n) associated with surging and quiescent flow, respectively. These phases of deformation are repeated for each surge cycle such that planar structural elements, and the folds these belong to, can be defined as being associated with D\n0, \u2026, D\n\nn\n, D\n\nn+1\u202fat any point in time, where n is the number of surge cycles that have occurred. While we simulate a continuum of deformation, and discrete phases do not completely capture the progression of deformation in an experimental setting with time-resolved strain accommodation, we focus on time intervals that capture the fold geometries for D\n1, D\n2, and D\n6. These phases of deformation are associated with the termination of the initial surge, the subsequent quiescent phase, and the downstream advection of the fold during two additional surge cycles.\n\n\n2.8.2\nFold response to changing glacier geometry\nWe describe the fold geometry in the bottom, middle, and top third of the ice column for the aforementioned phases of deformation resulting from three complete surge cycles (D\n1, D\n2, D\n6 at t\u202f=\u202f44, 65, 132\u2009a for the case of the most vigorous surge where \u03b2\nmin\u202f=\u202f10\u22126 MPa m\u22121\u2009a).\nThe D\n1 fold across all glacier geometries exhibits small differences in the extent of the deflection of S\n0. A depth-averaged axial surface strike of 189\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u00b0 demonstrates no pronounced axial surface asymmetry (Table 2, Fig. 6). The fold axis trend shows more variability, ranging from the NC simulation exhibiting a \u223c10\u00b0 divergence from flow-parallel, to the LT simulation exhibiting a \u223c40\u00b0 divergence. The variation in the deflection of S\n0 during D\n1 is expressed in both the magnitude of the interlimb angle and the fold axis plunge. The tightness of D\n1 folds is gentle throughout the ice column, with depth-averaged mean interlimb angle of 136\u202f\u00b1\u202f6\u00b0. Differences in interlimb angle between simulations are consistent with depth. In order of decreasing interlimb angle the simulations can be ranked as: ST, NC, ShB, Ref, WC, StB, LT (Table 2\n\n\n). The fold axis plunge values decrease consistently with depth, similarly to axial surface dips between vertical levels. These differences are minor near the surface and accentuated at depth.\nThe D\n2 fold geometry has a depth-averaged axial surface strike of 187\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u00b0 exhibiting little variability in strike between simulations, but greater depth-dependent dip decreases. The differences in alignment of the fold axis trend with the flow direction of D\n1 are now absent (Table 3, Fig. 6). The D\n2 folds are generally gentle at the surface, with a mean interlimb angle of 143\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u00b0, slightly more open than those of D\n1 near the surface due to counter-clockwise rotation of the upstream limbs. (Figs. 5 and 6). The folds tighten into open folds at depth: a mean interlimb angle of 132\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u00b0 is measured for the middle of the ice column, and a mean interlimb angle of 104\u202f\u00b1\u202f12\u00b0 is measured for the bottom depth interval. The ranking in interlimb angle variation between glacier geometries is the same as in D\n1 (Table 3). Vertical rotation of the fold axis for all geometries increases during D\n2, especially in the upper two-thirds of the ice column. In the bottom third of the ice column, fold axis plunge decreases, approaching shallow-to-horizontal attitude for all glacier geometries.\nThe D\n6 folds exhibit a significant increase in maturity following three surge cycles (e.g. Fig. 4\n\n\n). For most simulations, the axial surface asymmetry of D\n6 decreases slightly with depth: the mean axial surface strike is 215\u202f\u00b1\u202f19\u00b0 compared to 206\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u00b0 for the top and bottom thirds of the ice column, respectively (Table 4) (Figs. 4 and 6). This asymmetry is dominantly derived from cumulative clockwise rotation of the upstream limb (Fig. 5). Differences in tributary size produce the largest variation in axial surface asymmetry: the LT simulation produces a depth-averaged axial surface strike of 250\u00b0, while the ST simulation produces a depth-averaged axial surface strike of 186\u00b0 (effectively preserving the axial surface symmetry throughout the simulation) (Table 4). The ranking in the variability of interlimb angles with respect to geometry differs from those seen in D\n1 and D\n2 and is consistent with depth (Table 4, Fig. 4). The depth-averaged fold axis trend of 273\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u00b0, and plunge of 40\u202f\u00b1\u202f8\u00b0 for the top third transitioning to 4\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u00b0 for the bottom third, exhibits the pervasive alignment of the fold axes with the flow direction that approaches horizontal near the base of the glacier (e.g. Figs. 4, 5 and 6).\n\n\n2.8.3\nFold response to changing surge dynamics\nHere we describe the impact of varying glacier surge behaviour on the Ref geometry, by prescribing spatio-temporal variations in \u03b2 that depart from the previous simulations.\nDecreasing \u03b2\nmin values between 10\u22125 MPa m\u22121\u2009a and 10\u22126 MPa m\u22121\u2009a results in a non-linear increase in fold maturity. We observe an increase in axial surface strike, a decrease in interlimb angle, and decrease in fold axis plunge in the middle and top thirds of the ice column that correspond to increases in velocities during surging. The rate of change of each of these fold geometry metrics increases for \u03b2\nmin \u2264 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126 MPa m\u22121\u2009a (see Supplementary Material).\nIn simulation NoA we remove the acceleration phase leading up to the fastest phase of the surge, resulting in 42 years of quiescent flow and a sudden transition to two years of surging flow. Note that the magnitude of the decrease in \u03b2 during the surge itself is preserved. In simulation TS we decrease \u03b2 under the entire length of the main trunk of the glacier in addition to under the surging tributary, allowing both tributary and trunk to surge. Simulation SS is identical to Ref, but with just a single surge.\nAt D\n1, the NoA simulation produces a fold geometry with a slightly greater interlimb angle than the Ref simulation at all depths (Table 2) (Fig. 6). The TS simulation results in a fold geometry that is both more open (larger interlimb angle) and has steeper fold axis plunge values at all depths. At D\n2, both the NoA and TS folds display similar maturity to the Ref simulation (Table 3). They have similar top interval interlimb angles to the Ref simulation, corresponding to a tightening of the TS fold (interlimb angle reduction of 12\u00b0) and opening of the NoA fold similar to the Ref simulation (interlimb angle increases of 4\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 for the NoA and Ref D\n2 folds, respectively). The fold tightening in the TS simulation extends to the middle third of the glacier, while the post-surge unfolding is absent in the middle third in the NoA and Ref simulations. The fold axis in the TS simulation remains significantly steeper than in the NoA and Ref simulations. At D\n6, the TS simulation displays both a tighter fold geometry and more pronounced axial surface asymmetry than the NoA and Ref simulations, differences that remain consistent with depth (Table 4). The TS simulation also displays significantly more vertical fold axis values than the Ref and NoA simulations at all depth intervals. Across all depths the NoA simulation produces slightly less mature fold geometry than the Ref simulation, which in turn produces less mature fold geometry than the TS simulation.\nThe SS simulation produces folds that closely match those of the Ref simulation (Figs. 4 and 6) at D\n1 and D\n2. At D\n6, however, the SS simulation results in a less mature fold geometry characterised by greater interlimb angles, less axial surface strike increase, and more vertical fold axes at all depths (Table 4).\n\n\n2.8.4\nFold response to changing mass balance\nWe determine the sensitivity of fold geometry to positive and negative perturbations to the surface mass-balance regime by scaling \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n: a positive mass-balance anomaly simulation (PB) where \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n in the surging tributary is 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u00d7 the spin-up simulation value, and a negative mass-balance anomaly simulation (NB) where \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n in the surging tributary is equal to the spin-up simulation value.\nAt D\n1 the PB simulation produces a nearly identical fold geometry to the Ref simulation (Figs. 4 and 6), except for the fold axis plunge that decreases with depth to 9\u00b0 shallower. The NB simulation produces a more open fold with a steeper fold axis for the bottom third of the glacier (Table 2). The fold geometries of PB, NB, and Ref are similar for D\n2 due to variable post-surge unfolding of the folds (Table 3). At D\n6 the differences are more pronounced (Table 4). Folds produced after three surge cycles for the PB simulation display smaller interlimb angles, greater axial surface asymmetry, and more fold axis rotation. These differences are especially prominent at intermediate depths: the PB simulation produces a nearly horizontal fold axis and tight folding for the middle third of the glacier. The NB simulation produces significantly more open folds and less rotated axial surfaces than the Ref simulation, with geometry similar to the \u03b2\nmin\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126 MPa m\u22121\u2009a simulation (see Supplementary Material).\n\n\n\n2.9\nKinematic evolution of large-scale folds\nOur model results allow us to describe one archetype of fold evolution in surge-type glaciers. While differences between the synthetic glaciers produce variations in fold geometry and evolution (Fig. 4, Tables 2\u20134), the kinematic evolution of these structures is similar due to an overarching history of polyphase deformation, which combines the influence of two flow regimes: (1) basal and lateral shearing characteristic of ordinary or quiescent glacier flow and (2) the cyclic overprinting of (1) by transient surging flow oblique to the main glacier trunk. During quiescent flow, the folds are characterised by progressive rotation of their axes, nearing an orientation parallel to the main ice-flow direction with sufficient strain (Hudleston, 2015). In valley glaciers, these structures resemble sheath folds that have been transected by the glacier surface (cf. Alsop and Holdsworth, 2012; Fleming et al., 2013).\nAt D\n0, the contact between the two confluent flow units is a plane that is sub-parallel to the flow direction (Fig. 7\na). This plane does not experience rotation at kilometre scales, because it is already aligned with the flow direction. The switch to surging flow deflects the S\n0 surface due to the increased influx from the surging tributary, in this case oblique to main trunk, culminating in the D\n1 fold geometry present at surge termination (Fig. 7b). Upstream extension and downstream compression dominate the confluence region at this stage (Fig. 7b), as the discharge into the region exceeds that out of the region. During this phase of deformation, ongoing shear at the ice\u2013bed interface gives rise to variability in the D\n1 fold geometry with depth (Figs. 4\u20136). The initial D\n1 folds are characterized by gentle interlimb angles \n\n(\n\n>\n130\n\u00b0\n\n)\n\n (Table 2) at all depths. The fold axis plunge, however, exhibits a transition from near vertical at the surface to oblique near the glacier bed, generating syn-kinematic reclined folds near the bed.\nFollowing the initial glacier surge, the folds undergo progressive rotation of their axes (indicated by fold axis trends approaching \u223c270\u00b0 and progressively shallower fold axis plunges) due to quiescent flow during D\n2 (Figs. 5, 6 and 7c). The folds are located near the glacier centreline, with the initial rotation dominated by depth-dependent flow-parallel rotation of the fold axis plunges driven by basal shear. Following a surge, the flow velocities in the confluence region remain higher than immediately prior to the surge owing to the incomplete advection of the mass reservoir downstream. Propagation of the elevated residual velocities along the main trunk leaves extensional flow in their wake during D\n2 (Fig. 7c). This longitudinal strain-rate regime causes partial post-surge unfolding of D\n1 structures (Figs. 5 and 6), leading to an increase in interlimb angle of 1\u201310\u00b0 depending on the glacier. Once the folds have migrated away from the confluence region (during D\n3 to D\n6), they are subjected to persistent compressive flow and lateral shear, resulting in fold tightening (decreases in interlimb angle of 34\u201395\u00b0 depending on glacier geometry) (Fig. 7d). This pattern is repeated for new folds generated at the confluence during D\n3 and D\n5.\nThe folds display significant tightening over time (reduced interlimb angle as in Fig. 5) and increased axial surface asymmetry with advection. Any lateral displacement of the initial fold position from the glacier centreline is exploited by lateral shear and results in rotation of the axial surface strike toward flow parallel (from \n\u223c\n180\n\u00b0\n for axial surface strike at D\n2 to 189\u202f\u2212\u202f\u2212252\u00b0 by D\n6). This axial surface asymmetry is primarily derived from lateral rotation of the upstream limb at all depth intervals (Fig. 5), indicating that limb attitude relative to the lateral shear strain rate is instrumental to the increase of axial surface strike.\nThe polyphase history of deformation is especially discernible at this stage: closed to open reclined folds near the surface transition into increasingly tight recumbent folds with depth (Fig. 7d). This is in line with observations of metre-scale recumbent folding present at the beds of surge-type glaciers (Hambrey and Clarke, 2019; Jennings and Hambrey, 2021), and suggests that these folds can form (at least on large scales) entirely through passive flow in the absence of more complex bed topography often associated with observations of basal recumbent folds in non-surge-type glaciers (e.g. Hudleston, 1976).\n\n\n\n3\nInterpretation of surface fold geometry\nOur simulations produce folds that exhibit variable interlimb angles, and progressive rotation of both the fold axes and axial surfaces towards the principal flow direction (Tables 2\u20134). Prior to interpreting the structural characteristics of our model results in the context of observed folds, here we here we identify and explain the geometrical, dynamic, and mass balance influences on surface fold geometry.\n\n3.1\nFold sensitivity to glacier geometry\nWe assess the relationship between glacier geometry and folding at the surface by discussing the dynamic controls on interlimb angle and axial surface. Given that the total strain history is effectively expressed as the fold itself, we target representative strain-rate regimes at different phases of deformation along the particle path to dissect the dynamic drivers of variation in fold geometry. The maximum strain rates along the particle path are extracted for the final time steps of both surging and quiescent (before the acceleration phase) phases of the simulations. The position of maximum strain rate varies along the particle paths (but remains proximal to the fold) depending on the phase of deformation and component of the strain rate. Specifically, we examine the relationship between interlimb angle at D\n1, D\n2, D\n6, and axial surface strike at D\n6, and various components of the surface strain-rate tensor during surging and quiescent flow. While local strain rates are not equivalent to the strain histories responsible for the folds, correlations between local strain-rate components and fold metrics serve to highlight some of dominant influences on fold geometry. Note that a lack of correlation between instantaneous strain rates and different fold metrics does not necessarily imply a lack of relationship between fold geometry and the cumulative strain field that has shaped the fold. During surging flow, we find a correlation between the D\n1 interlimb angle and the longitudinal normal component of the strain rate \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n as well as the lateral shear strain rate \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n (Fig. 8\na). At D\n2, interlimb angles correlate best with the shear strain-rate (Fig. 8b). Both the D\n6 interlimb angle and axial surface strike correlate with \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n during quiescent flow (Fig. 8c and d). These correlations corroborate the interpretation that the initial deflection of S\n0 depends on discharge patterns in the confluence region and the formation of bottlenecks as indicated by \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n (and to a lesser extent \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\ny\ny\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n), while axial surface asymmetry development and fold tightening are sensitive primarily to lateral shear and the resultant rotation of the up-glacier limb of the fold following the initial transverse displacement from the glacier centreline present at D\n0.\nThe extent of axial surface asymmetry (characterised by increasing axial surface strike) of D\n6 folds varies based on offset of the initial D\n1 fold from the main trunk centreline to be exploited by lateral shear during downstream transport. The dependence on offset can be used to further explain the role of \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n during quiescent flow in shaping downstream fold maturity. We define this transverse offset as the lateral difference in particle positions at D\n0 and those along the fold axis at subsequent phases of deformation (usually south of the central flowline). Given that the initial S\n0 surface is aligned with the confluence and not necessarily the central flowline of the main trunk, the folds in each simulation are emplaced at various locations relative to the central flowline. Therefore, tributary asymmetry can exert an important control on axial surface asymmetry of the folds after their emplacement. In the ST simulation, S\n0 is 80 m north of the glacier centreline (due to the asymmetry in the quiescent flow field and slight deflection of the particle path to the north) and the initial offset of S\n0 following D\n1 is small (118 m) compared to the average initial offset for these simulations (304\u202f\u00b1\u202f112 m). Subsequent deformation reduces the interlimb angle (and increases the offset to 264 m, compared to a cross-simulation average of 364\u202f\u00b1\u202f77 m), but the fold axial surface remains symmetric due to minimal lateral shearing near the central flowline. The opposite is true of the LT simulation (with an intermediate effect for other geometrical simulations), because the initial S\n0 surface is already positioned 110 m south of the centreline, and the surge further increases this offset (varying from 380 m following D\n1 to 468 m at D\n6). This offset corresponds to increased proximity to the valley walls, and axial surface asymmetry is accentuated due to the greater rotation of the up-glacier limb (indicated by greater values of \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n). The relative lack of axial surface asymmetry observed in the NC simulation could also be attributed to a comparatively small offset (varying from 219 m at D\n1 to 290 m at D\n6), and correspondingly low \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n. This would suggest that narrowing the confluence angle, like tributary asymmetry, can hinder the development of axial surface asymmetry due to preferential partitioning of ice flux toward the longitudinal flow direction during surging.\n\n\n3.2\nFold sensitivity to surge dynamics\nResults from the NoA, SS, and TS simulations offer insight into the role of surging flow in shaping fold geometries. Eliminating the acceleration phase of the surge cycle results in a slight decrease of the D\n1 fold maturity, and a decrease in the axial surface strike and increase in the interlimb angle of the D\n6 fold. This suggests that while an acceleration phase may be present in both polythermal and temperate glacier surge cycles (Frapp\u00e9 and Clarke, 2007; Jay-Allemand et al., 2011), the acceleration phase itself does not significantly impact the resulting fold geometry. When simulating only a single surge cycle (SS) we observe a similar decrease of the D\n6 fold maturity (Table 4) (an increase in interlimb angle and decrease in axial surface strike), demonstrating that subsequent upstream surges can shape the geometry of pre-existing folds to a limited extent.\nIn the TS simulation, an increase in fold maturity occurs due to the comparatively unimpeded flow through the confluence (Fig. 8). This simulation exhibits the least negative values of \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n during surging, and is the only simulation with positive values of \n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n in the confluence, indicative of local dynamic thinning of the ice during surging. The comparatively unconstrained flow results in a greater initial lateral displacement (712 m) of S\n0 from the centreline. During D\n2, post-surge unfolding is absent, and we instead observe post-surge tightening of the D\n2 fold (Table 3). High residual velocities are located in the lower half of the main trunk and decay in-situ rather than migrating downglacier. In the non-surging tributary, background velocities are greater than the residual velocities in the confluence region, resulting in compressive flow (Fig. 8) that reduces the fold interlimb angle. This tighter fold geometry persists into D\n6 (Table 4). Our simulations demonstrate that the intensity and extent of surging flow can dampen or accelerate the maturation of the folds.\n\n\n3.3\nFold sensitivity to mass balance\nPerturbations to the dynamic steady state of our simulations produce small differences in D\n1 and D\n2 fold geometries (Tables 2 & 3Tables 2 and 3), but significantly influence D\n6 folds. The D\n6 fold geometry displays a decrease and increase in maturity for the NB and PB simulations, respectively (Table 4). Changing \n\n\nb\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n causes changes in reservoir build-up, modifying discharge patterns during surging. While these changes are not sufficient to significantly impact the deflection of S\n0, they do alter D\n6 folds. Clarke and Hambrey (2019) demonstrate that changing the spatial mass-balance pattern (by introducing localized anomalies) has little effect on the subsequent fold geometry if the mass-balance anomalies do not significantly alter the overall flow regime. Our results indicate that mass-balance anomalies confined to the reservoir area of the surge-type glacier can accentuate folding on timescales of multiple surge cycles.\n\n\n3.4\nSynthesis of modelled fold\u2013glacier parameter sensitivity\nAnalysis of the D\n6 fold across simulations demonstrates that glacier geometry exerts the greatest influence on fold maturity. Tributary asymmetry in the form of a larger surge-type tributary produces the most tightly folded interface in our simulations, while changing other geometric parameters produces a range of fold geometries that encompasses the variability observed across the changing dynamic and mass balance simulations. However, reducing the magnitude of sliding during surging flow can significantly reduce the range of fold geometries produced (see Supplementary Material). This suggests that while glacier geometry plays an important role in shaping folds in surge-type glaciers, differences in the magnitude of sliding exert a primary control on what range of fold geometries is possible.\n\n\n\n4\nApplication to folds in real glaciers\nOur analysis offers a baseline for interpreting the surface exposures of large-scale folds on surge-type glaciers. In this section we discuss the applicability of our study results to the qualitative interpretation of surge-type glacier folds, and identify specific parameter combinations that lead to more complex but realistic fold geometries.\n\n4.1\nModel limitations\nThe interpretive power of our analysis depends on the similarity of glacier flow regimes that control folding in the model versus in nature, and the applicability and range of the glacier geometries we use in the simulations. In emulating surges by directly prescribing changes in basal friction, we do not model the underlying processes that drive surging in real glaciers, such as those associated with thermal regime or basal hydrology. Given that the passive folds we simulate are directly derived from the perturbations of the velocity field, fold geometry should evolve correctly if the velocity patterns seen in surge-type glaciers are accurately reproduced. Differences in the flow regime in our model that might influence structure development include the prevalence of brittle deformation during surging and the spatial propagation of surging flow from its onset region. During a surge, glaciers experience widespread fracturing and crevasse reactivation due to intense extensional flow as well as thrust faulting or reactivation of closed arcuate crevasses by compressive flow where a surge front encounters stagnant ice or in the glacier terminus region (e.g. Meier and Post, 1969; Sharp, 1988; Lawson et al., 1994; Herzfeld and Mayer, 1997; Moore et al., 2010; Hudleston, 2015; Trantow and Herzfeld, 2018), suggesting that this mode of deformation could play a non-negligible role in strain accommodation that could influence the initial deflection of S\n0. Observations suggest that most of the displacement during surges is accommodated by increased basal slip (Kamb et al., 1985; Lawson et al., 1994), with exceptions at the terminus where significant shortening can be partitioned onto imbricate fault systems (Lawson et al., 1994).\nWhile the model closely approximates the magnitude of the velocity enhancement associated with surging (Fig. 3) and has surge initiation occur in the upper glacier, we have made no attempt to emulate the observed spatial propagation of surges away from the location of initiation (e.g. Eisen et al., 2005; Quincey et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2019). The spatially fixed switch to low basal friction beneath the surging tributary in the model is therefore a simplification. However, peak syn-kinematic deformation during surges is only observed when velocity increases occur locally (Lawson et al., 1994), similar to our treatment of the S\n0 deflection. Instances of sudden (both temporally and spatially) rapid glacier flow have been observed (K\u00e4\u00e4b et al., 2021), often resulting in catastrophic decoupling of ice and bed. These events suggest that while our method is a simplification of the spatial pattern of surge initiation, it can be situated within a spectrum of physically-consistent fast glacier-flow regimes.\nOur dynamic simulations focus on the role of changing basal conditions, but we recognize that the influence of changing the rheological behaviour of the ice impacts the velocity solution (Gagliardini et al., 2013), and may alter the associated fold geometries by modifying the strain-rate field. Previous work has demonstrated that uncertainty associated with the flow law is far smaller than that associated with basal conditions (e.g. Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2012). This suggests that the sensitivity of fold geometry to flow-law parameters is of secondary importance, but the prevalence of surge-type glaciers across thermal regimes would certainly warrant further study.\nGeometrically, we consider only a single tributary junction, thereby simplifying the range of complexity associated with multiple confluences. We also restrict surge-like behaviour to one tributary of a large glacier, whereas surging can occur in multiple tributaries in real settings and in smaller glaciers. Despite these simplifications, our study successfully replicates qualitative observations of flow regimes in the confluence regions of large valley glaciers (e.g. Gudmundsson, 1999; Glasser and Gudmundsson, 2012).\n\n\n4.2\nReading the fold record\nWe have focused our qualitative interpretation of folding on the surface trace of folds in surge-type glaciers. The interlimb angle and axial surface strike can be used to evaluate the flow histories of surge-type glaciers in the confluences where the interpreted folds are formed. We identify four elements of the flow histories of surge-type glaciers that can be observed in the surface expressions of these folds:\n\n(1)\nThe interlimb angle of a fold is directly associated with the initial deflection of S\n0 if the fold is recent (located near the confluence of origin). A smaller D\n1 interlimb angle is associated with greater longitudinal compressive flow. Valley geometry can provide context, with departures from this pattern being further explored as symptoms of differences in dynamic behaviour during surging.\n\n\n(2)\nThe path to tighter folds situated downstream of their origin is non-unique, reflecting differences in valley geometry and lateral shearing during quiescent flow, differences in surging flow, or even a departure from dynamic steady state. With known glacier geometry, however, anomalously tight folds in the absence of a large surging tributary may be used to qualitatively identify a greater magnitude of past surges. This interpretation may be complicated by long-term trends in mass balance (e.g., Wouters et al., 2019; Hugonnet et al., 2021), given that mass-balance anomalies persisting over multiple surge cycles can impact the interlimb angle and axial surface strike magnitudes of folds (Table 4).\n\n\n(3)\nMultiple folds that preserve axial surface strike values sub-normal to the flow direction likely reflect a geometrical control: either confluence asymmetry with a smaller surging tributary (similar to ST), or a confluence angle \n<\n90\n\u00b0\n that limits the initial S\n0 deflection (similar to NC). If neither of these geometrical criteria are met, reduced S\n0 deflection due to less vigourous surging can be considered.\n\n\n(4)\nThe origin of surging flow can be attributed to a specific tributary based on folds situated downstream of the confluence if axial surface asymmetry is present. Lateral drag primarily results in rotation of the up-glacier fold limb, with increasing rotation normal to the flow direction resulting in increased axial surface strike. Note that this asymmetry exists on both sides of the glacier with sufficient proximity to the margins, and the above interpretation cannot be used in the case of significant confluence asymmetry or off-centre debris sourcing.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nToward simulation of observed folds\nFold geometries in real surge-type glaciers (Fig. 1) vary much more than the simulation results we have presented. Observable structures display further complexity due to flow patterns that can be visible throughout the main trunk of glaciers with complex debris patterns inherited from upstream confluences (e.g. Jennings et al., 2014). Our model can be applied to more complex flow regimes and to predict observable structures as a function of the debris source location. In this section we briefly demonstrate how specific glacier-flow regimes give rise to fold geometries that bear a qualitative resemblance to those observed (Fig. 9\n). This exercise serves as a proof of concept for the application of our approach to real-world settings.\nLooped moraines represent an iconic glacier fold geometry (Gripp, 1929; Post, 1969; Dowdeswell and Williams, 1997) (Fig. 1a), wherein surface debris trails are pinched off during isoclinal folding along the glacier margin (Fig. 9c). Our model can produce folds evocative of looped moraines through a combination of a small surging tributary, a high rate of reservoir growth during quiescence, and a short but vigorous surge. The combination of an extremely brief and vigorous surge in a small tributary results in a fold with an axial surface that is rapidly rotated to approach parallelism with the main flow direction. Then, the upstream limb of the fold is pressed closer to the valley wall due to the low quiescent discharge from the depleted tributary.\nMultiple isoclinal folds oblique to the flow direction are often observed near glacier termini (e.g. Post, 1969; 1972; Lawson et al., 1994) where compressive flow dominates (Fig. 1b). Short intervals between emplacement of the folds (well off the centreline due to tributary asymmetry) creates folds that experience limited axial surface rotation during transport to the glacier terminus (Fig. 9d). Once in the terminus region, they experience dramatic reductions in interlimb angle. Our simple model geometry does not capture the switch from lateral shear to dominantly compressive flow in the termini of glaciers in wide valleys or flat plains (such as in the case of piedmont lobes).\nRepeated folding without downstream increase in axial surface strike can occasionally be observed in valleys with simple geometries (Fig. 1c). Conversely, folds with progressively increased axial surface asymmetry associated with each subsequent downstream fold can also be seen in similar valley types (Fig. 1d). We demonstrate that the results of both our tributary asymmetry tests (ST and LT simulations) produce similar fold patterns (Fig. 9a and b). Notably, the patterns of surface deformation highlight the change in asymmetry of the folds with increasing distance of the medial moraines away from the surge-type tributary, similar to observed fold patterns (Fig. 1c and d).\n\n\n\n5\nSummary\nWe have successfully emulated the three-dimensional geometric evolution of folds observed in surge-type glaciers using a full-Stokes numerical model of ice flow applied to synthetic glaciers. The simulation results allow a quantitative interpretation of the kinematic evolution of folds through multiple surge cycles, from vertically plunging gentle folds immediately following a surge, to complex recumbent-to-reclined structures that reflect a history of polyphase deformation driven by dynamically unstable glacier flow. We further elucidate the link between glacier flow regime and fold geometry across the geometric and dynamic characteristics of our synthetic glaciers: tightening and rotation of the folds correlate with the intensity of compressive flow within the tributary confluence region during surging, and the intensity of lateral shearing during subsequent phases of deformation. Downstream fold maturity is a function of the underlying valley geometry and the controls on glacier flow regime: narrower confluences and smaller surge-type tributaries limit the initial deflection of S\n0, while increasing the area of the glacier bed subjected to low basal traction during a surge or increasing the reservoir mass balance can accentuate eventual D\n6 fold asymmetry. Finally, we demonstrate that various characteristics of observed folds can be simulated using slightly more complex parameter combinations. This proof-of-concept study sets the stage for further quantitative structural analyses of surge-type glaciers, including the inference of ice-flow histories from observable surface structures.\n\n\nData availability\nThe python scripts for generating synthetic glacier surface and bed DEMs, the Elmer\/Ice.sif files for spin-up and surge cycle simulations, and the python script for extracting structure attitude from paraview-exported point clouds are available at https:\/\/github.com\/EMY-earthstuff\/Elmer3D_folds.git.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nEY and GF conceived of the study and EY developed the details.

In some ways, he was perhaps lucky to have undertaken a lot of his work before the theoretical studies of Biot became entrenched as a dogma in the study of folds since his observations, unlike those of a host of others, were not clouded by the interpretations and generalizations associated with Biot's results. Although Ramsay (1967) acknowledges Biot's work as \u201cstimulating\u201d, except for quoting and accepting Biot's scaling effect of wavelength in terms of layer thickness, he shows and discusses a range of fold geometries and processes based on field observations and unrelated to Biot's arguments. In particular, these examples involve localized folding, and various processes that lead to non-concentric folding; The experimental folds of John Ramsay [27, Figures 3.51, 7.29, 7.35] and others (Blay et al., 1977; Cobbold, 1976; Hudleston, 1973; Watkinson, 1976) are localized rather than strictly periodic. The 3D model introduced in (M \u00fc hlhaus et al., 1998) describes basins and valleys as localized folded structures. Biot's folding theory assumes that the buckling layer is thin compared to its deflection; thus, we assume sin(\u03b8)\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b8 with \u03b8 being the deflection angle, which, when used in Biot's buckling equation, we describe as a linear combination of sines and cosines with a resultant range of wavelengths. Biot proceeded to show that just one wavelength grows fastest so that the resulting profile is always periodic. Many attempted extensions of the thin layer, small deflection theory to thick layers had little success (Fletcher, 1974; Schmalholz and Podladchikov, 2000; Smith, 1975, 1977). The issue is that the buckling of thick layers involves shear strains parallel to the layer, whereas such strains are small and neglected in thin layers. Thus, nonlinearity appears when studying the finite buckling of thick layers both by the complexity of the strain field and the displacement field description. This paper addresses both issues.\nSpatially localized structures and deformations are studied in various fields such as reaction-diffusion systems (Lee et al., 1994), liquid crystals (Joets and Ribotta, 1988; Kolodner, 1993; Lakes and Lakes, 2009; Lee et al., 1994; Love, 2013; M \u00fc hlhaus et al., 1998; Piegl and Tiller, 1987; Pirkl et al., 1993), and binary fluid flows (Kolodner, 1993). Subsequently, nonlinear viscoelastic models were proposed as alternatives to the assumption of sinusoidal formations. An explanation for the localized folds studies a strut on a nonlinear elastic foundation. The results were that the buckling of the strut localizes if the foundation softens as it is deformed (Hunt et al., 1989). Such softening behavior may originate from the nonlinear nature of the material or the multi-physics interactions (Hobbs et al., 2008). In this study, we propose a model that captures localized buckling, including the viscoelastic behavior of the foundation and the folding layer. We model the deforming layer as a plate whose lateral dimensions are much larger than its thickness.We embed this plate in a viscoelastic framework with softening-stiffening behavior. Then, following the pattern formation discussion in (Thompson and Stewart, 2002), we perform linear stability analysis to derive the dispersion relations to the thickness and mechanical properties of the plate. Next, we develop an isogeometric analysis solver with higher regularity [8,\u00a09] to simulate the resulting system of higher-order partial differential equations and solve the resulting discrete the first-order time derivatives in time using the generalized-\u03b1 method (Jansen et al., 2000). The time marching method delivers second-order accuracy as well as unconditional stability.\nWe organize the paper as follows. Section 2 describes the theory that supports our model and from this foundation, we derive our model in Section 3. Section 4 presents numerical results and compares the effects of viscosity. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5. Mathematical symbols are defined as they are introduced and are collated in Table 1\n. Table 2\n provides the description of the mathematical techniques exploited in this paper.\n\n\n2\nTheoretical formulation\nIn this section, we describe our folding models for geomaterials. We consider an inextensible viscoelastic layer embedded in a viscoelastic framework. We consider a Kelvin\u2013Voigt model in Section 2.1 and a Maxwell model in Section 2.2 to describe the viscoelastic behavior of the foundation and the plate. We model the effect of the structure's surrounding as a reaction from its foundation. For this, we utilize Winkler's idealization to represent the medium as a system of independent, closely spaced, discrete, and nonlinear elastic springs and nonlinear viscous dashpots (for more details, see (Het \u00e9 nyi and Hetbenyi, 1946; Timoshenko and Woinowsky -Krieger, 1959)). Figs. 1 and 2\n\n sketch our model in 1D and 2D.\n\n2.1\nKelvin\u2013Voigt viscoelastic model\nWe start with the Kelvin\u2013Voigt framework to model the viscoelastic response of the medium. Since the springs and dashpots representing the elastic and viscous behaviors, respectively, are arranged in parallel, the Kelvin\u2013Voigt model states that the strains in each component are equal:\n\n(2.1)\n\n\n\u03b5\ntotal\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\ne\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\nv\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b5 denotes the strain and subscripts e and v indicate the elastic and viscous parts, respectively. Accordingly, for the stress \u03c3, we have:\n\n(2.2)\n\n\n\u03c3\ntotal\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\ne\n\n+\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nwhich allows us to first derive the governing equations without the viscous behavior and later add it to the model. Thus, we define the domain \u03a9 as:\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u03a9\n\u2254\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n,\n\nx\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\u2208\n\nR\n3\n\n:\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\u2208\n\n\u03a9\n0\n\n,\n\nx\n3\n\n\u2208\n\n[\n\n\u2212\nh\n\/\n2\n,\nh\n\/\n2\n\n]\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nwith \u03a90\u2254(0, L\n1)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(0, L\n2) being the surface in the middle of the plate and h denoting the plate thickness. Then, we consider compressive forces P\n1 and P\n2 along x\n1 and x\n2 directions, respectively, applied on \u03a90. Fig. 2 sketches our model. We include the in-plane and the transverse displacements to introduce the displacement field by considering the bending and shear components. The bending parts of the in-plane displacements are similar to those given by the classical plate theory (Love, 2013). We model the effects of shear on the in-plane displacements using higher-order shear deformation theories, which results in the parabolic variations of shear strains through the thickness and vanishing on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate (Hebali et al., 2014). Thus, we define the displacement field u = (u\n1, u\n2, u\n3) as:\n\n(2.4)\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n1\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n,\n\nx\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nw\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\nx\n3\n3\n\n\n\n3\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n2\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n,\n\nx\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nw\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\nx\n3\n3\n\n\n\n3\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu\n3\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n,\n\nx\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n=\n\nw\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith w\n\nb\n and w\n\ns\n being the vertical deformations due to the bending and shear components, respectively.\nRemark 1. In our model, to simulate a 3D fold, we solve for two 2D unknowns (w\n\nb\n and w\n\ns\n) on the middle surface to obtain the vertical deflection w\u00a0=\u00a0w\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0w\n\ns\n. Next, we update the displacement field using (2.4) explicitly. In the numerical examples presented in Section 4, we show the vertical deflections w for different scenarios.\nUsing the von\u2013K\u00e1rm\u00e1n strain\u2013displacement relations, the strain components at an arbitrary point of the plate are related to the displacement field of the middle surface (2.4), the changes in the curvatures \u03ba\n1 and \u03ba\n2, and torsion \u03ba\n12 of the middle surface as (Cerda and Mahadevan, 2003):\n\n(2.5)\n\n\n\u03b5\n1\n\n=\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\u03ba\n1\n\n,\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n2\n\n=\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\u03ba\n2\n\n,\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n12\n\n=\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\u03ba\n12\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing closely the Kirchhoff-Love theory of plates, the rotation of the normal to the mid-surface reads (Love, 2013):\n\n(2.6)\n\n\n\u03b6\n1\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\nw\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n2\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\nw\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b6\n1 and \u03b6\n2 are the rotation with respect to the directions x\n1 and x\n2, respectively (see, Fig. 3\n).\nThus, from (2.4), we define the in-plane strains as:\n\n(2.7)\n\n\n\u03b5\n1\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\nw\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\nx\n3\n3\n\n\n\n3\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n2\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.8)\n\n\n\u03b5\n2\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\nw\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\nx\n3\n3\n\n\n\n3\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n2\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.9)\n\n\n\u03b5\n12\n\n=\n\u2212\n2\n\nx\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\nw\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n8\n\nx\n3\n3\n\n\n\n3\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nWe include the transverse shear strains using the following representation:\n\n(2.10)\n\n\n\u03b5\n13\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\nx\n3\n2\n\n\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n1\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.11)\n\n\n\u03b5\n23\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n4\n\nx\n3\n2\n\n\n\nh\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nw\ns\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n1\n\n,\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\n2\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nwhich implies that the transverse shear strains become zero at the top (z\u00a0=\u00a0h\/2) and bottom (z\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212h\/2) surfaces of the plate.

We discussed the effect of 0 < \u03bc\u00a0\u2264\u00a01 in the response of the framework in details. Here, we pick \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.25 and \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.3. In numerical examples, we choose the viscosity of the plate \u03c4\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a00 for an elastic fold and \n\n\u03c4\nc\n\n=\n50\n\n\n\u03b7\n2\n\n\nk\n1\n2\n\n\n for viscoelastic folds which results in \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0100. The layer thickness enters through (2.21).\nRemark 2. We can include the overburden pressure in the model as an additional term to the forcing (2.19); a constant negative term added to the model that favors downward deformations. Adding this term does not change the approach behind our analysis and numerical simulations.\n\n\n2.2\nMaxwell viscoelastic model\nHere, we modify (2.20) to allow the folding layers to be a Maxwell material. Considering the effect of a constant strain rate in a maxwell material, the constitutive model (2.12) rewritten as (Roylance, 2001):\n\n(2.23)\n\n\u03c3\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n=\n\u03c6\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\nE\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b5\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \n\u03c6\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\nc\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\nt\n\n\u03c4\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. The derivation follows the steps of the previous section where we derive a model using the Kelvin-Voigt response.

We show this evolution in Figure 7.\n\n\n\n3\nLinear-stability analysis\n\n3.1\nKelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model\nWe analyse the model's behavior by rewriting (2.22) as:\n\n(3.1)\n\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\n\n\u2254\n\n\u03a8\n\n(\nw\n)\n\n,\n\n\nwhere w\u00a0=\u00a0w\n\nb\n\u00a0+\u00a0w\n\ns\n. We first find the fixed points of the models in (2.22). For this, we require to find the stationary point of the energy functional, which is equivalent to the zeros of the resistive force f\n\ne\n(w)\u00a0=\u00a0w\u00a0\u2212\u00a0w\n3\u00a0+\u00a0\u03bcw\n5.

Softening results from the opening of fractures and pores as well as from the formation of elastically soft minerals. Hardening results from the closing of fractures and pores as well as from the formation of elastically hard minerals (Hobbs et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 1989).\nIn our model, the elastic response of the foundation initially softens under loading; once the displacements become large enough, its response stiffens due to the cubic\u2013quintic non-linear terms. Increasing the vertical displacement leads to softening the foundation due to the cubic term energetically favorable to buckle the beam further. As this deflection progresses, the quintic term increases, and eventually, this quintic term dominates and stiffens the foundation. We show this behavior in Fig. 4\n. In the upper pane of this figure, for initial deflections of the plate, the signs of f\n\ne\n and w are similar. That is, f\n\ne\n helps the plate to deflect more. This also increases the corresponding energy \n\n\u03a0\n\nf\ne\n\n\n (see, the lower pane of Fig. 4). Next, for 0 < \u03bc\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.25, increasing the vertical deflection of the plate w, the elastic force f\n\ne\n becomes zero and then increases its resistivity to the deformation. The evolution of \n\n\u03a0\n\nf\ne\n\n\n also validates this behavior as the energy decreases and is not in favour of the deflection anymore. From (3.2), we conclude that to have softening and re-stiffening behavior in the framework, one requires to choose 0 < \u03bc\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.25, as Fig. 4 shows.\nThen, linearizing the nonlinear model in the vicinity of the fixed points w\n\u22c6 using small perturbations, we obtain:\n\n(3.3)\n\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n=\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n+\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nInserting the perturbation ansatz (3.3) into (3.1), we have\n\n(3.4)\n\ng\n\n\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n+\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\u2248\ng\n\n(\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n)\n\n+\n\ng\n\u2032\n\n\n(\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n)\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n=\n\ng\n\u2032\n\n\n(\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n)\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we find that a linear ODE governs the growth of the perturbation \u03b4w(\u22c5, t), that is\n\n(3.5)\n\n\nd\n\nd\nt\n\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n=\n\ng\n\u2032\n\n\n(\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n)\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the solution of\n\n(3.6)\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n=\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\n0\n\n)\n\nexp\n\n\n\ng\n\u2032\n\n\n(\n\nw\n\u22c6\n\n)\n\nt\n\n\n.\n\n\nTherefore, if g\u2032(w\n\u22c6)\u00a0>\u00a00, the perturbation grows in the temporal domain, and the fixed point is linearly unstable. Whereas, for g\u2032(w\n\u22c6)\u00a0>\u00a00, the fixed point shows stable behavior, and the perturbation decays with the limit value of\n\n(3.7)\n\n\nlim\n\nt\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor further analysis, we consider a perturbation function for w\n\nb\n and w\n\ns\n in the form:\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u03b4\nw\n\n(\n\n\u22c5\n,\n\nt\n\n)\n\n=\n\u03b5\nexp\n\n\n\u03c3\nt\n\u2212\ni\nk\n\u22c5\nx\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere x\u2254(x\n1, x\n2), and k\u2254(k\n\nx1, k\n\nx2) is defined as the vector of modes in x\n1 and x\n2 directions. That is, k\n\nxi\n denotes the number of waves in direction x\n\ni\n. Substituting (3.8) into the model (2.20), we solve the obtained relation to obtain \u03c3.

We set \n\u03bb\n=\n\n\n\u03bb\n^\n\n\n=\n5\n,\n\nP\n=\n\u2212\n4\n,\n\n\u03bc\n=\n0.25\n\n\u03c3\n\nb\n denotes the Biot's dispersion relation. Fig. 5\n shows that Biot's model does not predict the folds that appear in the nonlinear model. Besides, the Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell materials predict similar dispersion relations. Fig. 6\n shows the effect of the layer thickness on the dispersion \u03c3\n0. By decreasing the thickness, \u03c3\n0 of models (2.20) and (2.24) approaches the dispersion predicted by Biot's model \u03c3\n\nb\n.\n\n\n3.4\nMaximum dispersion relations\nIn this way, using (3.9), we obtain the maximum dispersion, k\n\nm\n\u00a0=\u00a0|k|, in a Kelvin-Voigt material.

Both figures suggest that the maximum predicted dispersion remains constant when \u03bb becomes larger than four. Furthermore, the time-dependent dispersion relations based on the Maxwell model converge by increasing the time.\n\n\n\n4\nNumerical results\nWe now simulate the temporal evolution of the buckling of a 2D plate embedded in a viscoelastic framework. For this, firstly, we derive the weak form of the partial differential equation (2.22). Then, we use isogeometric analysis for the spatial discretization and derive the semi-discrete problem. Isogeometric analysis allows us to have sufficiently regular (for example, here, C\n1) basis functions (see (Cottrell et al., 2009; Cottrell et al., 2006)).\nFollowing standard notation for the Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, we define a functional space \nV\n=\n\n\nH\n\n2\n\n as a Sobolev space of square-integrable functions with square-integrable first and second derivatives. Next, we multiply (2.22) by test functions \nv\n,\n\nr\n\u2208\nV\n. Then, using integration by parts, the variational formulation is stated as follow: Find \n\nw\nb\n\n,\n\n\nw\ns\n\n\u2208\nV\n, such that:\n\n(4.1)\n\nB\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n,\n\n\nw\ns\n\n,\n\nv\n,\n\nr\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n,\n\n\u2200\n\nv\n,\n\nr\n\u2208\nV\n,\n\n\nwhere\n\n(4.2)\n\nB\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n,\n\n\nw\ns\n\n,\n\nv\n,\n\nr\n\n)\n\n\u2254\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u0394\n\nw\nb\n\n,\n\u0394\nv\n\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\n\u0394\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\nb\n\n,\n\u0394\nv\n\n)\n\n+\n\n1\n5\n\n\n(\n\n\u0394\n\nw\ns\n\n,\n\u0394\nv\n\n)\n\n+\n\n1\n5\n\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\n\u0394\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n,\n\u0394\nv\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nP\n\u2207\n\nw\nb\n\n,\n\u2207\nv\n\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\n)\n\n3\n\n+\n\u03bc\n\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\n)\n\n5\n\n,\nv\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n(\n\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\nb\n\n+\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n,\nv\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n\n\n(\n\n\u0394\n\nw\nb\n\n,\n\u0394\nr\n\n)\n\n+\n\n1\n5\n\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\n\u0394\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\nb\n\n,\n\u0394\nr\n\n)\n\n+\n\n1\n21\n\n\n(\n\n\u0394\n\nw\ns\n\n,\n\u0394\nr\n\n)\n\n+\n\n1\n21\n\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\n\u0394\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n,\n\u0394\nr\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\nA\nD\ns\n\n\u2207\n\nw\ns\n\n,\n\u2207\nr\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\n\nA\nD\ns\n\n\u2207\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n,\n\u2207\nr\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nP\n\u2207\n\nw\ns\n\n,\n\u2207\nr\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n(\n\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\nb\n\n+\n\n\nw\n\u0307\n\ns\n\n+\n\nw\nb\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\n)\n\n3\n\n+\n\u03bc\n\n\n(\n\n\nw\nb\n\n+\n\nw\ns\n\n\n)\n\n5\n\n,\nr\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we use an isogeometric analysis (IGA) discretization and define \n\n\nP\n\nh\n\n as a partition of the spatial domain \u03a9 into elements K and obtain \n\n\u03a9\nh\n\n\u2254\n\n\u22c3\n\nK\n\u2208\n\n\nP\n\nh\n\n\n\nK\n.

Based on the definition of \n\n\nV\n\nh\n\n, we need the discrete space to be at least \n\n\nH\n\n2\n\n-conforming globally. In this work, we satisfy this requirement by using a non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) basis with C\n1-continuity.\nWe derive the fully-discrete problem by partitioning the time interval [0, T] with a time step \u03c4 and use the generalized-\u03b1 method (Behnoudfar et al., 2020a, 2021; Jansen et al., 2000). Finally, we denote by \n\nW\nb\nn\n\n,\n\nW\ns\nn\n\n the approximations to \n\nw\nb\nh\n\n\n(\n\nt\nn\n\n)\n\n,\n\nw\ns\nh\n\n\n(\n\nt\nn\n\n)\n\n, respectively.\nRemark 7.\nTo complete our methodology for implementing the fully discrete problem, we use Newton's method to solve the resulting nonlinear equation. The iterative procedure can be summarized as computing the residual \nR\n\n(i), using \n\nW\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n with i denoting the i-th iteration. Next, computing the Jacobian \nj\n\n(i), we solve\n\n(4.6)\n\n\nj\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\u03b4\n\nW\n\n(\n\ni\n+\n1\n\n)\n\n\n=\n\nR\ni\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThen, we update \n\nW\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n(\n\ni\n+\n1\n\n)\n\n\n=\n\nW\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03b4\n\nW\n\n(\n\ni\n+\n1\n\n)\n\n\n. We repeat these steps until the norm of the global residual vector is below a tolerance (e.g., here, 10\u22128) of their initial value. We usually achieve convergence in 3\u20135 nonlinear iterations per time step. For more details, we refer the reader to (G \u00f3 mez et al., 2008; Vignal et al., 2015). The following results show the vertical deflections w on the domain. The horizontal deformations are updated based on the displacement field (2.4).\nWe consider a 2D domain [\u00a0\u2212\u00a040, 40]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0[\u00a0\u2212\u00a040, 40] and set \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.3 with a compressive force P\u00a0=\u00a04. We also use quadratic elements with C\n1 continuity and time step \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00.1. The Dirichlet conditions impose the deflection w and the curvature \n\n\n\n\u2202\n2\n\nw\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\ni\n2\n\n\n\n on the boundaries (here, they are equal to zero). The initial condition is set to\n\n(4.7)\n\n\nw\nb\n\n=\n\n0.0001\n\n\n(\n\n1\n+\n\nx\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n\n1\n+\n\ny\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nw\ns\n\n=\n0\n.\n\n\n\n\nWe also study the effects of viscosity on the layer's displacement response and its localized buckling by comparing two cases of \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00 (elastic layer) and \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0100 (viscoelastic layer). Fig. 9\n presents the results. In Figs. 10 and 11\n\n we show the cross-sections of the plate with thickness of h\u00a0=\u00a00.5 for elastic and viscoelastic plates, respectively. The viscous contribution in the layer delays the deformation. Compared with a folded elastic layer, the evolution shows a localized behavior.\nNext, we show the effect of the applied lateral forces. For this, we consider a viscoelastic layer and use our model (2.19) with \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0100 and \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.2 with similar domain, boundary and initial conditions. Fig. 12\n shows the evolution of folding when P\n1 = P\n2 and P\n1\u00a0=\u00a02P\n2. We also show the evolution of the cross-section of the simulated folds for both cases of equal and non-equal lateral forces in Figs. 13 and 14\n\n, respectively. Lastly, we consider a larger domain [\u00a0\u2212\u00a060, 60]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0[\u00a0\u2212\u00a060, 60]. We apply compressive forces of P\n1 = P\n2 = 4, and P\n1\u00a0=\u00a02P\n2\u00a0=\u00a04 with \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01. Fig. 15\n shows how the localized behavior still can be observed in both examples, showing domes and basins in (a) and more linear ridges and valleys in (b).\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe derive a model that captures localized buckling, including the viscoelastic behavior of the foundation and the folding layer. Using plate theory with nonlinear softening-stiffening behavior, we embed a plate in a viscoelastic framework. Then, we use the high-order shear deformation theory to incorporate shear strains in the thick layer parallel to the layering during folding. This shearing adds a nonlinearity that results in localized folding. We perform a linear stability analysis to derive the dispersion relations to the thickness and mechanical properties of the plate. We use an isogeometric solver with high regularity to simulate the resulting system of high-order partial differential equations (e.g., our model has fourth-order spatial derivatives) and solve the resulting semi-discrete problem using the generalized-\u03b1 method. This time marching method delivers second-order accuracy as well as unconditional stability. We show in the numerical examples how the viscoelastic layers deflect locally. Also, we provide numerical evidence on how the horizontal applied forces impact the folding. The horizontal loading helps us describe how dome and basin and linear ridges and valleys form according to the relative magnitudes of the applied forces.\nThe physical model we introduce also shows the following:\n\n\u25cf\nIncreasing the layer thickness increases the importance of layer parallel shearing, which results in localized folding for situations where the Biot analysis predicts strictly periodic folding.\n\n\n\u25cf\nThe dispersion relationships are a function of strain (time), whereas Biot's dispersion relation is time independent.\n\n\n\u25cf\nFor thick layers, more than one wavelength may amplify, as Fig. 5 shows, as opposed to Biot's result where only one wavelength amplifies.\n\n\n\u25cf\nThe relation between layer thickness and amplification is highly nonlinear, as Section 3.2 indicates. The wavelength increases as the layer thickness grows, as Fig. 6 shows, and is always larger than Biot's wavelength, as Fig. 5 indicates.\n\n\n\u25cf\nThe buckling behavior of both Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell materials is similar. Hence, from a geological point of view, their response may not be discernible from the available data.\n\n\n\u25cf\nLastly, we introduce a relation to describe the maximum dispersion as a function of layer thickness as\n\n\n\n\n(5.1)\n\n\n\nlim\n\n\n\n\nh\n3\n\n\u2192\n0\n\n\n\nk\nm\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\nk\n2\n2\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nk\n1\n\nE\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03bd\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\nk\n1\n2\n\n\n\nk\n3\n\n2\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03bd\n2\n\n\n\n\nP\n2\n\n\n\u03c4\nc\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\nk\n2\n4\n\nt\nE\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nk\n1\n2\n\nk\n3\nP\n\n\u03c4\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u00d7\n\n3\n\n1\n\/\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","35":"","36":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMicroscopic kinematic analysis is a common technique in structural geology to determine paleostress strain\/stress fields from outcrops (e.g. Etchecopar et al., 1981; Armijo et al., 1982; Ramsay and Huber, 1983, 1987; Reches, 1987; Angelier, 1990, Capote et al., 1990), which has evolved including complex fractal geometries (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2005), and has led to the development of numerical models beyond the classical view of the Anderson's fracture model (\u017dalohar and Vrabec, 2010). However, the paleostress reconstruction is constrained from the geological structures, which are commonly folded and faulted, determining the spatial distribution of the fault-slip data (Amrouch et al., 2010). Microstructural analysis can be applied in geologic gas storages, complementing it with other strain\/strain methods, such as earthquake focal mechanism solutions or calcite twin analysis (e.g. Lacombe, 2007).\nUnderground geologic gas storage sites are conceived as long-lived facilities, while geophysical monitoring is an essential practice for keeping industrial operations safe in the long-term future. One of the main concerns in underground gas storages is the possibility of triggering earthquakes. Preventing induced earthquakes during the injection\/withdrawal gas operations needs a knowledge of several geological parameters such as exiting fault and fracture networks, present-day stress and pressure conditions, geomechanical constraints regarding rock failure, total gas volume stored, and daily gas flow of the injected gas, among others.\nThe classical microstructural analysis of striation measurements on fault planes provides an economical and accessible method for estimating the paleostress\/-strain fields of geological reservoirs (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020), acting as a key parameter to understand the induced seismicity potential. Among others, the Right-Dihedral and the Slip Model methods (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020) can be applied to identify the strain field, whereas the stress field can be determined from the analysis of earthquake focal mechanism solutions. Hence, the coefficient of reactivation for fault sets affecting the reservoir can be determined, according to their agreement with the strain field, and their role in the reservoir permeability and as leakage pathways.\nThe geologic gas storage of Yela (Guadalajara, Central Spain, Fig. 1\n) is operating since 2012. It is a strategic storage facility for natural gas, which is stored and withdrawn according to the seasonal demand of the Spanish energy market. The Yela storage site is located in an intraplate tectonic zone, where no relevant earthquakes were recorded before the gas operations started. The Spanish Seismic Network, operated by the Geographical Institute of Spain (www.ign.es), have been recording and collecting earthquakes from 1985 with a magnitude of completeness of Mc\u00a0=\u00a01.5, where Mc is the minimum magnitude above which all earthquakes within the studied area are reliably. A set of micro earthquakes (n\u00a0=\u00a0141; M\u00a0<\u00a02.3) have been triggered since the starting of the injection\/extraction operations in 2012 in the influence area of the injection operations (a few kilometres).\nOn the other hand, the regional tectonic stress field in Yela was extrapolated from a few data of small-sized (3 > M\u00a0>\u00a04.5) intraplate earthquakes located in the vicinity (50\u00a0km away, Herraiz et al., 2000; Giner-Robles et al., 2012). More extensive studies of the strain\/stress field could help to understand the injected fluid interaction with the recorded microseismicity, the fault reactivation, and therefore, prevent a future seismic occurrence. Moreover, the strain\/stress determination facilitates earthquake hazard information applicable to other sub-surface injection operations, such as oil and gas production or CO2 storages (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020).\nThe aim of this work is to determine the potential induced seismicity at the Yela gas storage site, the role of the strain\/stress field, and those fault sets prone to move and act as leakage pathways. In this way, we have analysed the microscopic kinematic data from fault-slip slickensides and the macroscopic and regional strain\/stress field derived from earthquake focal mechanism solutions. In total, 24 outcrops with 375 slip data were measured and analysed. We have estimated the potential fault sets reactivated under the current stress\/strain field, and their role as leaking pathways for the injected gas. Finally, we have studied the induced seismicity during the injection\/withdrawal operations at Yela site. Our results show small clusters of induced earthquakes during the winter injection operations, lasting from November to February. These seismic clusters appeared for the first time in 2012 coinciding with the starting gas operations, and appeared annually until 2021. Although the gas storage facility is working at its maximum capacity, the recorded induced earthquake activities have decreased in frequency and magnitude over the last period from 2017 to 2021.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe underground natural gas storage facility of Yela is located in the northeastern extent of the Madrid Basin, central Spain (Fig. 1a). The Cenozoic Madrid Basin is bordered by the intraplate mountain range Central System to the north and the fold and thrust belt Iberian Chain to the northeast developed during the Cenozoic (Fig. 1a). The basin was filled and deformed during Cenozoic times due to the folding of the Iberian Peninsula lithosphere related to the convergence between Iberia and Eurasian plates (Cloetingh et al., 2002). The Central System consists of intraplate thick-skinned basement pop-up oriented E-W to NE-SW, of Oligocene-lower Miocene in age, while some structures were reactivated during the upper Miocene-Pliocene (de Vicente et al., 2007). However, to the NE, the compressional deformation is distributed by syntectonic fault-propagation folds (de Vicente and Mu\u00f1oz-Mart\u00edn, 2013), induced by SE-directed basement-involved thrust faults (Fig. 1c). To the east, the Madrid Basin is connected with the Iberian Chain, which consists of a NW-SE intraplate deformation belt, formed during the Cenozoic inversion of the Iberian Basin (e.g. Guimer\u00e0 et al., 2004). The occurrence of NW-SE folds is related to basement-involved thrusts and positive flower structures, partially covered by the Cenozoic sediments of the Madrid Basin (Fig. 1c).\nThe Cenozoic Madrid Basin lies was deposited on a sedimentary cover consisting of clastic Permian-Triassic succession followed by Middle to Upper Triassic carbonates including evaporitic sequences. The Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sequences are missing in the area. This omission is related to the no deposition beyond the current mountain ranges, which in turn were Mesozoic rift areas. The sedimentary record of the Madrid Basin is rather continuous from the Late Cretaceous to the late Miocene, deposited in continental environments and showing different lithology such as sandstones, claystones, marls, limestones or gypsum.\nThe Oligocene-Lower Miocene sedimentary infilling coincide with the maximum tectonic activity at the basin borders, which produced progressive discordances associated with folds of different orientation (de Vicente and Mu\u00f1oz-Mart\u00edn, 2013 and references therein). The main tectonic structure in the area consists of a large SE-directed crustal-scale thrust, which puts in contact the southern margin of the Central System with the Madrid Basin (Fig. 1b). This regional structure is represented by a basement flexure determined by a NE-trending axis, which is related with instrumental seismicity of magnitude maximum as M\u00a0=\u00a04.2 (Escopete earthquake, 7th June of 2007), and shallow earthquakes (<10\u00a0km) with normal focal mechanisms (Giner-Robles et al., 2012). This basement flexure is in agreement with the regional stress\/strain tensor defined by Herraiz et al. (2000).\nThe geologic gas storage of Yela is an underground natural gas and strategic reservoir. This reservoir consists of a saline aquifer in a carbonate succession, 8\u00a0km long with a NE-SW trend, and covering an area of 25\u00a0km2. The depth of the reservoir ranges between 2,300 and 2,550\u00a0m, and the total storage volume is ca 6.25\u00a0km3. The lithology of the reservoir is represented by the \u201cSanta B\u00e1rbara\u201d formation, which consists of Cretaceous carbonates, mainly dolostones (Conian-Santonian) affected by a diffuse fracture network, overlain and sealed by evaporitic facies. The structural trap consists of a NE-SW fault-propagation fold (Fig. 1), accommodated on a SE-directed thrust, NE-SW oriented (Figs. 1a and 4).\n\n\n3\nMethods and rationale\nStress and strain fields play a relevant role in the permeability of underground gas reservoirs. The reservoir is affected by the tectonic field, especially when increasing gas pressure that might promote leakage (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020). The estimation of 3D fracture networks relative to the active stress and strain fields within the reservoir allows to prevent the induced seismicity related to fluid injection or withdrawal by deploying seismic arrays.\nThe application of the common techniques of paleostress analysis in field outcrops (i.e. Etchecopar et al., 1981; Reches, 1983; Angelier, 1990; Delvaux and Sperner, 2003), provides the local strain\/stress field evolution through time in a reservoir (P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020). These techniques estimate the stress\/strain fields by measuring grooves and slickensides on fault planes (Reches, 1983), among other displacement indicators. The strain tensor is an ellipsoid defined by the orientation of the principal axes, which can be projected in the plane, ey\u00a0=\u00a0maximum horizontal shortening, ex\u00a0=\u00a0minimum horizontal shortening, and ez\u00a0=\u00a0vertical strain, and the shape of the ellipsoid. This method assumes that the fault slip-vector defines a common strain tensor within a homogeneous tectonic setting. We assume that the strain field is homogeneous in space and time and the number of faults activated is greater than 5 (orthorhombic tensor), while the slip vector is parallel to the maximum shear stress (\u03c4). Here we have used the horizontal shortening, a 2D projection of the strain tensor (Ramsay and Huber, 1983) to define the strain tensor affecting the geologic gas storage. In this work, we have performed an analysis of the fault kinematics, by measuring slickenfibers on fault planes (dip, dip-direction, and rake), in several outcrops in the surroundings of the reservoir (20\u00a0km away from the Yela gas reservoir). The paleostrain inversion method has been applied in fault planes present in Cretaceous and Neogene successions (late Miocene to present-day).\n\n3.1\nThe right-dihedral model for paleostrain analysis\n\nRamsay (1967) pointed out that strain is mainly a matter of geometry. The Right-Dihedral method (RD) is a semi-quantitative method based on the overlapping of compressional and extensional zones by using a stereographic plot. The result is an interferogram plot, which defines the tectonic strain-regime. This method provides robust results for conjugate fault sets with different dip values for the same strain tensor, drawing different plot symmetry (dihedron) according to the type of the strain tensor (extensional, compressional and strike-slip). This method was originally defined by Angelier and Mechler (1977), as a geometric method, adjusting the measured fault-slip data (slickensides) in agreement with the theoretical models for extension and compressive fault-slip. We can constrain the regions of maximum compression and extension related to the strain regime in the final dihedron.\n\n\n3.2\nThe Slip Model for the paleostrain analysis\nThe Slip Model (SM) is based on the Navier-Coulomb fracturing criteria (Reches, 1983), taking the Anderson model solution (Anderson, 1951; Simpson, 1997). The Anderson model is based on the quantitative parameters of the tensor shape parameter with the internal frictional angle for rocks (\u03c6, Capote et al., 1991). This model shows the relationships between the tensor shape, \u03c6 and the direction cosines for the striation on the fault plane (Capote et al., 1991).\n\n\n3.3\nThe K\u2019 strain diagram\nThe K\u2032-diagram (Kaverina et al., 1996; \u00c1lvarez-G\u00f3mez, 2019) is a triangular representation based on the fault-slip, which discriminates between strike-slip and dip-slip tectonic patterns. The triangular graph is based on the equal-areal representation of the main axes, T, N or B and P (T: tensile; N or B: neutral; P: pressure axes). This method was originally performed for earthquake focal mechanism solutions by using the focal parameter, nodal plane and rake (Kaverina et al., 1996). P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020) introduced the use of the strain tensor shape combined with the K\u2032-diagram, and divided the diagram in 7 different zones according to the type of fault: (1) pure normal, (2) pure reverse and (3) pure strike-slip, (4) reverse strike-slip, (5) strike-slip with reverse component, (6) normal strike-slip, and (7) strike-slip faults with normal component. Strike-slip faults are defined by small pitch values (p\u00a0<\u00a025\u00b0), with dip close to a vertical plane (\u03b2\u00a0>\u00a075\u00b0). High pitch values (p\u00a0>\u00a060\u00b0) are related to normal or\/reverse fault-slip vectors. Extensional faults show ey in vertical whereas compressional faults show ey in a horizontal plane. The advantage of using this diagram is the direct assignation of the fault type and the tectonic regime, as well as the strain axes relationship. Hence, the K\u2032-diagram classifies the type of fault according to the strain tensor.\n\n\n3.4\nPaleostrain analysis\n\nP\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020) carried out a first approach to the application of the paleostrain analysis in the surroundings of geologic carbon storage (GCS) in Hontom\u00edn (central Spain). They performed the analysis in a 20\u00a0km radius circle, centered in the Hontom\u00edn reservoir. This circle size was estimated taking into account active faulting with the capacity of triggering earthquakes with magnitudes up to M 6, which show a surface rupture of tens of kilometers length (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). Verdon et al. (2015) pointed out that the maximum distance of induced earthquakes for fluid injection is 20\u00a0km, according to the empirical evidence from plotting epicenters and injection wells. Larger distances could not be related to the stress\/strain regime within the reservoir, except for the case of large geological structures affected by static stress changes (folds, master faults, etc.).\nThe presence of master faults (triggering earthquakes of magnitude \u22656) inside the 20\u00a0km radius circle implicates that the regional tectonic stress field determines the strain accumulation into the reservoir. Additionally, the presence of master faults could increase the occurrence of micro-earthquakes, due to the presence of secondary faults prone to trigger earthquakes by their normal seismic cycle (Scholz, 2018).\nTo compare the kinematics results from the analysis of micro fault-slip data with the macro analysis, we have studied the regional earthquake focal mechanism solutions (Giner-Robles et al., 2012). Hence, the fault plane reactivation have been studied by using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion (Pan et al., 2016), from the focal mechanism solutions of regional earthquakes (50\u00a0km around the gas energy storage facilities, www.ign.es, last access June 2021).\nWe have obtained the strain field (ey main direction and K\u2019), from the Right-Dihedral and Slip Model applying fault-slip data (kinematics) and focal mechanism solutions for regional earthquakes. We have used the Win-tensor software (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003) to obtain the stress tensor from the focal mechanism solutions to be compared with the strain results of earthquakes and faults, and the slip-tendency analysis from the Mohr circle.\nIn this work, we assumed that the orientation of the stress axis 2D horizontal projection, SHmax is parallel to the orientation of the strain axes 2D horizontal projection, and for instantaneous strain cases. Hence, ey, the minimum horizontal stress axis, Shmin, is parallel to the minimum horizontal strain axis, ex. This assumption allows us to estimate the plane projection of the stress trajectories (SHmax and Shmin) from the ey SM results.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nA total of 375 kinematic fault-slip data in 24 outcrops were collected within the 20\u00a0km radius circle (results in Fig. 2\n, geographical location in Fig. 3\n.), mainly slickenside lineaments with sense of the movement developed on calcite\/dolomite fault microplanes (cm-sized). Data are summarized in the supplementary material (excel file). The magnetic declination was lesser than 1\u00b0, and we assumed a compass error by field measuring of \u00b15\u00b0. Outcrops with a number of data lesser than 5 measurements have been removed from the analysis since the RD and SD methods are not able to estimate the slip solutions with 4 or less number of data. Stratigraphic ages comprise from Cretaceous, early Miocene, middle Miocene, late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary.\n\n4.1\nStrain Slip Model and right-dihedral\nMost of the outcrops are located on Miocene deposits, mainly limestone, dolomite and marls (Fig. 3a). Two strain fields have been interpreted (Fig. 2, see supplementary material for results: Right Dihedral, Slip Method and K\u2032-diagram). A first strain field is defined by ey with NW-SE trend and two components (Fig. 2): 1a) extensional component defined by normal faults with NW-SE trend, and 1b) compressional component activating strike-slip faults with reverse component, oriented NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE. The second strain field is defined by ey with NE-SW trend and exhibits two components: 2a) extensional component defined by normal faults with NE-SW trend, and 2b) compressional component is only defined by a few ENE-WSW strike-slip faults (n\u00a0=\u00a011, Fig. 2) with reverse component, and N\u2013S faults with reverse component (n\u00a0=\u00a07, Fig. 2).\nA total of 8 outcrops were removed due to the low quality of the data (Fig. 3a, grey names). 6 outcrops are located within the circle of 10\u00a0km of radius, showing the ey with NE-SW trend recorded by late Miocene rocks. (Fig. 3a). 9 outcrops are located within the 20\u00a0km radius circle, ey with NE-SW trend under an extensional strain field with strike-slip component. 114 fault-slip data showed results mechanically compatible with a strain tensor oriented NW-SE (strain field 1a), under an extensional regime and with strike-slip component. 162 fault-slip data are congruent with a strain tensor oriented NE-SW under an extensional regime. 32 fault-slip data have shown a strain tensor with ey with E-W trend under an extensional regime with strike-slip component. 28 fault-slip data defined a strain tensor with ey showing N\u2013S trend.\nThe horizontal strain trajectories (Fig. 3c and d) were plotted by using the software Lissage (Lee and Angelier, 1994). Strain trajectories for field 1 are slightly curved from a N\u2013S to NW-SE trend. These trajectories are perpendicular to the NE-SW thrust (Fig. 3c) bounding the reservoir to the SE. (Fig. 3c), accommodating strain in the structural trap. Secondary horizontal strain trajectories are parallel to the structural trap (Fig. 3d).\n\n\n4.2\nInduced seismicity\nA set of 141 earthquakes were recorded within the 20\u00a0km radius circle around the Yela facilities, since the starting date of Yela operations in 2012 up to 2021 (www.ign.es, last access February 2022, Fig. 3. See supplementary information). Instrumental data recorded before 2012 show four earthquakes (two in 1982 of magnitude M\u00a0=\u00a04.1 and M\u00a0=\u00a02.9, one in 1996 of M\u00a0=\u00a02.8, and other in 2001 with magnitude\u00a0=\u00a02.5). No micro earthquakes (M\u00a0<\u00a02) have been recorded in the zone before the geologic gas storage was operational.\nThe geological natural gas storage facility at Yela is commonly defined in the term of energy storage, using the physical units kWh (to check monthly gas energy storage, see the official web browser at https:\/\/www.enagas.es\/enagas\/es\/Transporte_de_gas\/Almacenamientos_Subterraneos, last access February 2022). Data of gas operations used in this work were obtained from this official web site. To represent volume gas data, we have changed from energy units (kWh) to volume units (m3) applying the following equation:\n\nequation [1]\nEnergy (kWh)\u00a0=\u00a0[vol (m3) * calorific value (MJ\/m3) * 1.02264] \/ 3.6\n\n\n\nThe calorific value of natural gas, the amount of heat produced on combusting a unit volume of gas, usually rages between 37.5 and 43\u00a0MJ\/m3, and depending on the quality of natural gas, it can deviate \u00b15%. 1.02264 is a constant correction factor, and 3.6 is the conversion factor for kWh. However, without more than a 5% loss in accuracy, we assume that 1\u00a0m3 of natural gas corresponds to 10.55\u00a0kWh.\nPlotting the monthly seismic energy (J) released with the injection\/withdrawal gas volume (m3) into the reservoir (Fig. 4\na and b), the injection maximum volume is shown in the summer season, while the gas maximum withdrawal volume in autumn-winter seasons. The gas operations (Fig. 4c) shows a starting point in 2012, related with a cluster of 21 earthquakes with a maximum magnitude of M\u00a0=\u00a02 (see left circle in Fig. 4c). The maximum cluster comprises 43 earthquakes of maximum magnitude of M\u00a0=\u00a02.3, which occurred in October 2017 (Fig. 4). The gas storage worked at his maximum capacity from May 2019 to present day, showing a typical seasonal saw-curve of injection\/withdrawal (Fig. 4c, right grey shadow zone).\nThe gas injection\/withdrawal operation has been increasing from 2012 to July 2021, according to the maximum stored gas into the reservoir (Fig. 4a). We have classified the seismic peaks between the years 2012 and 2021 (Fig. 4c). The first peak (P12a) is related with the starting operations in Yela, in March of 2012, with an earthquake of M\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0at 11\u00a0km depth, although no data about injection\/withdrawal volume are available. The second injection peak of 2012 (P12b, November, Fig. 4b) triggered 13 earthquakes with Mmax\u00a0=\u00a02.1, between November and early December 2012. Most of the earthquake peaks are related to the injection stages, either displaced with a time lag from the annual maximum injection date (see arrows in Fig. 4a), or in coincidence with the month of the maximum injection volume. No relationship between gas withdrawal and earthquake has been established (Fig. 4b).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nStrain\/stress field\n10 focal mechanism solutions were used (Fig. 5\n, Herraiz et al., 2000; Giner-Robles et al., 2012, supplementary material, excel file earthquakes). Most of them are located south of the Yela site related to the basement flexural structure (Giner-Robles et al., 2012) and are in agreement with the regional strain field defined by Herraiz et al. (2000). Reverse earthquakes focal mechanisms reveal a compressive stage in the Madrid Basin.\nThe strain field defined by the ey orientation and obtained from the slip-method and the right-dihedral are in agreement in comparison with the seismic regional strain field obtained from the analysis of the focal mechanism solutions (Fig. 5, ey with NW-SW trend and reverse component). The strain field 1, featured by ey oriented NW-SE, shows an unambiguously similarity to the ey orientation obtained from the focal mechanisms, i.e. N141\u00b0 versus N139\u00b0 respectively. 25 fault-slip data agree with the focal mechanism solutions for a regional compressive strain field. Conversely, the K\u2032-diagram shows that the strain field 1 consists of an extensional tectonic strain field (supplementary material, results-stations.pdf). The strain field 2 is defined by ey N51\u00b0, versus ey N43\u00b0 obtained from earthquake focal mechanisms (Fig. 5). This strain field is also compatible with the regional strain field defined by Herraiz et al. (2000), but with extensional component. In both cases, the kinematics comparison between strain fault-slip data and earthquake focal mechanisms are in agreement from the horizontal axes comparison and tectonic regime. Nevertheless, the fault-slip kinematics suggests a local strain field with similar ey orientation (strain field 1, NW-SE, Fig. 5), but characterized by extension. Moreover, the secondary strain field (2) shows a switch of the strain axes, with ey oriented NE-SW, perpendicular to strain field 1, and with an extensional component. This interchange of axes could be interpreted as the 3D strain field distribution according to the structure folding. Once the anticline affecting Cretaceous carbonates is formed, the fold core experiences compression, while the upper part undergoes extension (see Fig. 21.18 in Ramsay and Huber, 1987). Therefore, we interpret that the local strain field featured by extension is a shallow strain field (probably less than 5\u00a0km deep), where NE-SW and NW-SE faults are reactivated as normal faults. Both fault sets configure a 3D arrangement of extensional structures prone to leak fluid by lateral migration due to overpressure..\nThe stress field obtained from the Delvaux analysis (Fig. 6\n) is defined as a reverse stress field featured by \u03c31 with N136\u00b0 (NW-SE) trend, \u03c33 vertical, and \u03c32 with N41\u00b0 (NE-SW) trend. This result is in agreement with the results obtained from the fault-slip data and the orientation of ey (ranging between N 119\u00b0\u2013141\u00b0, Fig. 2). The result of the dilatation tendency indicates that faults oriented NNE-SSW and NE-SW could be reactivated as reverse faults (Fig. 6). Therefore, there is a coincidence between the ey orientation (strain field), and the \u03c31 orientation (stress field) defined by the focal mechanism solutions from regional earthquakes and the fault-slip data measured in the nearby outcrops. This trend is NW-SE, in agreement with the regional active stress field defined by Herraiz et al. (2000).\n\n\n5.2\nInduced seismicity\nThe first injection gas operation triggered induced seismicity in November 2012 (Fig. 4b, P12a and P12b), probably related to the increasing of the pore pressure. However, the next injection stages in November 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 triggered a few earthquakes not larger than M\u00a0=\u00a02 (occurred in July 2015, event P15, in coincidence with summer injection operation). The accumulated gas in this period was about 4.7 * 106\u00a0m3. During November 2017, the induced seismicity notably increased (Fig. 4b, P17b) with 47 earthquakes and a maximum magnitude of Mmax\u00a0=\u00a02.3. This cluster shows up when the total stored gas volume reaches approximately 7.6 * 108\u00a0m3 (Fig. 4b). From 2017 to June 2021, two decreasing seismic peaks (magnitude and energy, P19, P20) were detected in November 2019 and 2020. Both peaks coincide with the accumulated underground energy (Fig. 4b), related with the injection\/withdrawal balance (remaining stored gas, injected gas minus withdrawn gas). Our results suggest that small induced seismic peaks appear (P12, P14, P17b, P19, P20, Fig. 4) due to winter operations (between November and February). To reinforce this, we have applied a cross correlation analysis between the injection data and earthquake occurrence (see supplementary material, correlation.pdf). Both time series reveal stationarity and the correlation shows a lag of 3 months between the injection and the earthquake occurrence, which takes place at the end of the injection operations. Therefore, we interpret that micro-earthquakes are triggered when the maximum reservoir pore pressure is reached at the end of the injection operations. Delayed triggering of induced earthquake is nowadays a matter of discussion (e.g. Pe\u00f1a-Castro et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2022; Lasocki et al., 2022). The study of this delay time is far beyond the objective of this work.\nOn the other hand, the depth distribution of the induced earthquake hypocentres (20\u00a0km away from Yela) shows a maximum between 3 and 6\u00a0km (Fig. 7\n). Three of the regional earthquakes (50\u00a0km away of Yela) are located at 2\u00a0km depth (plus error bar, see the vertical red line in Fig. 7), which are defined as reverse earthquakes with strike-slip component (Giner-Robles et al., 2012). This suggests that the Yela reservoir (2,300\u00a0m depth) is affected by the regional reverse strain field. Therefore, reverse earthquakes could be affecting the reservoir, along with normal earthquakes related to the local extensional strain field. The sense of relaxation during the local seismic event is a function of the orientation and the resolved stress along such failure planes.\nRegarding the potential induced maximum earthquake magnitude, we have applied the McGarr empirical equation (McGarr, 2014, equation 13):\n\nEquation [2]\nM0max\u00a0=\u00a0G*\u0394V\n\nWhere M0max is the maximum seismic moment, \u0394V is the injected gas, and G is the modulus of rigidity and normally used\u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0GPa. In Yela, the maximum volume of stored gas was estimated around 1.14 * 109\u00a0m3 of gas volume (see https:\/\/www.enagas.es\/stfls\/EnagasImport\/Ficheros\/513\/97\/Folleto%20Yela%20-%20Ingl%C3%A9s.pdf last access August 2021), corresponding to 1.2 * 1010\u00a0kWh of energy storage. Besides, future induced seismicity clusters could be related with a rapid daily flow injection, instead of the total stored volume. According to the technical disposals of the Yela, the maximum gas flow per day is 15 * 106\u00a0m3\/day (1.75 * 108\u00a0kWh of officially energy storage).\nApplying the McGarr's equation (cushion gas not included), the result is a seismic energy (E) of 1.71 *1015\u00a0J, which is as minimum magnitude as of M 6.5 (log E\u00a0=\u00a05.24\u00a0+\u00a01.44 * M). However, the magnitude obtained from the application of the McGarr's equation is based on the assumption that all of the strain induced by injecting a fluid is released as a seismic-sourced. However, the reservoir permeability allows accommodating the fluid injection with a small variation of the pore pressure, showing creep deformation and heat conductivity. Accordingly, induced earthquakes magnitudes use to be lower than the maximum magnitude obtained from McGarr's equation, which has to be considered as an extreme theoretical approach, rather than the expected earthquake magnitude.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe regional strain field in the Yela geologic gas storage (central Spain) is defined by a compressive regime with ey horizontal shortening trending NW-SE. The regional stress field obtained from the Delvaux fault-slip analysis is reverse and defined by \u03c31 with NW-SE trend. According to the Slip-Tendency analysis, NE-SW and NNE-SSW oriented fault planes can be reactivated as reverse faults with a strike-slip component. Shallow reverse earthquakes (2\u00a0km depth) could occur into the reservoir, as suggested by the regional and local strain and stress fields.\nThe local strain field shows two extensional solutions defined by ey NW-SE (strain field 1) and ey NE-SW trend (strain field 2). These local strain induced the reactivation of faults oriented NW-SE as normal faults and N\u2013S faults as strike-slip faults. Lateral underground gas leakage would be determined by normal NW-SE faults, and N\u2013S\/E-W strike-slip faults with an extensional component.\nInduced seismicity related to Yela operations was recorded in the time period comprised between 2012 and 2021. Initially, a seismic cluster was related to the starting injection operations. Then, different seasonally seismic peaks were identified in summer operations, during the injection phase, but it decreases in frequency and earthquake magnitude year by year. A time lag of 3 months has been determined from cross correlation analysis. A seismic cluster with 47 earthquakes and with a Mmax\u00a0=\u00a02.3 took place during the summer-autumn operations of 2017. Ongoing summer operations of injection triggered small clusters of induced seismicity in autumn\/winter, although the recorded induced earthquake activities have decreased in frequency and magnitude over the last period from 2017 to 2021. However, there is no model to explain this fact despite the relationship between injection gas and earthquake occurrence is positive. Since Yela is working at the maximum stored gas volume (1.1 * 109\u00a0m3) at present day, future relevant and potentially felt earthquake clusters of induced seismicity could be related to the rapid daily injection gas of the reservoir instead of the maximum volume storage.\n\n","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe seminal paper by Ramsay and Graham (1970) has formalised the concept of localised shear zone as a tabular-shaped zone of high strain. The shear zone they described is typically characterized by the occurrence of a strain-induced foliation with a sigmoidal-shaped geometry reflecting the symmetric decrease of strain from the centre to the boundary of the shear zone (Fig. 1\na and b). The inferences of Ramsay and Graham about ductility and strain softening processes controlling shear zone development (\u201d[\u2026] the structure in them appear to have been produced by ductile flow of the rock within the zone. [\u2026] Why then should the deformation become localized in these narrow zones? Perhaps it is because the initially deforming material became \u201cstrain softened\u201d so that it acquired a progressively decreasing yield strength or higher ductility as the progress of deformation led to changes in its internal fabric.\u201d) have inspired researchers for many years afterwards. Ramsay (1980) linked quantitatively the geometry of shear zones (quantified by \u03b8\u2032, which represents the angle of the foliation with respect to the shear plane \u2013 corresponding to the orientation of the principal extensional train axis of the strain ellipsoid) to the amount of shear strain \u03b3, through the equation (Fig. 1c):\n\n\n\ntan\n\n2\n\n\u03b8\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\n2\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis equation effectively served as a pivotal link between data from field analyses, microstructural observations, experimental rock deformation and numerical and analytical modelling. Therefore, this quantitative approach laid the foundations for the multidisciplinary analysis of strain localisation processes at the meso-to micro-scale, leading to the development of the modern concept of (ductile) shear zone (Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017).\nRamsay developed important concepts on shear zone formation from field analysis of small-scale shear zones of cm-dm thickness within the meta-granitoid Maggia nappe (Central Alps, Fig. 1a) and the gabbroic rocks of Castell Odair (North Uist) (Ramsay and Graham, 1970). Indeed, meta-granitoid units and granitoid plutons represent ideal natural laboratories for investigations of strain localisation within macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic rocks, providing spectacular field exposures of shear zones and (incipient) shear zone networks (e.g., Ramsay and Allison, 1979; Ingles et al., 1999; Pennacchioni, 2005; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007; Pennacchioni and Zucchi, 2013; Ceccato and Pennacchioni, 2018).\nIn this paper, we report the recent advancements on the understanding of the microstructural processes controlling the nucleation and development of small-scale ductile shear zones in granitoid rocks. Such small-scale shear zones preferentially develop at retrograde metamorphic conditions at the transition between amphibolite to greenschist facies. However, small-scale shear zones similar to those described in the Maggia nappe have been also reported from different rock types and metamorphic conditions (e.g. granulite and eclogite facies in granitoid and gabbroic rocks: Van Roermund et al., 1979; Austrheim, 1987; Pennacchioni, 1996; Getsinger et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2015; Macente et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2022). Field analysis has highlighted the role of precursor brittle structures and compositional heterogeneities in controlling ductile strain localisation (Segall and Simpson, 1986; B\u00fcrgmann and Pollard, 1994; Christiansen and Pollard, 1997; Guermani and Pennacchioni, 1998; Pennacchioni, 2005; Fusseis et al., 2006; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007, 2018; Schrank et al., 2008b, Pennacchioni and Zucchi, 2013). Recent analytical and modelling advancements have provided new (semi-)quantitative insights on the role of microstructural and metamorphic processes in controlling the evolution of both the internal fabric and the yield strength of the deforming rock (e.g., Smith et al., 2015; Gardner et al., 2017; Meyer et al., 2016). In particular, the systematic investigation of deformation microstructures with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and quantitative image analysis has allowed to constrain the microstructural and crystallographic signatures of specific deformation mechanisms and metamorphic reactions controlling strain accommodation (Menegon et al., 2008a,b; Pennacchioni et al., 2010; Kilian et al., 2011; Oliot et al., 2014; Spruzeniece and Piazolo, 2015; Ceccato et al., 2017, 2018; Gilgannon et al., 2017). Similarly, micro-analytical techniques (electron probe micro analyser \u2013 EPMA, cathodoluminescence \u2013 CL, secondary ion mass spectrometer \u2013 SIMS, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy \u2013 FTIR; micro-computerized tomography \u2013 \u03bcCT) coupled to petrological modelling (phase diagram section calculation, geothermobarometry) allowed the role of reaction processes and fluids (mainly H2O) in controlling the rheology and microstructural evolution to be identified (Kronenberg and Wolf, 1990; Oliot et al., 2010; Goncalves et al., 2012; Bestmann and Pennacchioni, 2015; Finch et al., 2016; Macente et al., 2017; Ceccato et al., 2020, 2022; Kronenberg et al., 2020). In addition, numerical and analytical models allowed to test inferences retrieved from field and microstructural analyses and to quantify the effect of deformation-metamorphism-metasomatism feedback processes on the geometry and rheology of shear zones (Mancktelow, 2002; Shrank et al., 2008; Huet et al., 2014; Ceccato et al., 2018; Kaatz et al., 2021). These new insights questioned existing models of purely strain-driven shear zone development (Ramsay and Graham, 1970; Ramsay, 1980; Lamouroux et al., 1994; Means, 1995). Indeed, recent studies have highlighted the role of both inherited and dynamically evolving (strain-dependent) gradients of fluid-rock interactions in controlling shear zone nucleation and development (Oliot et al., 2014; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018; Kaatz et al., 2021).\nIn this paper, starting from the concepts developed by John Ramsay and co-authors in the 1970\u2019, we provide a brief overview and an integrated critical discussion of the improvements that innovative approaches have brought to our understanding of the mesostructural, microstructural and petrological processes controlling the development of small-scale shear zones in granitoid rocks. This work aims to complement and expand the review work of Pennacchioni and Mancktelow (2018) on small-scale shear zones developed in granitoid rocks. For what regards the development of multiscale shear zones in general, the reader is addressed to more comprehensive and extensive reviews (e.g., Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017). Finally, we highlight several topics that still require further research efforts and provide some hints for further research development.\n\n\n2\nField analyses of the meso-scale geometry of shear zones in granitoid rocks\nThe geometrical model of the ductile shear zone proposed by Ramsay and Graham (1970) allows to quantify the amount of shear strain accommodated across a shear zone from the deformation geometry (Fig. 1c). The model was based on the field analysis of small-scale (cm-dm thick) ductile shear zones developed within isotropic, homogeneous rocks (Fig. 1a). In addition, it formalized the occurrence of \u201cstrain markers\u201d in shear zones, such as the inclined sigmoidal foliation, the gradual deflection of crosscutting geological structures (e.g., dykes) and passive distortion of initially subrounded, suitably sized objects (Ramsay and Allison, 1979; Ramsay, 1980). In particular, the quantitative geometrical description and recognition of strain markers allowed the acknowledgement and quantification of the dominant role of a simple shear component of deformation, over pure shear, during the development of ductile shear zones (Ramsay and Graham, 1970; Ramsay, 1980). Since then, the analysis of the field geometry of small-scale shear zones and meso-scale networks led to significant improvement in our understanding of, as well as opened new debates on: (1) the process of shear zone nucleation; (2) the strain history recorded with increasing displacement; (3) the propagation and networking of shear zones.\n\n2.1\nNucleation and geometry of incipient shear zones\nContrasting models on shear zone nucleation have been proposed. Based on theoretical, experimental, microstructural and numerical studies, shear zones nucleate \u201cspontaneously\u201d as the result of either thermal softening at large (km) scale (Fleitout and Froidevaux, 1980; Regenauer-Lieb and Yuen, 2003; Duretz et al., 2014; Kiss et al., 2019), or the interconnection of zones of concentrated high strain caused by micro-scale, point-like flaws in an otherwise isotropic, homogeneous medium (Ingles et al., 1999; Mancktelow, 2002; Holyoke and Tullis, 2006; Meyer et al., 2016). In contrast, field observations on granitoid rocks provide increasing evidence for the necessary occurrence of a tabular, meso-scale precursor structure (either a brittle fracture or a compositional\/structural heterogeneity) to allow a shear zone to nucleate (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2013; Wehrens et al., 2017; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018, and reference therein). It is worth noting that brittle fractures can be sometimes associated with pseudotachylytes (frictional melt produced by seismic slip along faults in silicate rocks: Sibson, 1975), which are then exploited as precursors to small-scale ductile shear zones in granitoids (e.g., Passchier, 1982; Takagi et al., 2000; Sullivan et al., 2013).\nFurthermore, field observations suggest the likely occurrence of a threshold dimension of the precursor structures at the meter to tens of meters scale, below which precursor structures are not exploited as site for ductile strain localisation in meta-granitoids (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2013) as well as in foliated metamorphic rocks (Fusseis and Handy, 2008). The geometry of the precursor has a two-fold effect on the finite strain geometry of the shear zone (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2005; Pennacchioni, 2005): (i) it determines the spatial extent (length) of the finite shear zone, and (ii) it controls the geometry (thickness, continuous vs. discontinuous) of the finite strain gradient. These observations have had important implications for the understanding of the processes controlling the growth of shear zones in both thickness and length, as well as networking, during strain accommodation.\n\n\n2.2\nFinite strain gradients and shear zone history\nThe symmetric, continuous decrease of shear strain from the core to the boundary represented by the sigmoidal foliation was interpreted to reflect the evolution through time and space of the rheology during strain localisation at constant temperature and pressure conditions (Ramsay and Graham, 1970; Schrank et al., 2008a,b). This interpretation has led previous authors to the formulation of some idealised models of shear zone, either narrowing or thickening with increasingly accommodated displacement (Type I-II-III-IV) (Hull, 1988; Means, 1995; Schrank et al., 2008b; Vitale and Mazzoli, 2008; see Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017 for a detailed discussion of such models). Such models generally include three different classes of shear zones (e.g., Means, 1995): (i) thickening shear zones in which the width increases with increasing displacement, usually related to strain-hardening rheology within the shear zone; (ii) narrowing shear zones in which the width decreases with increasing displacement, usually related to the occurrence of strain-softening rheology within the shear zone; (iii) constant-width shear zones in which the width remains constant with increasing displacement. However, so far, no systematic and general relationship between accommodated displacement and thickness of ductile shear zone has been found (e.g., Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017). The datasets of thickness-displacement data are scattered and mainly limited to the small-scale (\u226410\u00a0m thick). These scattered data generally describe a not-better-defined trend of thickening with increasing accommodated displacement (Fig. 2\n; Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017). However, the concept itself of shear zones thickening contrasts with the concept of strain localisation within the shear zone, which would rather promote shear zone narrowing (Ramsay and Graham, 1970; Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018).\nIn some cases, the finite thickness and the discontinuous\/continuous character of the finite strain gradient might reflect the geometry of the compositional and rheological heterogeneity on which the shear zone nucleated (Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2005; Schrank et al., 2008b; Spruzeniece and Piazolo, 2015; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018; Kaatz et al., 2021). This interpretation is supported by thickness vs. displacement data retrieved from detailed field mapping, showing no systematic trends in shear zone thickness variation with (small, <1\u201310\u00a0m) displacement (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018). At larger (m to tens of meter) widths, and at larger shear strains, strain gradients around shear zones are commonly associated with an effective gradient in fluid-rock interaction and mass transfer (Marquer et al., 1985; Fourcade et al., 1989; Tobisch et al., 1991; Fr\u00fch-Green, 1994; Barnes et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2004; Oliot et al., 2014; Finch et al., 2016; Kaatz et al., 2021). These multiscale observations suggest that the analysis of the development and the role of such fluid gradients may be key to improve our understanding of the evolution of shear zone thickness during shearing. Indeed, recent models inspired by detailed field observation consider fluid expulsion related to chemo-mechanical pressure gradients induced by rheological and chemical contrasts during shear zone development (e.g., Oliot et al., 2014; Finch et al., 2016). These models nicely reproduce the pattern of shear zone evolution and networking inferred from field observations of multiscale shear zone networks in crystalline rocks in general (e.g., Kaatz et al., 2021). Therefore, even though widely accepted and adopted to interpret shear zones geometry and rheology, the standard classification of thickening-narrowing-constant thickness shear zones might oversimplify the complex (and possibly cyclical) thickening-narrowing and rheological history recorded in shear zones during displacement accommodation (e.g., Steffen et al., 2001; Schrank et al., 2008b).\n\n\n2.3\nInsights into shear zone growth and networking\nGranitoid rocks commonly display well-exposed outcrops of multi-scale shear zone networks, presenting shear zones ranging from 10\u22124\u00a0m\u2013105\u00a0m in length (Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017). Despite the overall agreement on the theoretical process of formation of interconnected shear zone network through the coalescence of single, isolated shear zones, the geologic process controlling linkage and actual coalescence remains matter of debate (Carreras et al., 2010; Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017). A network of pre-existing compositional and structural heterogeneities within an otherwise homogeneous granitoid rock could provide the seed on which a shear zone network develops, controlling the incipient stages of shear zone formation and networking (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007). However, the mechanisms controlling the formation of large scale, complex networks formed by shear zones of different width and length remains matter of debate.\nEspecially when shear zones nucleate from brittle precursors, contrasting models have been proposed to explain the transition from isolated, small-scale shears to meso-scale interconnected networks (Fusseis et al., 2006; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007; Fusseis and Handy, 2008; Schrank et al., 2008). Detailed field mapping of incipient meso-scale networks in meta-granitoids has shown that, at least for small values of accommodated shear strain, the shear zone length is limited to the length of the precursor structure. In the latter case, the shear zone did not appear to extend in length with increasingly accommodated strain, as it has been inferred from the preservation of contractional jogs at the tip of sheared precursor structures (Pennacchioni, 2005; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007; Pennacchioni and Zucchi, 2013). On the other hand, based on microstructural and meso-scale observations in foliated meta-pelites of Cap de Creus, Fusseis et al. (2006) proposed that small-scale shear zones can grow laterally following the synchronous propagation of the migrating brittle precursor tip parallel to the shear plane in the shear direction. Reaction-induced softening of the host rock around the shear zones, triggered by fluid infiltration during shearing, may provide another feasible way to extend and widen single shears which will invariably connect into a complex network with increasing strain (e.g., Oliot et al., 2014; Kaatz et al., 2021). Therefore, several processes might be responsible for shear zone networking, and both metamorphic, ductile and brittle-ductile processes need to be considered to understand the processes of shear zone growth in time and space (e.g., Schrank et al., 2008b; Nevitt et al., 2014; Nevitt and Pollard, 2017; Nardini et al., 2018; D\u00f6hmann et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n3\nPetrological constraints on shear zone development in granitoid rocks\nShear zones are the loci of numerous interactions between deformation, metamorphism and fluid flow. For instance, the development of shear zones in granitoid rocks is concomitant with mineralogical changes that, in most cases, favour strain softening and localisation (McCaig, 1984; Gueydan et al., 2003; Holyoke and Tullis, 2006). In turn, deformation enhances metamorphic reactions either by overcoming kinetic barriers or by favouring the development of permeability and fluid infiltration (Fusseis et al., 2009; Oliot et al., 2014). Understanding the feedbacks between all these interdependent processes is critical to better model strain localisation.\nIn general, metamorphic reactions may be driven by: (i) change in pressure (P)-temperature (T) conditions, (ii) change in fluid content and composition (fl), (iii) change in bulk chemistry (X) due to mass transfer (i.e. metasomatism). During deformation of a granitoid rock, it is very likely that the magmatic assemblage is metastable at the P-T-fl-X conditions of the deformation (Goncalves et al., 2012). In this case, metamorphic and metasomatic reactions are also driven by (iv) disequilibrium and the equilibration of the metastable magmatic assemblage at the P-T-fl-X conditions of the deformation (Goncalves et al., 2012). In the following section, we review phase relations of granitoid rocks as a function of P-T-fl-X conditions and discuss their influence on strain localisation and shear zone development through the analysis of P-T, T-M\n\nH2O\n and T-X phase diagram sections. Phase diagrams were computed with Perple_X 6.9.1 (Connolly, 2005) for the bulk composition of an average meta-granodiorite from the Neves Lake area (e.g., Leydier et al., 2019), using the thermodynamic database of (Holland and Powell, 2011; TC-DS62) and the a-X solid solution models of White et al. (2014). The chemical system includes K2O\u2013FeO\u2013MgO\u2013Al2O3\u2013SiO2\u2013H2O (KFMASH). MnO, TiO2 and Fe2O3 are not considered here. Mineral abbreviations are from Whitney and Evans (2010).\n\n3.1\nP-T conditions of shear zones in meta-granitoids and granitoid plutons\nSince the description of small-scale shear zones in the meta-granitoid unit of the Maggia Nappe of Ramsay and Graham (1970), many other occurrences of similar small-scale shear zones were reported from the crystalline basements and granitoid plutons of the Alps and other localities worldwide (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018, and reference therein). Despite the different tectonic and metamorphic history of (Alpine) meta-granitoid and magmatic plutons, all the reported cases of small-scale shear zones developed between 350\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, during cooling of the pluton or during the retrograde P-T path of the meta-granitoid unit (Fig. 3\na). In detail, shear zone nucleation and development in meta-granitoid units occurred mainly at P\u00a0>\u00a00.4\u00a0GPa and T\u00a0=\u00a0420\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C (light blue areas in Fig. 3a). In granitoid plutons, emplaced at middle and upper crustal levels, shear zone nucleation occurred at P\u00a0<\u00a00.5\u00a0GPa and T\u00a0=\u00a0350\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C (pale orange areas in Fig. 3a), similarly to what was already reported by Gapais (1989). Overall, these data show that small-scale shear zones in meta-granitoids preferentially develop in a restricted T window at the transition between amphibolite and greenschist facies. The main differences between shear zones developed in meta-granitoid units and those from cooling granitoid plutons probably reside in (i) the timescale of deformation (much shorter for cooling plutons) and (ii) fluid (mainly H2O) availability, which has enormous effects for the rheology, metamorphic processes and longevity of shear zones (see sections below).\n\n\n3.2\nP-T phase relations of granitoid systems under H2O-saturated conditions\nWe explore, through phase relation modelling, the main mineralogical changes expected at the conditions of shear zone development as defined above. Fig. 3b and c shows the P-T phase diagram sections computed for the KFMASH system, which is suitable to model the main phase relations in granitoid systems. Here, we firstly consider phase relations calculated at H2O-saturated conditions for the sake of simplicity, and then we discuss the effect of H2O-undersaturation on phase relations in granitoid rocks in the next Sections (see below). Fig. 3b shows that from ca. 700\u00a0\u00b0C (i.e. the temperature of the hydrated solidus) to about 550\u00a0\u00b0C and a pressure from 0.1 to 0.8\u00a0GPa, there is a large multivariant field that consists of Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Bt\u00a0+\u00a0Qz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Amp\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Kfs corresponding to the expected magmatic assemblage for a granodiorite. During cooling of a pluton or a retrograde path, there are no major mineralogical changes from 700 to 550\u00a0\u00b0C. In contrast, between 450 and 500\u00a0\u00b0C, the phase diagram shows several phase boundaries that are mostly related to a main univariant reaction (1) in the KFMASH system:\n\n(1)\nPl\u00a0+\u00a0Kfs\u00a0+\u00a0Bt\u00a0+\u00a0Qz\u00a0+\u00a0H2O\u00a0=\u00a0Ms\u00a0+\u00a0Chl\u00a0+\u00a0Ab\u00a0+\u00a0Ep\n\n\n\nthat separates amphibolite and greenschist facies. For the average granodiorite bulk composition, there are four divariant reactions associated with reaction (1). Among them, we discuss two divariant reactions located at pressure above 0.5\u00a0GPa that account for the main mineralogical changes observed in granitoid shear zones:\n\nKfs\u00a0+\u00a0Bt\u00a0+\u00a0Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz\u00a0+\u00a0H2O\u00a0=\u00a0Ab\u00a0+\u00a0Ep\u00a0+\u00a0Ms (Chl)\n\n\n\n\nPl\u00a0+\u00a0Bt\u00a0+\u00a0Qz\u00a0+\u00a0H2O\u00a0=\u00a0Ms\u00a0+\u00a0Chl\u00a0+\u00a0Ep (Kf)\n\n\n\nThese two divariant reactions occur in a narrow temperature window, between 450\u00a0\u00b0C and 500\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3c), and they can be linked with classic petrological observations made in shear zones: (a) the saussuritisation of magmatic plagioclase into a fine grained assemblage consisting of albite, epidote and muscovite (e.g. (Fitz Gerald and St\u00fcnitz, 1993; St\u00fcnitz and Fitz Gerald, 1993; Oliot et al., 2010; Goncalves et al., 2012; Menegon et al., 2008a), (b) the breakdown of K-feldspar to produce muscovite (Hippertt, 1998; Gueydan et al., 2003; Tschegg and Grasemann, 2009); and (c) the formation of muscovite and chlorite at the expense of biotite (Goncalves et al., 2012; Airaghi et al., 2020). Additionally, myrmekite formation at the expense of K-feldspar is another commonly reported reaction which contributes to the development of shear zones in granitoid rocks in this temperature window (Tsurumi et al., 2003; Menegon et al., 2006; Ceccato et al., 2018; Cisneros-Lazaro et al., 2019).\nTo conclude, the breakdown of the magmatic load-bearing framework (LBF; Handy, 1990) of Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Kfs (almost \u223c85% of the rock volume) into a fine-grained assemblage consisting of Ab\u00a0+\u00a0Ms\u00a0+\u00a0Ep\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Chl is a first order softening mechanism that may favour strain localisation. Thus, in granitoid rock, the 450\u2013500\u00a0\u00b0C temperature range corresponds to the most favourable conditions for the initiation of reactions promoting strain localisation. The identified temperatures provide the maximum temperatures at which such reactions may occur. Any occurrence of strain localisation and shear zone formation below these temperatures might be effectively controlled by the same parageneses.\n\n\n3.3\nFluid (H2O) saturation and mineralogical effects\nIn the previous section, the phase relations have been investigated assuming H2O-saturated conditions during deformation. However, H2O-saturation might not even be the case or persist during the whole history of shear zone development, as it has been suggested by several recent studies (Finch et al., 2016; Ceccato et al., 2020; Menegon and Fagereng, 2021). Thus, we investigate here the role of H2O content, and more particularly H2O undersaturation on phase relations. Fig. 3d is a T-M\n\nH2O\n phase diagram computed at a constant pressure of 0.6\u00a0GPa. The black dashed curve traces the boundary between H2O-saturated (to the right) and H2O-undersaturated (to the left) phase assemblages. The T-M\n\nH2O\n diagram shows that the meta-granodiorite composition is rather sensitive to very little changes in M\n\nH2O\n at undersaturated conditions. Indeed, M\n\nH2O\n varies overall from 1.2 to 6\u00a0mol (0.33\u20131.63\u00a0wt%). Conversely, at H2O-saturated conditions, the mineral assemblage is mainly dependent on the temperature. During deformation and cooling from 550 to 400\u00a0\u00b0C, the amount of H2O in mol per kilogram of rock must increase by more than 160% to keep the assemblage H2O-saturated. The main mineralogical effects of H2O-undersaturation are (1) the stabilization of garnet, (2) the increase of plagioclase stability to lower temperature (485\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C) and (3) the breakdown of chlorite. Under closed-system conditions (no gain and loss of H2O), cooling from 550\u00a0\u00b0C and deformation would result in the formation of garnet-bearing, at intermediate degrees of under-saturation, or even kyanite bearing shear zones for very low (geologically unrealistic) H2O contents and low temperature (M\n\nH2O\n\u00a0<\u00a00.12\u00a0mol, T\u00a0<\u00a0425\u00a0\u00b0C). The stabilization of garnet and kyanite may be due also to bulk composition effects (abundant MnO and Fe2O3 for garnet), or extensive mass-transfer at fluid-saturated conditions (e.g., kyanite-bearing, granitoid-derived micaschists reported by Sassier et al., 2006). Nonetheless, the occurrence of such index minerals could suggest shear zone formation at H2O under-saturated conditions. At intermediate stages of H2O-undersaturation, i.e. in which a fluid is available but not enough to result in H2O as a free-fluid phase, metamorphic parageneses containing progressively more proportions (in terms of both modal quantity and number of different phases) of hydrated minerals will be stabilised. Then, after H2O saturation, the availability of H2O as a free-fluid phase has enormous effects on the kinetics of metamorphic reactions (having H2O as limiting reactant) and fluid-assisted deformation processes (e.g., dissolution-precipitation and mass transfer, e.g., Yardley and Valley, 1997; Wintsch and Yi, 2002; Ceccato et al., 2020; Tursi, 2022). Therefore, H2O-saturation conditions directly affects the bulk rheology, and need to be investigated in detail for a thorough understanding of shear zone formation and evolution.\n\n\n3.4\nFluid conditions during shear zone development\nH2O-saturation conditions, and thus the occurrence of a free-fluid phase, may be affected by several parameters of the geological setting in which granitoid shear zones develop. Indeed, initial fluid availability, the supply rate from any (either internal or external) fluid source, the retrograde cooling rate of the (meta-)granitoid and the occurrence of retrograde hydration metamorphic reactions may determine the fluid-saturated vs. -undersaturated conditions of the system regardless of the \u201copen vs. closed\u201d conditions of the system with respect to fluid flow (e.g., Yardley, 1981).\nA variable fluid behaviour during shear zone development can be inferred from field, microstructural and petrological evidence. When small scale shear zone in granitoid rocks exploit precursor structures, common precursors are: (i) mineralized joints; (ii) veins; (iii) alteration haloes due to fluid-rock interaction along the selvages of brittle fractures and veins (e.g., Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2005; Pennacchioni, 2005). This set of precursor types involves the occurrence of (mineralising) fluids during at least the formation of the precursors, and thus, local fluid-saturated conditions. Many case studies report that, during precursor formation, the fluid is likely to be of local origin and the granitoid rock behaves as a closed system (e.g., Cesare et al., 2001; Pennacchioni, 2005; Mittempergher et al., 2014; Leydier et al., 2019; Ceccato et al., 2020). After precursor nucleation, phase diagram section calculations have shown that incipient shearing on small-scale shear zones may occur at both fluid-saturated (e.g., in meta-granitoid rocks of the Neves Lake area, Leydier et al., 2019) and fluid-undersaturated conditions (e.g., shear zones from the Adamello, Rieserferner and Sierra Nevada granitoid plutons, Ceccato et al., 2020). In addition, isotopic and major element chemical analyses suggest that, at least within granitoid plutons, the incipient stages of shearing as well might occur at closed system conditions (Pennacchioni, 2005; Mittempergher et al., 2014). At larger-scale, (m to tens of m in width) shear zones in meta-granitoid rocks deform under fluid-saturated, open-system conditions, commonly accompanied by significant mass transfer (e.g., Marquer et al., 1985; Fourcade et al., 1989; McCaig et al., 1990; Fr\u00fch-Green, 1994; Barnes et al., 2004; Rossi et al., 2005; Goncalves et al., 2012; Oliot et al., 2014; Rolland and Rossi, 2016; Wehrens et al., 2017). At such large scale, given the paucity of connate fluids in (meta-)granitoid rocks, an external fluid source is needed, as it is commonly reported for other large-scale, retrograde orogenic shear zones (e.g., Kuckaus shear zone, Diener et al., 2016). As already proposed by Fourcade et al. (1989), the development of a network of shear zones \u201cwell-interconnected\u201d among them, and connected to an external fluid source, likely promote fluid-flow, open system conditions and significant mass-transfer (see below; e.g., Oliot et al., 2014). However, this topic deserves further investigations and research.\n\n\n3.5\nMass transfer and metasomatism in shear zones\nShear zones developed under fluid-saturated conditions are also likely affected by mass transfer either via diffusion or infiltration metasomatism (Korzhiniskii, 1970). Metasomatic reactions result in mineral assemblages that differ significantly from those formed where the system is either open or closed to only H2O transfer. Mass transfer (i.e., metasomatism) has been reported and quantified in many granitoid shear zones (e.g., Goncalves et al., 2012 and reference therein). Although each shear zone should be treated as a unique case (e.g., Tursi et al., 2018), granitoid shear zones developed under greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions show very consistent mass transfer with, in general, a gain in MgO and H2O coupled with a loss of Na2O and CaO (Goncalves et al., 2012). It is beyond the scope of this contribution to explain this coupling, but we explore via phase relation modelling the effect of this specific mass transfer on the mineralogical composition of granitoid shear zones. Based on the literature review, we propose a hypothetical mass transfer scenario, with only four mobile components: gain of H2O and MgO coupled with the loss of CaO and Na2O. Mass transfer evolves linearly from the protolith composition to a metasomatic shear zone characterized by +200% for MgO and \u2212100% and \u221275% for Na2O and CaO respectively. The amount of H2O is computed such that the system is kept H2O saturated. The phase diagram is computed at 0.6\u00a0GPa.\nThe change in bulk composition induced by mass transfer has no effects on the absolute P-T position of the (Chl) and (Kf) reactions (Fig. 4\na). At 0.6\u00a0GPa, these reactions are located at 480\u2013485\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 4a). Under closed system conditions (X\u00a0=\u00a00, Fig. 4b), no major mineralogical changes occur before reaching the (Chl) and (Kf) reactions. At 485-480\u00a0\u00b0C, 65\u00a0vol% of the rock (Pl and Kfs) is recrystallized into fine-grained aggregates of Ab\u00a0+\u00a0Ep (\u223c55%)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0phyllosilicates (Bt\u00a0+\u00a0Ms, \u223c20%). Fig. 4a\u2013c shows the effect of mass transfer at a temperature of 475\u00a0\u00b0C just below the onset of shear zone development. Progressive mass transfer induces a continuous breakdown of Ab\u00a0+\u00a0Ep to produce large amounts of Ms\u00a0+\u00a0Chl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz, (Fig. 4c). In a strongly metasomatized system (X\u00a0=\u00a01), the resulting rock in the shear zone would be a phyllonite consisting of 50% of Qz and 50% of Ms\u00a0+\u00a0Chl (Fig. 4c).\nTherefore, the main result of mass transfer and metasomatic reactions in shear zones is the progressive replacement of the protolith feldspars building up the LBF (Handy, 1990). This results in softening of the deforming shear zone (Gueydan et al., 2003; Oliot et al., 2014). The formation of fine-grained aggregates of Ab\u00a0+\u00a0Ep at intermediate degrees of metasomatism first, and then the stabilization of large amounts of phyllosilicates (Bt\u00a0+\u00a0Ms\u00a0+\u00a0Chl) at advanced stages, have enormous effects on the rheology and fabric development of shear zones, leading to progressive softening and foliation development.\n\n\n\n4\nShear zone microstructure and rheology\nThe \u201cstrain softening mechanisms\u201d proposed by Ramsay and Graham (1970) involve the modification of the spatial arrangement, geometrical characters, chemical composition and phase proportions of the mineral constituents at the micro-to meso-scale (e.g., Poirier, 1980; White et al., 1980).\n\n4.1\nMicrostructural processes and rheological effects\nAt the temperature conditions at which small-scale shear zones are inferred to nucleate and develop (350\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C), strain accommodation and the development of the shear zone fabric involve grain-size reduction (GSR) of mineral phases (Ramsay and Allison, 1979). GSR in quartz is mainly accommodated by dynamic recrystallisation (Stipp et al., 2002; Bestmann and Pennacchioni, 2015); whereas feldspars undergo predominantly brittle GSR (Ree et al., 2005; Viegas et al., 2016) in addition to the retrograde metamorphic reactions described above (Fig. 5\na and b). The contribution of dynamic recrystallisation to GSR in feldspars is negligible in the temperature range considered here (Gapais, 1989, Fitz Gerald and St\u00fcnitz, 1993; Menegon et al., 2008b).\nAssociated with GSR processes, especially when local mass-transfer is involved, phase mixing (PM) may result from neo-crystallisation and phase nucleation related to metamorphic reactions or to the emergence of synkinematic porosity (Fusseis et al., 2009; Kilian et al., 2011; Menegon et al., 2015; Ceccato et al., 2018; Gilgannon et al., 2020, 2021) (Fig. 5a and b). The main result of GSR and PM processes consists in the formation of fine-grained, mixed polyphase aggregates characterised by a rheology (i.e., deformation mechanisms) \u201cweaker\u201d than that of the parent mineral phases (Kilian et al., 2011; Platt and Behr, 2011a,b; Sullivan et al., 2013; Wehrens et al., 2016; Mansard et al., 2018; Stenvall et al., 2019). Indeed, fine-grained, polyphase aggregates preferentially deform by grain-size sensitive (GSS) creep processes, including grain-boundary sliding (GBS) and diffusion creep, which are inherently characterised by a \u201cweak\u201d linear-viscous rheology (Fig. 5c). However, the softening potential of GSR by dynamic recrystallisation of monomineralic aggregates is limited by the piezometric relationships and the balance between grain size reduction and crystal growth processes (De Bresser et al., 2001; Cross et al., 2015; Tokle and Hirth, 2021) (Fig. 5d). Effective softening is mainly related to the combined activation of GSR and PM processes resulting in polyphase aggregates (Kilian et al., 2011; Spruzeniece and Piazolo, 2015; Ceccato et al., 2018; Stenvall et al., 2019). Indeed, the polyphase mixed nature and fine grain size of these aggregates have two major consequences on the kinetics of rheology-controlling deformation mechanisms (Herwegh et al., 2011): (i). The fine grain size enhances the efficiency of diffusion-assisted creep processes (Coble creep, dissolution-precipitation creep) through the reduction of the diffusion length scales; (ii) PM hinders the efficiency of crystal growth by pinning, maintaining the overall grain size of the polyphase aggregates in the range where diffusion-assisted GSS creep is dominant (Fig. 5d). Therefore, GSR and PM are the key processes steering the evolution of shear zone strain-softened rheology, as well as of the shear zone micro- and meso-scale fabric. Whilst the strength of mono-phase aggregates can be estimated by paleopiezometers for dislocation creep (e.g., for quartz, Cross et al., 2017), the strength of polyphase mixed aggregates is still poorly constrained and requires the adoption of analytical mixing models under significant assumptions (Huet et al., 2014; Platt, 2015). Nevertheless, rheological mixing models can be very effective in the quantification of softening related to PM processes (e.g., Fig. 5c; Huet et al., 2014; Gerbi et al., 2016; Ceccato et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.2\nFabric and microstructural development\nProgressive GSR with increasing strain and metamorphic reactions lead to the development of fine-grained, recrystallized aggregates. These aggregates progressively merge, with increasing strain, to form the typical strain-dependent foliation observed along the ductile shear zone walls, leading to the transition from protomylonite, to mylonite and ultramylonite (Ramsay and Allison, 1979; Ramsay, 1980; White et al., 1980) (Fig. 1c). In particular, the development of the characteristic sigmoidal foliation of protomylonites is primarily controlled by the formation of a phyllosilicate-dominated interconnected weak layer (IWL) microstructure during the incipient stages of deformation (e.g., Handy, 1990; Holyoke and Tullis, 2006). With increasing strain, this phyllosilicate dominated IWL is however overtaken and disrupted by the development of an IWL microstructure formed by coalesced fine-grained, polyphase aggregates resulting from feldspars breakdown and neo-crystallisation (Hippertt and Hongn, 1998; Stenvall et al., 2019). As strain accommodation, coalescence and phase mixing progress, fine-grained homogeneous polyphase ultramylonites form, representing the final product of strain accommodation and rheological softening (Ramsay and Allison, 1979; Kilian et al., 2011; Cross and Skemer, 2017; Stenvall et al., 2019) (Fig. 6\na). Thus, the strength and textural evolution of ductile shear zones strictly depend on the fate of feldspar phases, forming the LBF in the protolith (Handy, 1990) (Fig. 6a). As described above, the dismantling of the feldspars-LBF is deeply affected by the H2O-saturation conditions of the system and the occurrence of mass-transfer processes, which in turn affect the final ultramylonitic mineral assemblage.\n\n\n4.3\nDeformation mechanisms and fluids\nAqueous fluids are agents of chemical (hydrolytic) softening in nominally anhydrous minerals (e.g., Kronenberg and Wolf, 1990; Bras et al., 2021; Ceccato et al., 2022). Similarly, the occurrence of a fluid phase may enhance the kinetics of retrograde metamorphic reactions aiding strain localisation, then affecting the shear zone bulk rheology as well (e.g., Spruzeniece and Piazolo, 2015; Stenvall et al., 2020). Consequently, the evolution of both the bulk fluid content of shear zone and the intracrystalline fluid content of mineral phases have major effects on the geometrical and rheological evolution of shear zones (Spruzeniece and Piazolo, 2015; Finch et al., 2016; Stenvall et al., 2020; Kaatz et al., 2021).\nIn turn, the microstructural and rheological evolution of shear zone with increasing strain may affect both the bulk fluid content of the shear zone and of its mineral constituents (Bestmann and Pennacchioni, 2015; Bestmann et al., 2021; Finch et al., 2016). Indeed, fluid content may evolve with increasing strain as an effect of feedback processes between deformation (GSR-PM), and metamorphic-metasomatic processes (Hobbs et al., 2010; Oliot et al., 2014; Finch et al., 2016; Kaatz et al., 2021). Second-order processes related to GSR may lead to both the release of intracrystalline fluids (e.g. fluid inclusions and intracrystalline H2O) into the shear zone, as well as to the drying up of the shear zones during recrystallisation as a consequence of increased grain boundary area (Pennacchioni and Cesare, 1997; Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2004; Bestmann and Pennacchioni, 2015). Furthermore, the activation of GSS creep and PM processes has a two-fold effect on fluid content (Fig. 6b): (i) they promote fluid flow toward the most strained portions of the shear zone through the development of local grain-scale dilatancy (i.e., creep cavitation; Fusseis et al., 2009; Menegon et al., 2015; Spruzeniece and Piazolo, 2015; Gilgannon et al., 2021); (ii) at the same time, the rheological contrast between the weak shear zone and the undeformed host rock may lead to pressure gradients driving fluids away from the shear zone toward the host rock (Mancktelow, 2006; Oliot et al., 2014; Finch et al., 2016; Menegon and Fagereng, 2021). The relevance of all these processes may change depending on the open vs. closed conditions of the system with respect to fluid flow, and upon the stabilization of a stable retrograde metamorphic paragenesis (Yardley and Valley, 1997; Diener et al., 2016; Stenvall et al., 2020). The rheology and geometry evolution of shear zones are therefore the results of a delicate equilibrium between fluid availability and deformation-metamorphic-metasomatic feedback processes at the microscale.\n\n\n\n5\nFinal remarks and future directions\nThe analysis of meta-granitoid rocks provided very helpful inferences for the understanding of (incipient) strain localisation processes in isotropic geological bodies at mid crustal conditions. Granitoid units, however, represent the exception rather than the rule for what regards the typical characters of metamorphic units in the continental crust and orogenic belts. The occurrence of pervasive heterogeneities (e.g., foliations) in metamorphic orogenic units, and the composition of such units themselves, might deeply affect the development of shear zones at general mid-crustal conditions (Rennie et al., 2013; Diener et al., 2016).\nSmall-scale shear zones in granitoid rocks predominantly nucleate exploiting precursor brittle structures and compositional heterogeneities. They nucleate and develop within a restricted temperature window (350\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C), during the retrograde or cooling path from amphibolite to greenschist facies metamorphic conditions. At these conditions, the meta-stable granitoid mineral assemblage is affected by a series of retrograde divariant reactions that assist strain accommodation within the shear zones. These reactions are spatially restricted, i.e. localised, within shear zones (and not in the host rock in general), suggesting that metamorphic retrograde equilibration of the metastable assemblage is promoted by either fluid-rock interaction or deformation processes taking place within the shear zones.\nThese reactions mainly involve breakdown of feldspar(s) with the resulting development of either fine-grained polyphase or phyllosilicate-rich aggregates. Thus, feldspar breakdown at retrograde conditions controls the evolution of both the rheology (through the activation of GSS creep mechanisms) and the fabric (through the development of phyllosilicate- or polyphase-aggregate-bearing IWL) of shear zones. Indeed, shear zone rheology is controlled by the activation of GSS creep and PM processes, which result in the strain softening rheology inferred by Ramsay and Graham (1970). Such microstructural processes have a major role in controlling the diffusion of fluids and the extent of metasomatic and retrograde metamorphic processes leading to host rock softening and shear zone widening.\nNotwithstanding the improvements provided by detailed field, analytical and numerical studies, several points remain unclear and deserve further analyses. We think that three main topics should be at the core of future research on shear zone development and strain localisation in both granitoid rocks and the continental crust in general, including: (1) quantification of strain evolution and rheology; (2) understanding transient vs. steady state evolution; (3) integrated, multiscale shear zone networking models.\nThe first aspect consists in the quantification of rates and magnitudes (e.g., progression of recrystallisation with strain) of deformation processes in natural shear zones, in order to be then compared to the results of experimental rock deformation and numerical modelling. Field, microstructural and petrological integrated analyses should aim at the quantification of the effects of the feedbacks between deformation, metamorphism and metasomatism on the rates and intensity of strain localisation and on the strength of ductile shear zones. The integration of rheological mixing models with quantitative microstructural observations along strain\/fluid gradients of small-scale shear zones will allow to quantify the effects of specific deformation, metamorphic and metasomatic processes on the bulk rheology of shear zones as a function of strain and of different degrees of fluid-rock interaction (Shigematsu, 1999; Gerbi et al., 2010; Cross and Skemer, 2019; Whyte et al., 2021). Both strain and fluid-gradients develop through time, and thus their analysis may provide fundamental insights into the evolution in time of microstructural processes, feedback mechanisms and rheology.\nIn addition, further investigations are necessary to understand the strict relationship between strain accommodation and the gradients of fluid-rock interaction intensity observed at various scale. Is there an effective transition from closed to open system with increasing strain and networking (Fourcade et al., 1989; Oliot et al., 2014)? What is the actual process controlling this transition?\nThese insights will in turn shed new light on other relevant questions: (i) what are the factors controlling the role of ductile shear zone as fluid pathways? and (ii), what controls the evolution of the equilibrium between fluid intake and expulsion? Transient vs. continuous fluid intake and fluid flow is then reflected on the softening mechanisms controlling strain accommodation through time. This will have significant implications for the understanding of transient vs. steady-state character of deformation. Therefore, the final questions become: is strain accommodation in shear zones continuous or discontinuous (i.e., transient vs. steady state deformation)? What are the parameters controlling transient vs. steady state deformation? Further improvements on geochronological dating techniques may provide the necessary tools to address this question (Oriolo et al., 2018).\nConsidering the nucleation of shear zones on precursor structures, what are the boundary conditions that drive shear zone widening and networking? Do small-scale shear zones effectively represent the seeds of larger scale mylonitic belts? To what scale do brittle and compositional precursors control the nucleation of shear zones? The existing models for shear zone growth and networking still partially fail to integrate field, microstructural and petrological observations consistently. So far, thickness-length-displacement data retrieved from detailed mapping of networks of meso-scale shear zones do not show any systematic trend in shear zone thickness variation, neither at small-scale, nor connecting the small-scale toward the large scale (Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018). Furthermore, the mechanisms for shear zone widening remain to be understood \u2013 that is, the reasons why a shear zone would widen with increasing accommodated strain (e.g., Platt and Behr, 2011b).\nRecent results from field, microstructural and numerical analyses have highlighted the effects of scale-dependent feedback mechanisms in controlling the geometry and the networking of general shear zones in space and time (Regenauer-Lieb and Yuen, 2003; Schrank et al., 2008b; Hobbs et al., 2010, 2011; Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2013; Oliot et al., 2014; Finch et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2016; Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2018; Kiss et al., 2019; Bras et al., 2021; Kaatz et al., 2021). Such feedback mechanisms largely originate from the interaction between deformation, mass transfer, chemical and heat diffusion (i.e. metamorphic and metasomatic) processes, which might take place at different length- and timescales during shear zone evolution (Fig. 2; e.g., Regenauer-Lieb and Yuen, 2003; Hobbs et al., 2010; Kaatz et al., 2021). Chemical diffusion and (metamorphic) reactions seem to control the thickness of small- and meso-scale shear zones. For example, Oliot et al. (2014) proposed a model for shear zone thickening and networking driven by fluid expulsion (meso-scale mass transfer) from shear zones, triggered by chemically and mechanically induced pressure gradients, with consequent metasomatic-softening reactions in the host rock. At larger scales (>103\u00a0m), shear heating may contribute significantly to the softening of the host rock leading to shear zone thickening (e.g., Kiss et al., 2019). The main result of such feedback mechanisms is the softening of the host rock, which in turn would lead to shear zone thickening. At first sight, these softening-driven model of shear zone thickening might seem to dispute the classical model of softening-narrowing shear zones (e.g., Means, 1995). However, rather than considering softening within the shear zone itself as the classical model does, such model predicts softening in the host rock along the selvages of the shear zone and shear zone tips, allowing more rock to be included in the deforming shear zone during softening (Oliot et al., 2014).\nDuring shear zone thickening and networking, the deforming systems may be subjected to different feedback processes controlling both the deformation mechanisms and the rate at which strain is accommodated (Schrank et al., 2008b; Hobbs et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2016; Bras et al., 2021). Therefore, we must consider these feedback mechanisms in the future studies that seek to explore the processes of networking and mesoscale evolution, integrating field, microstructural and petrological observations. These studies will need to be supported by an extended database of displacement vs. thickness data retrieved from quantitative, multiscale mapping of shear zone networks on optimally exposed outcrops. Accordingly, numerical models should aim at comparing their results with such databases provided by field analyses.\n\n\nCRediT author statement\n\nAlberto Ceccato: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 Original draft, review & editing; Philippe Goncalves: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 Original draft, review & editing; Luca Menegon: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Writing \u2013Review & editing.\n\n","44":"","45":"","46":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe vortical flow associated with progressive deformation within shear zones and between shear zone pairs can significantly affect the geometries of pre-existing and contemporaneous fabrics and structures (e.g., veins, faults, and dykes; Beach, 1975; Platt, 1983; Ramsay et al., 1983a; Lister and Snoke, 1984; Passchier, 1986; Olson and Pollard, 1991; Alsop et al., 2021). This occurs at a variety of scales, and correctly interpreting these geometries with an appreciation for rotational dynamics can greatly enhance both local and regional structural and tectonic models (e.g., Fossen et al., 2019). These interpretations not only have fundamental scientific implications, but can also have key practical applications where ore bodies in the form of e.g., vein systems, intrusions, and stratiform layers are progressively deformed (Hodgson, 1989; Windh, 1995; Laing, 2004; Perret et al., 2020). Despite the concept of vorticity being widely recognised in structural geology (e.g., Xypolias, 2010), its application including an appreciation of the implications for ore deposit evolution has been much more uncommon (e.g., Blenkinsop et al., 2020). Instead, ore deposit models typically treat metalliferous vein systems as planar fractures that propagate with predictable opening modes and orientations relative to an overarching stress field, without considering contemporaneous and progressive rotation or folding (e.g., Sibson, 1996; Robert and Poulsen, 2001). In such models, discrepancies in vein geometry and evidence of successive deformation is typically assigned to separate and polyphase deformation events. In those ore deposit vein models which do document progressive deformation, the vein systems are typically treated as en-echelon tension vein arrays with a principal focus on how the geometry of the forming ore body evolves with increasing strain (Fig. 1\nA) (e.g., Laing, 2004). However, the next step into an understanding of more complex vein geometries should involve an appreciation of the complexity of shear zones and how geometric and kinematic reversals can occur along veins during rotation within evolving shear zones and between shear zone pairs (e.g., Fig. 1B and 1C) (Ghosh, 1966; Ramsay et al., 1983b; Hudleston, 1989; Harris, 2003). Lack of this appreciation could lead to metalliferous vein deposits being misinterpreted to have polyphase deformation histories to account for opposing geometric and kinematic indicators that can instead be explained by a single and coherent progressive model (e.g., Fig. 1B and 1C) (after Fossen et al., 2019). A consequence of such misinterpretations might be how metallogenic events relate to the regional structural and tectonic evolution of a province which can subsequently impair exploration models and strategies.\nIn this contribution, we investigate whether the formation of an economic vein deposit that has previously been interpreted to have formed during successive phases of polyphase deformation can instead be better explained by a progressive formation model. We do this by examining the Cavanacaw (formerly known as the Omagh or Lack) vein-hosted Au\u2013Ag\u2013Pb deposit (>0.5 Moz Au) in Northern Ireland (Fig. 2\n) (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). The hosting Dalradian Supergroup rocks of the Grampian Terrane are part of the Irish-Scottish sector of the Laurentian Caledonian belt which formed during the prolonged Caledonian Orogeny (Ordovician\u2013Devonian), but was locally affected by the later Variscan Orogeny (Carboniferous). The Laurentian Caledonides hosts several auriferous and polymetallic vein deposits and non-economic occurrences that are interpreted to relate to either or both orogenic cycles (Fig. 2) (Pattrick, 1985; Pattrick et al., 1988; Samson and Banks, 1988; Pattrick and Russell, 1989; Earls et al., 1992; Cliff and Wolfenden et al., 1992; Curtis et al., 1993; Earls et al., 1996; Ixer et al., 1997; Wilkinson et al., 1999; Treagus et al., 1999; Parnell et al., 2000; Lusty et al., 2011; Mark et al., 2013; Rice et al., 2016; Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018). For Cavanacaw, previous studies used cathodoluminescence, fluid inclusion, and stable isotope analyses to interpret the deposit to have had a long-lived and polyphase deformation history that was directly associated with the economic mineralisation: the broadly N\u2013S-striking, complexly deformed vein system is inferred to have been initiated during the Ordovician Grampian event of the Caledonian orogeny (c. 470 Ma) and to have been mineralised through the reactivation and injection of two distinct regional fluid flow pulses during the Caledonian (470\u2013400\u00a0Ma) and Variscan (c. 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) orogenies (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Earlier studies have further documented broad similarities in ore mineral assemblages, associated gangue phases, and fluid chemistry to interpret the world-class Curraghinalt orogenic gold deposit (>6 Moz Au), located c. 27\u00a0km to the northeast of Cavanacaw, to be genetically related (Fig. 3\n) (Earls et al., 1996; Wilkinson et al., 1999; Parnell et al., 2000; Dalradian Resources Inc, 2018). These interpretations above are problematic, however, as: (1) the vein systems at both localities have significantly different strike orientations and kinematics that are not easily reconciled by a common and contemporaneous event; (2) the ore mineralogy and paragenesis between the two deposits actually differs significantly, with arsenopyrite abundant in the primary stage and galena dominating in the secondary stage following intense brecciation at Cavanacaw, whereas these phases are largely absent at Curraghinalt (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000); and (3) gold in the form of electrum differs in alloy composition and is most abundant in the primary sulphide stage at Curraghinalt but is associated with the secondary stage at Cavanacaw (Earls et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 2000; Parnell et al., 2000). The Curraghinalt deposit has recently been dated through 40Ar\/39Ar (sericite) and Re\u2013Os (molybdenite) to have formed during a c. 10 Ma window in the Late Ordovician (462.7\u2013452.8\u00a0Ma), i.e., during the late\/post-Grampian, post-orogenic \u2018collapse\u2019 event (Rice et al., 2016). Few age data from the other known polymetallic systems in the UK and Irish Caledonides exist but the available data from Cononish and Rhynie in Scotland show considerably younger Early Devonian U\u2013Pb (zircon) and 40Ar\/39Ar (K-feldspar) ages between 412\u2013407\u00a0Ma (Fig. 2; Treagus et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2012). The implications of the geochronological data in respect to Cavanacaw and other vein occurrences in the Caledonides is yet to be considered despite Curraghinalt being the largest known gold deposit in the UK and Ireland by a considerable margin (>5 Moz Au).\nIn this study, we demonstrate through the examination and interpretation of largely unpublished archival historic trench and underground maps, as well as through our own structural measurements and observations, that although the wider Cavanacaw area records a polyphase deformation history, the formation of the economic, metalliferous vein system can be explained by a single progressive deformational model. The progressive deformation model accounts for the varying vein orientations and textures, swings in host rock foliation orientations from the regional trend, and opposing vein geometries\/kinematics in respect to the overall shear direction. The model produced has significant implications for interpretations regarding the timing and geodynamic setting in which the vein system formed (e.g., Cliff and Wolfenden et al., 1992; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). We also present analysis from other nearby gold vein occurrences in the western Sperrin Mountains to assess how these may link to Cavanacaw and, in turn, develop a regional structural and tectonic model to account for the large-scale structures that appear to be significant for the economic mineralisation. Finally, we use our analysis to assess how Cavanacaw may relate to both the nearby, and better understood, Late Ordovician and Grampian event related Curraghinalt deposit and to the broader gold and polymetallic vein metallogeny hosted by the Laurentian Caledonian belt of Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and context of metallic mineralisation in the Laurentian Caledonides\nThe Dalradian Supergroup rocks of the Grampian Terrane that host the Cavanacaw deposit represent a succession of late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks (Figs. 2 and 3). These were deposited onto the southeastern passive margin of the Laurentian continent during the opening of the Iapetus Ocean (c. 800\u2013510\u00a0Ma) (Cooper and Johnston, 2004). The subsequent convergence of Laurentia with Baltica and Avalonia lead to the closure of Iapetus during the prolonged Caledonian-Appalachian Orogeny, which in the UK and Ireland is subdivided into the Grampian event (Early\u2013Middle Ordovician) and the Scandian event (Silurian\u2013Early Devonian) (McKerrow et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2008; Stephenson et al., 2013; Chew and Strachan, 2014).\nThe Grampian event in Northern Ireland initiated with an island arc-ophiolite complex from the Midland Valley Terrane (the Tyrone Igneous Complex) accreting onto an outboard microcontinent block of Laurentia (the Tyrone Central Inlier) (c. 475 Ma) (Figs. 2 and 3) (Chew et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2011; Hollis et al., 2012, 2013). The continuing NW\u2013SE convergence and the closure of the palaeo-ocean between the composite Tyrone Igneous Complex and Laurentia subsequently folded the Dalradian Supergroup rocks into recumbent SE-to SSE-verging isoclinal nappes to produce regional stratigraphic repetitions; this closure culminated in ESE-directed oblique-dextral thrusting of the Dalradian nappes over the Tyrone Igneous Complex and Central Inlier along the Omagh Thrust (c. 475\u2013465\u00a0Ma) (Figs. 3 and 4\n) (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). Cavanacaw, as well as the Curraghinalt deposit, are hosted on one of the SSE-verging, overturned limbs of these major isoclinal nappes; the Sperrin Nappe (Fig. 3). At the current exposure level, upper greenschist to lower amphibolite grade metamorphic conditions were reached during nappe formation (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). The ESE-directed motion of the nappe was principally accommodated by the regional Omagh Thrust Fault, which broadly dips moderately (40\u00b0) towards the NW to NNW (Figs. 3 and 5\n) (Alsop and Hutton, 1993a). The Omagh Thrust Fault is interpreted to be a footwall splay of the steeper, concealed Fair Head\u2013Clew Bay line which is thought to be the continuation of the Highland Boundary Fault in Scotland (Fig. 2) (Max and Riddihough, 1975; Hutton, 1987). The recent geochronological data from the Curraghinalt deposit (c. 463\u2013453\u00a0Ma) suggests that the vein propagation and mineralisation occurred immediately after the main thrusting and crustal thickening of the Grampian event (Rice et al., 2016). The exact structural setting of the Curraghinalt deposit and its relationship to the overall Grampian orogenic evolution is still unclear as no detailed, deposit-specific structural data and model have yet been published; however, the WNW\u2013ESE-striking vein array appears to be spatially associated with E\u2013W-striking shear zones (Fig. 3). The Curraghinalt mineralisation age is only slightly younger than a suite of c. 470\u2013464 Ma calc-alkaline 'stitching' intrusions in the Tyrone Igneous Complex that were interpreted to be associated with subduction polarity reversal (Fig. 3) (Cooper et al., 2011).\nThe subsequent Scandian event involved a sinistrally transpressive closure of the Iapetus Ocean as Laurentia and its accreted island arc and ophiolite complexes collided with Baltica and Avalonia (Soper et al., 1992). In the UK and Ireland, the regional crustal thickening and metamorphism associated with the \u2018head-on\u2019 Laurentia and Baltica collision (c. 440\u2013429\u00a0Ma) appears to be largely restricted to the Northern Highland Terrane of Scotland (resulting in the deformation within the Moine Supergroup; Fig. 2), while the Grampian Terrane was either: (1) located several hundred kilometres south of the collision zone (Dewey and Strachan, 2003); or (2) a rigid block within the contractional deformation zone at the leading edges of the colliding plates (Leslie et al., 2008). However, the Grampian Terrane was not totally unaffected by the Scandian event. The \u2018head on\u2019 collision may be dated at c. 437 Ma (U\u2013Pb zircon age) in the Dalradian Supergroup of Donegal through xenoliths found within a lamprophyre containing a magmatic foliation parallel to that in the host rock (Kirkland et al., 2013). These late-stage regional fabrics are indicative of syn-kinematic emplacement during regional NW\u2013SE compression (Kirkland et al., 2013; Alsop, 1996). The N to NNE-directed Laurentia and Avalonia collision that followed in the mid-Silurian (c. 430\u2013425\u00a0Ma) emplaced an Ordovician\u2013Silurian fore-arc accretionary complex onto the Laurentian margin (the Down\u2013Longford Terrane in central Ireland and Southern Uplands Terrane in Scotland) (Fig. 2) (Chew and Strachan, 2014; Stone, 2014). This collision was highly oblique, and crustal-scale sinistral strike-slip movement ensued along orogen-parallel NE- to ENE-striking faults and shear zones both within the Grampian Terrane and the accretionary complex to the SE (e.g., Hutton, 1982; Soper et al., 1992; Dewey and Strachan 2003). This event was contemporaneous with the emplacement of voluminous felsic magmatism, possibly during either local or regional transtension interpreted to relate to a slab \u2018break-off\u2019 or delamination (Fig. 2) (Atherton and Ghani, 2002; Cooper et al., 2016; Miles et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2018). Overall, the regional Scandian, sinistral transpression had been replaced by regional sinistral transtension by the Early Devonian which led to the formation of depositional basins (c. 410\u2013395\u00a0Ma; Dewey and Strachan, 2003). Deposition was interrupted by the short-lived and northward-directed Acadian (Proto-Variscan) event between c. 400\u2013390\u00a0Ma where major pre-existing faults and shear zones accommodated sinistral transpression in Scotland (Mendum, 2012).\nApart from Curraghinalt, the only two gold occurrences within the Grampian Terrane that have been dated (Cononish and Rhynie in Scotland) formed during the Scandian event (Fig. 2) (412\u2013407\u00a0Ma; Treagus et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2012). Cononish, as well as many other metalliferous vein systems such as those at Croagh Patrick and Clontibret \u2013 Clay Lake in Ireland, have been interpreted to be hosted by NNE- to NNW-striking Riedel, antithetic Riedel, and tension fractures related to NE to ENE-striking sinistral strike-slip faults and a broadly horizontal, approximately N to NNE-orientated maximum principal stress (see Figs. 2 and 4) (Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018). Most of the known metalliferous vein systems have not yet been studied in detail, but many are spatially related to the post-Grampian to Scandian calc-alkaline granitoids and, at least at Cononish where most data are available, are enriched in metals indicative of a magmatic affinity (e.g., Te, Bi, Mo, Cu, Pb, and Zn) (Curtis et al., 1993; Rice et al., 2018; Spence-Jones et al., 2018).\nAt least some of the major NE to ENE-striking transcurrent faults were reactivated during the Carboniferous Variscan (Hercynian) Orogeny in response to a broadly WNW\u2013ESE compression (Fig. 4). During the early to mid-Carboniferous, it is interpreted that WNW\u2013ESE-directed compression in Northern Ireland induced a zone of dextral transpression between the Omagh Thrust\u2013Castle Archdale and reactivated Caledonian faults to the southeast, uplifting the Lack and Lisbellaw Inlier basement blocks as a positive flower structure (Mitchell, 2004). The timing of this correlates with the K\u2013Ar model ages (327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) presented by Earls et al. (1996) and Parnell et al. (2000) on clay-rich fault-gouge samples collected from across the Sperrin Mountains. The transpression was followed by a switch to extension and the formation of depositional basins (e.g., the Newtownstewart Basin) (Fig. 3; Mitchell, 2004). The end of the Variscan was characterised by a return to oblique-dextral overthrusting along the regional Omagh Thrust Fault (Mitchell, 2004). There seems to have been brittle reactivation of at least some of the metalliferous vein systems during the Carboniferous, responsible for paragenetically late base metal-only mineralisation, particularly at Cononish (Samson and Banks, 1988; Earls et al., 1996; Treagus et al., 1999; Parnell et al., 2000; Lusty et al., 2011). It is notable, however, that the recent geochronology data presented by Rice et al. (2016) suggests that brines of Carboniferous age and origin were not involved in the paragenetically late base metal mineralisation at Curraghinalt as initially proposed by Wilkinson et al. (1999).\n\n\n3\nDetailed description of study area\n\n3.1\nThe Lack Inlier\nThe study area and the Cavanacaw deposit are located within the so-called Lack Inlier, 5\u00a0km west southwest of the town of Omagh (Fig. 3). The Lack Inlier is an uplifted and fault-bounded package of Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks that belong to the Dalradian Supergroup (GSNI, 1995a; Cooper and Johnston, 2004). The foliation within the inlier is parallel to subparallel to bedding and generally strikes ENE\u2013WSW and dips moderately towards to the NNW (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). The Lack Inlier consists primarily of schistose psammites, semipelites, and pelites of the Mullaghcarn Formation that are interbedded with basic volcaniclastic rocks of the Largy Volcanic Member (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; McFarlane et al., 2009). The northern and southeastern margins of the inlier are bounded by the Cool Fault and the Omagh Thrust\u2013Castle Archdale Fault complex respectively, both of which are hosted in the strongly deformed graphitic semipelites of the Glengawna Formation (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; McFarlane et al., 2009). These ENE\u2013WSW-striking long-lived faults juxtapose the Dalradian Supergroup metamorphic rocks against the younger Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks that surround the Lack Inlier (GSNI, 1995a). A series of other steep ENE\u2013WSW-striking transcurrent faults, such as the Sperrin Fault, are also mapped as internally dissecting the inlier (Fig. 5). Northeast of Omagh, Tyrone Igneous Complex rocks are present in the footwall of the Omagh Thrust Fault (Fig. 3; GSNI, 1995b). The extent of the Tyrone Igneous Complex underneath the Lack Inlier in this area is unknown but a prominent bouguer anomaly (Dromore High; Fig. 3) may indicate its presence at depth (Reay, 2004). A swarm of Palaeogene dykes striking NW to WNW represent the youngest geological feature in the region (Fig. 5) (GSNI, 1995a; Cooper et al., 2012).\n\n\n3.2\nThe \u2018Omagh Lineament\u2019\nA deep-seated, NNE\u2013SSW-trending crustal lineament has been interpreted to run through the eastern part of Lack Inlier and the Cavanacaw deposit (Fig. 3) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2013). This \u2018Omagh Lineament\u2019 is inferred to extend along strike for an overall length of 70\u00a0km from Drumahoe in County Londonderry (NNE) to Tempo in County Fermanagh (SSW). The Omagh Lineament is one of many N to NNE-striking deep-seated crustal lineaments that are inferred to exist across Scotland and Ireland that may be as old as 1800\u00a0Ma (Russel and Hazeldine, 1992; Hutton and Alsop, 1996; Earls et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2013). The Omagh Lineament is a rather weak feature on geophysical surveys (e.g., Tellus surveys; GSNI, 2007a) and its existence is largely inferred based on the presence of the N\u2013S-striking Cavanacaw vein system; a significant swing in the strike of the Dalradian metamorphic rocks from ENE\u2013WSW (075\u00b0\u2013255\u00b0) strikes to NNE\u2013SSW (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) strikes; the rare occurrence of a basic Palaeogene dyke (Cooper et al., 2012) and the eastern extent of the quartz porphyry \u2018Sperrin Mountains Suite\u2019 of minor intrusions (Cooper et al., 2013); N\u2013S-striking minor faults; and by the approximate location of the eastern margin of the Dromore High bouguer anomaly (Fig. 3) (GSNI, 1997; Reay, 2004; Cooper et al., 2013). The most prominent feature of these is the significant swing in strike of the Dalradian metamorphic rocks across the Newtownstewart region, just north of the Lack Inlier; we call this feature the \u2018West Sperrin Knee Bend\u2019 (Fig. 3). According to our interpretations in this paper, the West Sperrin Knee Bend plays an important role in the development of the mineralisation and regional deformation.\n\n\n3.3\nThe Cavanacaw resource, ore mineralogy, and paragenesis\nThe Cavanacaw deposit has a measured resource of 32,202 oz at 7.24\u00a0g\/t Au, an indicated resource of 147,784 oz at 6.78\u00a0g\/t Au, and an inferred resource of 341,123 oz at 7.71\u00a0g\/t Au according to most recent estimates (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). Ag is alloyed with the Au, with average assay results ranging between 1 and 2.5 parts of Ag to 1 part of Au (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). Assay results further report up to several percent Pb in the veins (Galantas Gold Corporation, 2014). The Au\u2013Ag\u2013Pb resource is structurally hosted by steep 1\u20133\u00a0m wide zones of quartz-sulphide veining, shearing, and sericite alteration that cross-cut the host rock and foliation fabrics (Fig. 6\nA) (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). Most of the resource is hosted by the Kearney vein structure which was historically exploited in an open excavation pit (now mostly infilled) and is currently being mined in a series of underground tunnels (Fig. 6A). The discovery and exploration history of the deposit is detailed extensively in Cliff and Wolfenden (1992) and Galantas Gold Corporation (2014, 2020).\nSeveral sulphide phases are present in the veins but the most common are aggregates of pyrite (Py) and arsenopyrite (AsPy) which are typically intensely brecciated and cemented\/replaced by undeformed galena and chalcopyrite (Fig. 6B) (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). Minor carbonate can also be found in the quartz veins (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). The primary, pre-breccia Py\u2013AsPy dominated stage is suggested to be related to broadly Caledonian (470\u2013400\u00a0Ma) fluids with a significant magmatic component by Earls et al. (1996) and Parnell et al. (2000), based mostly on extrapolation of analysis undertaken at Curraghinalt. The secondary sulphide stage is dominated by base metals, particularly galena, followed by a late phase of carbonate-rich mineralisation (Fig. 6B; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Analysis of fluid inclusions in the late quartz phases at Cavanacaw indicate high salinity brines which were interpreted to relate to basinal fluids mobilised during the Variscan orogeny (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Relatively low fluid inclusion trapping pressures have been interpreted to suggest the mineralisation was precipitated at epizonal crustal depths (<5\u00a0km) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). The repeated localisation of deformation and fluids into the Cavanacaw vein system is attributed to the structural reactivation of the Omagh Lineament (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000).\nElectrum (Au, Ag) is typically anhedral, located along narrow 1\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm wide fractures in pyrite and spatially-associated with quartz\/Py boundaries, implying that electrum precipitated during the second, breccia-related deformation stage along with base metal sulphides (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992; Earls et al., 1996; Chapman et al., 2000; Parnell et al., 2000). Au can also be found as trace substitutions within the galena (up to 1.2\u00a0at. % Au) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). It is currently unclear whether the Au was remobilised from the first-stage Py\u2013AsPy phase during this second deformation stage.\nThe alteration halos around the larger veins are typically comprised of sericitised and bleached host rock that can extend outwards for several metres before grading into unaltered wall rock (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). Black sulphidic clay-rich fault-gouge can also form part of the alteration halo (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). These alteration halos are most prolific in quartz-poor metasedimentary host rocks such as graphitic semipelites and are associated with sulphides and veinlets (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). McFarlane et al. (2009) identify laterally persistent (up to 4\u00a0km long) ENE\u2013WSW-striking zones that show relatively low magnetic responses and are in the field thoroughly sericitised and silicified (Fig. 5A).\n\n\n3.4\nThe Cavanacaw deposit structural setting\nA 150\u2013200\u00a0m wide structure that relates to zones of high conductivity identified through an induced polarisation survey, the Lack Shear Zone, crosses the Cavanacaw area, striking ENE\u2013WSW and dipping steeply to the N (Figs. 5 and 6A). The Cavanacaw vein system is dominated by major N\u2013S-striking veins to the north of the Lack Shear Zone (e.g., Kearney and Joshua veins; Fig. 6A). Another important, subsidiary NNW\u2013SSE-striking vein system also exists to the south of the shear zone (e.g., Discovery, Gormley, Sharkey veins; Fig. 6A). These two broad veining zones are hereafter referred to as the \u2018Kearney zone\u2019 and \u2018Creevan zone\u2019, respectively (Fig. 6A).\nThe N\u2013S-striking veins in the Kearney zone are more continuous along strike, with the Kearney vein drill-tested to continue for at least 850\u00a0m and to extend to at least 300\u00a0m depth. In the Creevan zone, the vein system consists of a series of NNW\u2013SSE-striking veins with limited along strike continuity (<200\u00a0m). The Creevan zone veins and the Lack Shear Zone are located near the lithological boundary between the Mullaghcarn Formation and Glengawna Formations along the Creevan Burn stream section (Fig. 5; McFarlane et al., 2009; Galantas Gold Corporation, 2020).\nAll veins are vertical or dip steeply (towards east or west) irrespective of strike orientation. Initial workers interpreted the N\u2013S-striking veins to be antithetic principal (P\u2032) shears and the NNW\u2013SSE-striking veins to be subsidiary antithetic Riedel (R\u2019) shears within an overall reverse-dextral shear zone system of the Omagh Thrust that formed during broadly NW\u2013SE-directed Grampian compression (Fig. 4; c. 475\u2013465\u00a0Ma) (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). The specific localisation of the vein system was later attributed to partitioning of Grampian strain along the Omagh Lineament (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). The N\u2013S-striking Kearney vein was interpreted to be hosted by a co-planar shear zone with sinistral displacement, whilst the subsidiary NNW\u2013SSE-striking veins were interpreted to be later structures that cross-cut and displace the principal structure (Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). This kinematic framework is further reported to be replicated in nearby N\u2013S-striking regional veins, such as the Rylagh gold vein locality which also records sinistral kinematics (Fig. 3; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Several regional veins such as Rylagh are hosted on the NNE\u2013SSW-striking limb of the West Sperrin Knee Bend proximal to the Omagh Thrust Fault (<5\u00a0km distance) (Fig. 3).\nThe interpretation of a Variscan phase within the Cavanacaw vein system (by Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000) is based on model ages derived from isotope studies (K\u2013Ar and Rb\u2013Sr) on clay-rich fault-gouge sampled from the Kearney vein and low angle thrusts along the Creevan Burn stream section and regionally across the Sperrin Mountains (mean age of 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). These ages were used to further support the interpretation that the paragenetically late base metal phase of mineralisation was precipitated during the early Carboniferous (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000). Variscan reactivation is also used to account for the interpretation that the Lack Shear Zone apparently displaces the Cavanacaw vein system in a dextral sense, and for dextral movements on several small-scale faults along the Creevan stream section (Fig. 6A; Cliff and Wolfenden, 1992). In this paper, we present a re-interpretation of the kinematic models and inferred ages outlined above.\n\n\n\n4\nMethodology\n\n4.1\nData collection and sources\nThe structural data presented in this study includes observations and measurements collected directly in the field, as well as that compiled from historic exploration data. At Cavanacaw, the historic data includes a collection of trench, stream section, and underground geological maps produced historically by RioFinex North Limited (once a subsidiary of Rio Tinto) in the 1980s (when the deposit was discovered) and more recently by Galantas Gold Corporation (current operators). The Kearney zone was until recently exposed in an open excavation pit (Fig. 7\nA\u2013F) and historically in a series of major exploration trenches produced by RioFinex and Galantas (e.g., Figs. 9, 10A, and 11B). The pits and trenches are now mostly infilled, and the Kearney zone veins are currently exposed in a series of underground exploration tunnels that exceed 2\u00a0km in length over four levels (Fig. 10B). The Creevan zone is primarily exposed for over 2\u00a0km along the Creevan Burn stream section which exploits and strikes parallel to the Lack Shear Zone (e.g., Fig. 7G, 7H, and 8\n\n\n\n). Creevan zone veins were historically exposed in several exploration trenches produced by RioFinex (now all infilled) (Figs. 11A and 11C\u2013F). The authors of the historic exploration data are highlighted where known, however in many cases the authors of the RioFinex trench maps are unfortunately not recorded and the data was found archived at the Cavanacaw mine site. For the most part the trench maps have not been previously published, though a relatively small portion of the northern Kearney exploration trench (part of Fig. 9D) is presented in Cliff and Wolfenden (1992) and the exploration trench maps of the Kerr vein array (Fig. 10A) are presented in Galantas Gold Corporation (2008). The underground maps of the Kearney vein (see Fig. 10B) have recently been published in Galantas Gold Corporation (2020) to document the occurrence of ore shoots. Additional field data include a geological map of the Creevan Burn stream section (Fig. 8A; Galantas Gold Corporation, 2020).\nMost of our regional vein data was collected in the field along poorly exposed stream sections. For comparison, we also have structural data from a detailed geological map from another vein system, the Rylagh vein c. 5\u00a0km NE from the Cavanacaw mine (Fig. 3 and 12). This vein system was visited in the field to ground check the map. Digital structural data provided by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI) has also been compiled to analyse regional structures such as the West Sperrin Knee Bend. This digital data originates from the Omagh, Draperstown, and Newtownstewart 1: 50,000 geological mapping sheets (GSNI, 1995a, 1995b, 2008).\nWe combine the existing maps and material with our own field observations to propose a new, more comprehensive, holistic interpretation of the structure of the Cavanacaw system. Regardless of where the data was collected or compiled from, particular attention has been paid to host rock foliation fabrics and their relative orientations, the geometry and cross-cutting relationships of the vein and fault structures, the kinematics of the structures (from e.g., displacements and foliation drag), the textures of veins and whether structures are sulphidic and therefore likely to be associated with the metallic mineralisation. This has enabled a deformation sequence to be established for the host rock foliation fabrics, vein and faults systems, and reveals how the economic mineralisation relates to these.\n\n\n4.2\nData analysis\nThe structural data for the different areas analysed (i.e., the Kearney zone, Creevan zone, and regionally), as well as data for the individual vein and fault populations, were plotted on equal angle stereonets using Rick Allmendinger's stereonet application (Table 1\n, Fig. 13). The diagrams also illustrate textural variability and sulphide content (see key in Fig. 13). Mean vectors of the rose diagrams were calculated as well as the 1% area contouring of the calculated poles (Table 1; Fig. 13). Using the stereonets we analyse how the structure orientations and kinematics compare to a theoretical Riedel fault model for transcurrent simple shear (after Wilcox et al., 1973) (Fig. 14). The kinematic analysis allows us to interpret what the orientation of the principal stresses was when the vein and fault systems formed (Fig. 14). This approach has proven successful for confining and interpreting the palaeostress fields responsible for other steeply dipping to vertical auriferous vein and fault systems hosted by the Laurentian Caledonides of Ireland and Scotland (see Tanner, 2014).\n\n\n\n5\nObservations\n\n5.1\nCavanacaw host rock lithologies and structural fabrics\nThe main host rock lithologies and structures observed at Cavanacaw are consistent with those observed and detailed by Cliff and Wolfenden (1992), McFarlane et al. (2009), and Galantas Gold Corporation (2020). Exposure in the open excavation pit shows heterolithic psammitic and semi-pelitic metasediments dominate in the Kearney zone (Fig. 7B\u2013D). The Creevan Burn stream section transverses through various host rock lithologies (Fig. 8): graphitic pelites, typically interbedded with layers of quartzo-feldspathic semi-pelites, dominate to the east of the Cavanacaw bridge, whilst mixed quartz-muscovite semi-pelites, which can be sericitic and\/or chloritic, dominate to the west (Fig. 8). As observed by McFarlane et al. (2009), intervals and disseminations of fuchsite, pyrite, and metacarbonate pods have been identified in the graphitic pelites, whilst intervals of possible talc-bearing metasediments have been observed across all lithologies. An interval of graphitic pelite (up to 15\u00a0m thick) is also observed upstream of the Discovery vein and is intensely deformed and exploited by a shallowly NW to WNW-dipping reverse shear zone (Fig. 8). The repetition of units across the area may imply that tectonic imbrication exists in the Creevan zone (Fig. 8A). This interpretation is compatible with the broader geological mapping of the Creevan Burn stream section presented in Galantas Gold Corporation (2020).\nThe host rock sequence across the Cavanacaw area is inverted, which is evidenced by graded bedding in massive psammite units downwards into relatively heterolithic psammite\/pelites (i.e., structurally inverted graded bedding), and sharp lithological changes between psammite-dominated layers and structurally overlying semi-pelite-dominated layers. Two pervasive ductile planar fabrics are identifiable in the host rocks (Fig. 7B and 7C). The first, best developed in the psammitic host rocks, is a pervasive grain-shaped fabric defined by the preferential alignment of mica (S1a) and dips more shallowly to the NW than bedding (S0) (Fig. 7B). Elliptical quartz grains in the psammites also defines this fabric. In the semi-pelitic host rocks, a second penetrative, pervasive fabric crenulates the earlier fabric (interpreted as S1b) and is marked by the strong parallel alignment of muscovite and chlorite that dips relatively steeper to the NW than S0 (Fig. 7C). S1b envelopes elongated lenticular ribbons and augen of metamorphic quartz vein, whilst cm-scale dark green to black porphyroblasts of chlorite (retrogressed garnet) are also developed along the schistosity. Both S1a and S1b are consistent with overall overturning and thrusting of the Sperrin Nappe. Locally, an extensional crenulation cleavage (Sext) can be found to deform S1b in the semi-pelites, suggesting a relatively late episode of top-down-to-NW movement (Fig. 7D).\nThe average strike of the composite, sub-parallel bedding-foliation fabric in the host rock differs between the Kearney and Creevan zones; these, in turn, differ from the average strike of the host rock bedding-foliation fabric observed regionally across the Lack Inlier (Fig. 13B, 13E, and 13J). Across the eastern and central portions of the Lack Inlier, the composite host rock fabric strikes ENE\u2013WSW (076\u00b0\u2013256\u00b0) and dips moderately (49\u00b0) towards the NNW (Fig. 13J). In the Kearney zone, the strike of the host rock fabric is orientated anticlockwise of that observed in the Lack Inlier and strikes NE\u2013SW (055\u00b0\u2013235\u00b0) and dips moderately (36\u00b0) towards the NW (Fig. 13B). Finally, the strike of the host rock fabric in the Creevan zone is orientated anticlockwise of those observed in the Lack Inlier and Kearney zone, and strikes NNE\u2013SSW (019\u00b0\u2013199\u00b0) and dips moderately (41\u00b0) towards the WNW (Fig. 13E). In the Creevan zone, this produces a marked, low-amplitude s-shaped swing in the strike of the host rock foliation as the Lack Shear Zone is transected (hereafter, the \u2018Creevan swing\u2019) (see Fig. 8A). There is no significant change in the dip across the zones, however dip is somewhat shallower in the Kearney (36\u00b0) and Creevan zones (41\u00b0) than in the eastern and central portions of the Lack Inlier (49\u00b0) (Table 1, Fig. 13B, 13E, and 13J).\n\n\n5.2\nCavanacaw mineralised veins\nThe mineralised vein strikes range from NNE to WNW across both the Kearney and Creevan zones (Fig. 13A and 13D). However, the average vein strike differs between the Kearney and Creevan zones; being N\u2013S (171\u00b0\u2013351\u00b0) and NW\u2013SE (139\u00b0\u2013319\u00b0), respectively. The veins are typically vertical to steeply dipping in both zones (on average 69\u00b0 and 74\u00b0, respectively) (Table 1; Fig. 13A and 13D). Note that the mean dip values in Table 1 are likely to be an underestimate as vein dip only seems to have been measured and plotted on the trench maps when deviating from subvertical. The veins range in thickness from mm-wide veinlets to up to 3\u00a0m wide tabular veins (Figs. 8\u201311). They are typically, though not always, enveloped by clay-rich fault-gouge that can entrain clasts of mineralisation derived from the central vein(s) (Fig. 9). A sericite alteration zone that can exceed 5\u00a0m in width around the veins is also common, especially around the major veins. Host rock adjacent to the vein can also be mineralised, especially where heavily jointed and\/or faulted (Fig. 9B site 2). The major veins in both the Kearney and Creevan zones strike at a relatively high angle to the strike of the host rock foliation (typically \u223c45\u00b0; Fig. 13A and 13B, Fig. 13D and 13E), although the host rock fabric can vary significantly around the veins or swing into parallelism with the vein (e.g., Fig. 9).\nThe RioFinex trench plans in Fig. 9 present the most detailed vein and host rock maps and data for the Kearney vein which was captured in the northern exploration trench. It is hosted within a complex high-strain shear zone that causes the adjacent host rock to proximally swing into parallelism with the structure (Fig. 9). The Kearney vein is mapped to be continuous along strike in the trench and in underground exposure but does exhibit a classic \u2018pinch\u2019 and \u2018swell\u2019 geometry, ranging from 0.01 to 3\u00a0m in thickness (Figs. 9 and 10). The vein is also mapped to occasionally split into arrays of smaller veins (<1\u00a0m thick), such as in the centre of the northern exploration trench, before coalescing back into a tabular vein (Fig. 9B and 9C). Although the orientation of the broadly N\u2013S-striking Kearney vein is generally consistent in both the exploration trenches and in underground exposure, variations are common along the strike of the vein, including a prominent z-shaped buckle in the RioFinex southern exploration trench (Fig. 11B). Although less pronounced, similar z-shaped buckles are also mapped by Galantas in the Eastern Lagoon vein within the Kerr vein array (Fig. 10A), and in the Kearney vein underground (Fig. 10B).\nWhere the internal textures of the veins in the Kearney zone have been mapped in detail by Galantas, it is evident that the vein zones are assembled of relatively thick pods (up to 3\u00a0m) of massive sulphide and quartz breccia that are enveloped and connected by thinner (0.1\u20131\u00a0m) veins and zones of black clay-rich fault-gouge (Fig. 10). The mineralised pods are mapped to occur every 55\u201365\u00a0m along the strike of the Kearney vein underground (Fig. 10B). There are subtle differences in the strike of these two internal vein components: with the N\u2013S-striking mineralised pods striking slightly clockwise (179\u00b0\u2013359\u00b0) of the NW to NNW-striking black clay-rich fault-gouge veins (161\u00b0\u2013341\u00b0) (Figs. 10 and 13A). In the McCombs vein within the Kerr vein array, and in the Kearney vein underground, this produces an internal low amplitude, right-stepping geometry (Fig. 10). Unfortunately, the host rock foliation has not been mapped underground or in the Kerr exploration trenches to assess how this interacts with the different vein components.\nLike the veins in the Kearney zone, the veins in the Creevan zone are strongly deformed, and internally comprise of mineralised quartz pods and veins that are contained within a broader and complex zone of fault-gouge and alteration (e.g., Fig. 11A). It does appear, however, that the textures and kinematics of the Creevan veins change with structural orientation from WNW to NNE-striking (Fig. 13D). The major veins can be internally imbricated by late reverse shears which strike in the same WNW to NW-strike trend (detailed in next section), most evident at the Discovery vein outcropping along Creevan Burn and in the Sharkey vein trench map produced by RioFinex (Figs. 7H and 11E). The veins also appear to drag the foliation in a dextral sense, although no marker horizons are mapped to confirm this is the true shear sense along the structures (e.g., Fig. 11E). Like in the Kearney zone, an abrupt z-shaped buckle is recorded in the NW\u2013SE-striking portions of the strongly deformed Sharkey vein (Fig. 11C). Arrays of mm-wide veinlets striking NNE\u2013SSW (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) appear to record WNW\u2013ESE (120\u00b0\u2013300\u00b0) dilational opening vectors in the Sharkey vein trench (Fig. 11E and 11F). Unlike the major veins in both the Kearney and Creevan zones, these subvertical veinlets strike at a relatively low angle to the strike of the host rock foliation (\u223c10\u00b0\u201320\u00b0) (Figs. 11F and 13D). These veinlets have been observed to cross-cut the major Creevan veins and alteration envelopes in the field and host disseminated pyrite and galena.\n\n\n5.3\nCavanacaw syn-mineralisation structures\nFaults that can be sulphide-bearing and auriferous are observed in both the Kearney and Creevan zones. This was perhaps most clearly illustrated in the northern Kearney exploration trench (Fig. 9). Here, a population of WNW to N-striking faults with variable, mostly NE-ward dips were observed to interact with the Kearney vein (Figs. 9 and 13G). The faults relate to the Luis Shear Zone in the north of the Kearney vein (Fig. 6A), but they swing from a NW\u2013SE-dominated trend outside the vein, to an NNW\u2013SSE-dominated and within the vein (Fig. 9D site 6). Many of the faults within the vein are intensely mineralised by sulphides (Fig. 9B site 2, 9D site 7 and 8), indicating that at least the sulphide-bearing faults propagated during the mineralisation; however, some may have been reactivated post-mineralisation as they can displace the subvertical vein in a dextral sense by up to 1\u00a0m in the north of the trench (Fig. 9D, site 6). Minor, shallower dipping faults with limited extent can branch from the steep NW to N-striking faults (especially in the NW trend) (Fig. 9D site 8, 13G). These can also be sulphide-bearing, although rarely. The kinematics of these shallow faults is unknown; however, it is notable that the Kearney vein is transected and \u2018stacks up\u2019 along faults in this orientation in the centre of the trench, implying reverse kinematic movement (Fig. 9C site 5). Mineralised and unmineralised joints which dominantly strike NNW\u2013SSE and dip steeply are also found across the northern Kearney exploration trench (Fig. 13C).\nIn the Creevan zone, the Discovery vein exposed along Creevan Burn is internally stacked along NW to WNW-striking and shallowly dipping reverse shears (Fig. 7H). Reverse shears in this orientation are also found in the Sharkey vein trench where they entrain the vein to produce flat lying \u2018slabs\u2019 of mineralised vein (Fig. 11E). In both cases, these hangingwall-to-SW to SSW reverse movements are relatively late in respect to the propagation of the veins (Figs. 7H and 11E), although, like similar shallowly dipping faults in the Kearney zone, these faults can also be sulphide-bearing with exploration trench maps uncovering and recording highly altered and auriferous examples (e.g., Alberts vein in Fig. 11D). On average, this composite fault population strikes NW\u2013SE (146\u00b0\u2013326\u00b0) and dips moderately to steeply (58\u00b0) towards the NE across both the Kearney and Creevan zones (Table 1; Fig. 13G).\n\n\n5.4\nCavanacaw post-mineralisation faults\nFaults that are barren and clearly cross-cut and displace the mineralised veins are observed in both the Kearney and Creevan zones. In the Creevan zone, a series of NE to ENE-striking (058\u00b0\u2013238\u00b0) and steeply (68\u00b0) NW to NNW-dipping faults, i.e., parallel to the Lack Shear Zone, displace the veins (Fig. 13H). This fault population is best evidenced in the Sharkey vein trench where these brittle faults displace the veins in a sinistral sense by up to 4\u00a0m (Fig. 11E). Along the Creevan Burn stream section, foliation drag further indicates that these faults may have been reactivated dextrally following the earlier phase of sinistral movement.\nIn both the Kearney and Creevan zones a population of reverse shears which strike NE\u2013SW (045\u00b0\u2013225\u00b0) and dip shallowly towards the NW (33\u00b0) cross-cut and entrain the mineralised veins (Figs. 8 and 9A site 1, 13I). When observed, they are typically discreet structures (cm-scale width) that branch from and exploit the penetrative foliation in the host rock. The thrusts produce shear bands within the foliation indicative of a component of dextral movement. These thrusts appear to be responsible for the tectonic repetition created in the Discovery zone (detailed in section 5.1.), with the strongly deformed, shallow NW to WNW-dipping graphitic pelite interval also entraining and dissecting the Discovery vein (Fig. 8).\nFinally, a series of WNW\u2013ESE-striking (118\u00b0\u2013298\u00b0), moderately to vertically (62\u00b0) NNE-dipping faults that displace the subvertical Kearney vein branches by up to 1\u00a0m in a dextral sense are observed in the central portion of the northern Kearney exploration trench (Fig. 9C, site 3 and 4; 13F). These faults have also been observed in the walls of the open excavation pit where they also have a normal component of movement evidenced by displaced marker host rock horizons. No examples of these faults have been observed in the Creevan zone.\n\n\n5.5\nRegional veins\nTo the east-northeast of the Cavanacaw site, several in-situ auriferous quartz veins outcrop north and east of Omagh town along the Rylagh, Erganagh, Glencurry, Glenhordial, and Mullaghcarn Burn stream sections (Fig. 3). These \u2018regional\u2019 veins typically outcrop in the banks of poorly exposed stream sections and vary in width from mm-thick veinlets to 0.5\u00a0m (e.g., Fig. 12\n\n\n). The regional veins have strikes ranging from NNE to NW with an average of 178\u00b0\u2013358\u00b0, and average dips of 74\u00b0 towards either east or west (Fig. 13K). All the regional veins observed cross-cut the NNE\u2013SSW-striking (029\u00b0\u2013209\u00b0) and moderately (41\u00b0) WNW-dipping limb of the West Sperrin Knee Bend, although the relative angles in which these veins strike in respect to the strike of the host rock foliation does vary (Fig. 13K and 13L). The thicker veins, such as the N\u2013S-striking Rylagh vein, clearly strike at a relatively high angle of \u223c45\u00b0 to the host rock foliation (Fig. 12). Many regional veins that strike NW\u2013SE at relatively high angles to the host rock fabric are also internally thrusted and strongly deformed, as is observed at Cavanacaw (Fig. 13K). In slight contrast to the thicker regional veins, mm to cm-wide sulphide-bearing veinlets observed along the Glenhordial and Rylagh Burn stream sections typically strike NNE\u2013SSW at a relatively low angle (\u223c10\u00b0\u201320\u00b0) to the host rock fabric (Fig. 13K and 13L). As in the Creevan zone, these subvertical veinlets are recorded in the field to have dilational WNW\u2013ESE (\u223c120\u2013300\u00b0) opening vectors from quartz growth crystals and offset markers. Sericite alteration of the host rock is also typically found in the zones of dilational veining. Although exposure is poor, later faults are occasionally found to interact and displace the regional veins, similarly to the Cavanacaw area (Fig. 12). Low angle reverse shears, which share geometric and kinematic similarities to the post-mineralisation, shallow NW-dipping reverse shears observed at Cavanacaw, are observed in the banks of the poorly exposed streams.\n\n\n\n6\nInterpretation: Structural evolution of the Cavanacaw site\nUsing the observations of geometries, kinematics, cross-cutting relationships, and textures, a deformation sequence has been established for the vein and fault systems observed at the Cavanacaw site (Fig. 14). The host rock lithologies and structural fabrics observed are consistent with the area being located on the overturned limb of the thrusted Sperrin Nappe, therefore, the Grampian event of ductile deformation is not discussed here (instead, refer to Alsop and Hutton, 1993a; 1993b).\n\n6.1\nA progressive model for the Cavanacaw vein system\nAs detailed below, the structural observations of the Cavanacaw vein system are compatible with progressive sinistral transpression which, therefore, may relate to either the Scandian or Acadian events of the Caledonian orogeny (Fig. 14A and 14B). Several transcurrent ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults that bound the Cavanacaw deposit and transect the Lack Inlier could have accommodated this sinistral transpression (such as the Cool Fault and Sperrin Fault to the NNW and the Lack Shear Zone and Omagh Thrust\u2013Castle Archdale Fault complex to the SSE; Fig. 5).\nThe mineralised veins have variable orientations, textures, and kinematics that are compatible with overall progressive deformation within a sinistral shear zone system (Fig. 15\n). Two main styles of sulphide-bearing veins are observed: (1) Veins that currently strike between N and WNW, show significant asymmetric buckling, dextral shearing, and reverse faulting, particularly in the Creevan zone. Veins in this orientation cross-cut a host rock fabric that is correspondingly rotated anticlockwise with respect to the average orientation of the host rock fabric in the Lack Inlier; and (2) NNE\u2013SSW-striking veins and veinlets showing more dilational textures with little or no shearing and buckling. The undeformed veins cross-cut the deformed veins and rotated host rock fabrics and must, therefore, be relatively younger. The orientation of these undeformed dilation-dominated veins is compatible with the interpretation of an overall NNE\u2013SSW-orientated \u03c31 (Fig. 14A).\nWe propose that all the veins initially formed in a tensile mode in response to an overall NNE\u2013SSW-orientated \u03c31 (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) at an angle of \u223c45\u00b0 to the shear zone margins (075\u00b0\u2013255\u00b0) (Fig. 15). This is best supported by rotating the strike of the host rock fabrics that the deformed Cavanacaw veins cross-cut back to the regional ENE\u2013WSW strike (i.e., shear zone parallel) as it respectively rotates the strike of the veins back to \u223cNNE\u2013SSW (Fig. 15, cf. Fig. 1). The z-shaped (dextral-asymmetric) buckling geometries of the deformed veins is compatible with them having originally formed in this orientation and being progressively rotated into their current position (Fig. 15). The buckling indicates that the veins were accommodating shortening along the vein axes and antithetic (i.e., dextral) counter-shearing. Buckles with an asymmetry in the opposite sense to the overall shear direction are well documented in quartz veins that form in progressive shear zone systems (Fig. 1C) (e.g., Ghosh, 1966; Mawer, 1992; Harris, 2003; Lloyd, 2020).\nWe have not observed veins with intermediate strikes between NNE and N (Figs. 14 and 15). This potentially indicates that propagation of the veins was episodic during rotation rather than continuous (i.e., Fig. 1B and 1C rather than 1A). We explain this through the interplay between rotation, stretching and competence. Only once the quartz veins and their silicified alteration halos, which are rheologically more competent than the surrounding unaltered metasediments, were rotated into the orientation of maximum stretch (i.e., perpendicular to the \u03c31 axis), could a new set of dilational veins form; this is best seen in the Creevan zone (Fig. 15). Our progressive model allows the veins at Cavanacaw to dilate at different times relative to each other but, overall, within the same deformation phase rather than two separate events.\nIn detail, the relative motions are reflected within the deformed veins that show pinch-and-swell geometries, with quartz-rich sulphide-mineralised pods delimited by layers and shears of intensely deformed clay-rich fault-gouge. The pods are systematically orientated slightly clockwise with respect to the shears (e.g., Figs. 10 and 13A). This is compatible with the enclosing, right-stepping shears preferentially accommodating the bulk of the counter-shearing during the rotation. In contrast, the more competent pods appear to have buckled during rotation. Although the broad geometry of the swollen pods and pinched gouge veins could mistakenly be interpreted as stretching and boudinage, their spatial association with the z-shaped buckling suggests shortening, not extension.\nThe veins and host rock fabrics in the Creevan zone experienced the greatest degree of anticlockwise rotation (Figs. 8, 13D, 13E, and 15). The rotation is particularly strong at the Sharkey and Princes veins at the southern margin of the Lack Shear Zone (Figs. 6A, 11A, 11C, and 11E). The greater degrees of anticlockwise rotation have orientated the Creevan veins perpendicular to the \u03c31 axis, resulting in the veins showing both later compressional structures (internal imbrication; e.g., in the Discovery vein; Fig. 14A, 14B, and 15) and late dilational veins (e.g., in the Sharkey vein zone; Figs. 11E and 14A). The late structures are associated with the mineralisation as they can be individually sulphide- and gold-bearing and highly altered (Fig. 11D). The Creevan zone is located near the southern margin of the Lack Shear Zone (Fig. 6A). This shear zone must, therefore, have been active during the transpression, accommodating sinistral motion and the rotation within the southern part of the Lack Inlier. The less competent graphitic pelites at the contact between the Mullaghcarn Formation and the Glengawna Formation, probably played an important role in the localisation of strain (Fig. 5).\nThe overall stress field orientation (Fig. 14B) is further constrained by late strike-slip faults across the Lack Inlier. NW to NNW-striking, steeply dipping faults in the Kearney zone appear to have been reactivated in a brittle dextral sense, compatible with them being antithetic Riedel faults which moved late within the overall shear zone system (Fig. 9D site 6; 14B). A series of brittle, steep, ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults that displace the Creevan veins in a sinistral sense are also compatible with being synthetic Riedel faults in the overall shear zone system (Fig. 14B). These faults strike parallel to and are kinematically compatible with the Lack Shear Zone (Figs. 14B and 15).\nIn summary, according to our model the Cavanacaw vein system was initiated with mineralised, subvertical tensional veins forming in a \u223cNNE\u2013SSW-orientation within a progressive, ENE\u2013WSW-striking simple sinistral shear zone system; they were then passively rotated, while internally deforming through counter-shearing (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 15). Our observations and the model explain the formation of the metallic mineralisation with complex vein geometries within a single, progressive episode without the need to evoke separate deformation events.\n\n\n6.2\nCarboniferous structures\nThe brittle structures that do not fit the kinematic model related to sinistral transpression, and cross-cut some of the Cavanacaw veins, are evidence of a later episode of deformation. The deformation seems to have reactivated some of the pre-existing structures: e.g., at the Creevan Burn stream section where foliation drag indicates dextral reactivation of some of the ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults which record earlier sinistral movement. This phase also created new structures: e.g., in the Creevan zone this is manifested as shallow NW-dipping, unmineralised reverse shears (top-to-SE) that displace the earlier structures (e.g., the Discovery vein) and create the thrusted tectonic repetitions in the stratigraphy by exploiting graphitic pelites (Fig. 8). The kinematics associated with both the dextral reactivation of the ENE\u2013WSW-striking faults and the top-to-SE directed reverse shears is compatible with a switch back to broadly WNW\u2013ESE-directed compression and shortening, probably due to the peripheral effects of the Variscan (Hercynian) Orogeny (Figs. 4 and 14C; Mitchell, 2004). The reverse shears are also expressed regionally and at Curraghinalt (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000; Shaw et al., in prep). Our interpretation of a Variscan deformation phase is compatible with the published age data from low angle reverse shear clay-rich fault-gouge collected along the Lack Shear Zone and regionally (K\u2013Ar model ages of 327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma) (Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., 2000).\nIn addition to the described structures, steep WNW\u2013ESE-striking normal-dextral transtensional faults displace the Kearney vein (e.g., Fig. 9C sites 3 and 4). Their orientations may be compatible with the extensional, orogen-oblique component of the broadly WNW\u2013ESE-directed Variscan compressional regime (Fig. 14C) or the later Carboniferous extensional event that also created e.g., the c. WNW\u2013ESE-striking Newtownstewart Basin half-graben (Fig. 3); but further data is needed to better constrain these structures and their significance.\nThe structures associated with the late deformation are not auriferous or sulphide-bearing (excluding where earlier sulphide-bearing veins are locally entrained). Therefore, it seems unlikely that Carboniferous gold mineralisation, whether local remobilisation or the introduction of new gold, occurred at Cavanacaw as proposed by Earls et al. (1996) and Parnell et al. (2000).\n\n\n\n7\nRegional model and discussion\nFrom the interpretations outlined above, we have demonstrated that the Cavanacaw vein system initiated and was rotated within a progressive NE to ENE-striking sinistral shear zone system that was governed by an NNE\u2013SSW-orientated \u03c31 related to the Scandian or Acadian event (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 15) (Soper et al., 1992; Dewey and Strachan, 2003). From this, and the regional analysis presented (e.g., Fig. 13J, 13K, and 13L), we further suggest that the West Sperrin Knee Bend found to the north of Cavanacaw also formed simultaneously. The geometry of the West Sperrin Knee Bend is remarkably like the Creevan swing found locally at the south of Cavanacaw (Fig. 8). The regional, anticlockwise rotation of the foliation across the Newtownstewart region is compatible with progressive sinistral shearing within an overall NE to ENE-striking shear zone system; specifically, between the shear zone pair defined by the Pettigoe Fault and the Sperrin Fault\u2013Cool Fault system (Figs. 3 and 17). A mid-Silurian (U\u2013Pb zircon age of 426.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85\u00a0Ma; Cooper et al., 2013) minor calc-alkaline intrusive suite, \u201cthe Sperrin Mountains Suite\u201d, is spatially associated with the West Sperrin Knee Bend (Fig. 16\n\n). Cooper et al. (2013) documents that the orientation of the Sperrin Mountains Suite mainly reflects that of the country rock on the rotated NNE\u2013SSW-striking (029\u00b0\u2013209\u00b0) limb of the West Sperrin Knee Bend (see also e.g., GSNI 2007a; 2007b, 2008, and 2013). This is compatible with magma intrusion into the tensional domain (030\u00b0\u2013210\u00b0) of the overall stress system (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 17). The dating and the setting of the Sperrin Mountains Suite imply that the formation of the West Sperrin Knee Bend and, by implication, the Cavanacaw deposit was largely complete by the mid-Silurian and are therefore, Scandian structures rather than Acadian (c. 427 Ma) (Fig. 16). As there are indications of \u2018head on\u2019 Scandian NW-SE compression in the Dalradian Supergroup at c. 437 Ma in the north of Ireland, the West Sperrin Knee Bend and the Cavanacaw deposit must have formed after this (Alsop, 1996; Kirkland et al., 2013). It is interesting to note that the age of the Sperrin Mountains suite overlaps with the reactivated fault movements dated at the nearby Curraghinalt deposit (40Ar\/39Ar sericite age of 424.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\/3.6\u00a0Ma; Fig. 16; Rice et al., 2016). The Sperrin Mountains Suite age is also broadly similar to the age of the Tullagh Point Granite, northern Donegal, interpreted to be associated with a phase of relatively ductile sinistral shearing (U\u2013Th\u2013Pb zircon age of 422\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma; Fig. 16; Kirkland et al., 2008). In addition to the geochronological constraints outlined above, the relatively \u2018late\u2019 timing of the Sperrin Knee Bend during the Caledonian orogeny is further supported by: (1) the lack of any cross-cutting structures or fabrics compatible with Grampian deformation; and (2) the absence of any sedimentation patterns or facies changes to imply the structure has an even earlier, pre-Caledonian origin (both observations are also noted by Earls et al., 1996).\nAs with the Cavanacaw veins, it appears that the propagation of the auriferous quartz veins hosted within the West Sperrin Knee Bend (e.g., Rylagh, Glenhordial) occurred simultaneously with the anticlockwise rotation of the Dalradian rocks during overall sinistral shearing (Figs. 15 and 17). This is best evidenced by the relative angles in which the subvertical gold veins strike in respect to the rotated NNE\u2013SSW-striking strata (Fig. 13K and 13L). For example, the major Rylagh vein currently strikes broadly N to NNW at a relatively high angle (\u223c45\u00b0) to NNE\u2013SSW-striking foliation (Fig. 12). If the strike of the foliation along Rylagh is restored clockwise to the regional ENE\u2013WSW-trend, this would reorientate the strike of the vein to NNE\u2013SSW, which is parallel to \u03c31 interpreted at Cavanacaw and consistent with the vein initiating as a tensional fracture (e.g., Fig. 14A, 14B, 15, and 17). This further implies that the propagation of the main Rylagh vein occurred prior to, or in the early stages, of the passive rotation and the formation of the West Sperrin Knee Bend (Fig. 17). In contrast to this, the dilational veinlet arrays observed along Glenhordial and Rylagh Burn strike NNE\u2013SSW at a relatively low angle (\u223c10\u201320\u00b0) to the Dalradian strata. The vein orientation here is parallel to the modelled \u03c31 \u2013 \u03c32 plane at Cavanacaw and implies that the propagation of the sulphidic veinlets occurred after, or during the final stages, of West Sperrin Knee Bend formation (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 17). Regardless of their relative timings, both vein systems are broadly compatible with the progressive deformation model presented in this paper, and are likely to be coeval with Cavanacaw, i.e., mid-Silurian.\nRather than invoking an enigmatic and poorly constrained \u201cOmagh Lineament\u201d, we instead attribute the formation of the West Sperrin Knee Bend to spatial heterogeneities in the physical properties of the overriding Sperrin Nappe as it was accommodating orogen-parallel, sinistral shearing (Fig. 17). To the southwest of the West Sperrin Knee Bend, the inverted Upper Dalradian cover rocks of west Tyrone and south Donegal are juxtaposed against the pre-Caledonian basement gneiss of the Lough Derg and Ox Mountains Inliers (Figs. 2 and 17). In contrast to the amphibolite-facies Dalradian cover sequence, the rocks of the inliers have experienced granulite facies metamorphism and were exhumed from the lower crust (Max and Long, 1985; Sanders et al., 1987; Cooper and Johnston, 2004). From this, we suggest that the Lough Derg\u2013Ox Mountain Inlier block was relatively rigid and acted as a 'buttress' to the Dalradian cover rocks to the northeast as they were accommodating margin-parallel, sinistral shearing during the Scandian event (i.e., the \u2018buttress effect\u2019 after Beck et al., 1993) (Fig. 17). In this model, the outboard sliver of Dalradian rocks will have \u2018locked up\u2019 against the buttress and subsequently folded through the anticlockwise rotation of the strata, forming the West Sperrin Knee Bend across the Newtownstewart region (Fig. 17). The West Sperrin Knee Bend does not extend southeast of the Glengawna Formation\/Sperrin Fault and the Cool Fault into the Mullaghcarn Formation and Lack Inlier, with only local rotation found in these zones (e.g., across the Lack Shear Zone) (e.g., Fig. 17). We interpret that the strongly deformed graphitic pelitic rocks that largely define the Glengawna Formation\/Sperrin Fault and the Cool Fault may have, therefore, acted as a d\u00e9collement (Fig. 17). This accounts for why the late\/post-Grampian Curraghinalt deposit, which is largely hosted by the Mullaghcarn Formation structurally below the Glengawna Formation d\u00e9collement, does not appear to have experienced significant mid-Silurian structural reactivation or to have been rotated anticlockwise following its initiation (Rice et al., 2016; Shaw et al., in prep). To the northwest, the West Sperrin Knee Bend is further bounded by the Pettigoe Fault, which separates the structure from Grampian fold complexes farther northwest such as the Ballybofey Nappe (Alsop, 1992; 1994). Together, the ENE-WSW-striking and NNW-dipping Glengawna \u2013 Cool Fault \u2013 Sperrin Fault complex, with the NE\u2013SW-striking and SE-dipping Pettigoe Fault, form a pinch point at the northern end of Lough Erne, and define a wedge in which the West Sperrin Knee Bend could form (Fig. 17). It is notable that this \u2018pinch point\u2019 is bounded by the Lough Derg Inlier to the northwest and the Dromore High bouguer anomaly to the southeast, indicating that the \u2018pinching\u2019 geometry of the Caledonoid faults could potentially have been controlled by pre-existing and underlying structures and\/or rigid blocks (Figs. 3 and 17).\nThe interpretation that the West Sperrin Knee Bend formed during the Scandian event implies that not all the strain associated with the event was compartmented as sinistral strike-slip movement along orogen-parallel faults with little deformation between the faults, as previously assumed by e.g., Soper et al. (1992), Dewey and Strachan (2003), Chew and Strachan (2014). Instead, the West Sperrin Knee Bend indicates regional ductile deformation of this age in the Grampian Terrane of Ireland and Scotland (Fig. 17). The West Sperrin Knee Bend does exhibit remarkable geometric similarities to regional strike swings mapped in the Dalradian Supergroup rocks of Scotland: the most prominent of these is a 20\u00a0km-amplitude, s-shaped \u2018knee bend\u2019 mapped in the Dalradian strata between Braemar and Tomintoul in Aberdeenshire, northeastern Scotland (Stephenson and Gould, 1995; Stephenson et al., 2013). Like the West Sperrin Knee Bend, this major feature has also been interpreted to be relatively \u2018late\u2019 as it is not clearly associated with any minor folds or axial planar cleavages (Stephenson et al., 2013). Another \u2018knee bend\u2019 feature is a less abrupt strike swing that is mapped in the Dalradian rocks of southwest Argyll in western Scotland. Like the West Sperrin Knee Bend, this strike swing has also been historically attributed to an enigmatic and deep-seated, NNE\u2013SSW-striking crustal lineament (the \u2018Argyll Lineament\u2019) (Hutton and Alsop, 1996). Future work is needed to assess whether these regional strike swings in the Dalradian rocks of Scotland can also be accounted for by regional progressive rotation during Scandian sinistral transpression.\n\n\n8\nImplications for the evolution and metallogeny of the Grampian Terrane\nThe indirect dating of the West Sperrin Knee Bend and the gold-sulphide mineralisation through field relationship and age data from the Sperrin Mountains Suite, combined with the stress field and deformation model for all the discussed veins, strongly supports a mid-Silurian Scandian event age for most of the gold mineralisation in the western Sperrin Mountains (Fig. 14A, 14B, 15, 16, and 17). The Sperrin Mountains Suite age (c. 426.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85\u00a0Ma; Cooper et al., 2013) and the overall deformation style and compressional structures in all vein systems suggest that the deformation within the Grampian Terrane was transpressional during mid-Silurian (Fig. 14A, 14B, and 18\n). This is compatible with prevailing models which suggest that sinistral Scandian transpression in the Grampian Terrane began in the mid-Silurian (c. 430\u2013410\u00a0Ma; e.g., Soper et al., 1992) and was followed by an episode of sinistral transtension in Early Devonian (c. 410\u2013395\u00a0Ma; e.g., Dewey and Strachan, 2003; Cooper et al., 2016). Early Devonian ages have been obtained from Cononish and Rhynie in the Grampian Terrane of Scotland (Treagus et al., 1999; Mark et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2012); therefore, they seem to be 10\u201320\u00a0Ma younger than the west Sperrin Mountains gold mineralisation and temporally associated with the onset of regional sinistral transtension (Fig. 16). Although Treagus et al. (1999) favoured a transtensional model for Cononish, Tanner (2012, 2014) suggests that the structures at Cononish are more compatible with a broadly N\u2013S-orientated transpressional stress field, with the broader Cononish vein system further associated with the Periclinal Orchy Dome; a transpressional structure (Fig. 18). It is, therefore, still unclear whether the Cononish vein system formed under transpression or transtension. Regardless of this, both Cavanacaw and Cononish are considerably younger than the Late Ordovician mineralisation age at Curraghinalt (Fig. 16; Rice et al., 2016), which is associated with the late to post-orogenic stages of the Grampian event (Shaw et al., in prep).\nSeveral other auriferous and polymetallic vein systems with remarkably consistent orientations occur throughout the Laurentian Caledonides of Ireland and Scotland (Figs. 2 and 18): broadly N\u2013S-striking vein systems have been identified at Calliachar \u2013 Urlar and Coire Buidhe near Loch Tay, Scotland (Pattrick, 1984; Ixer et al., 1997), Croagh Patrick and Bohaun in western Ireland (Johnston and McCaffrey, 1996; Aherne et al., 1992; Wilkinson and Johnston, 1996; Lusty et al., 2011), and Clontibret and Clay Lake in central Ireland (Steed and Morris, 1997). Although comprehensive textural data is lacking to determine the orientation of vein dilation, the structures related to these vein systems imply that they are hosted by NW to NE-striking second-order Riedel, Antithetic-Riedel, and tensile fractures, which like Cavanacaw and Cononish, have kinematic frameworks compatible with overall NE to ENE-striking sinistral shearing and a broadly N to NNE-trending \u03c31\/\u03c32 (Fig. 18) (Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018). Radiometric age data is still lacking from these veins, but their orientations and cross-cutting relationships with surrounding rocks are compatible with either Scandian transpression or late-to post-Scandian transtension, but not with Ordovician structures as with Curraghinalt (Tanner, 2014; Rice et al., 2018).\nThe implication from our model combined with data from other vein localities is that at least three gold-mineralising episodes, each associated with a specific tectonic and structural setting, occurred across the Grampian Terrane during the overall Caledonian orogeny (Fig. 16). The first episode during which the Curraghinalt deposit formed is confined within a 10\u00a0Ma episode in the Late Ordovician (c. 463\u2013453\u00a0Ma; Rice et al., 2016). The tectonic context at this time seems to have been orogen-oblique dextral transtension due to late-to post-Grampian relaxation of the thickened crust (Shaw et al., in prep). The present study constrains the second mineralising episode with the progressive formation of the Cavanacaw deposit, as well as other nearby gold vein occurrences (e.g., Rylagh, Glenhordial), to a relatively ductile episode of ENE\u2013WSW-striking sinistral transpression during the Scandian event, probably in the mid-Silurian (c. 430\u2013425\u00a0Ma; Fig. 16). The third episode, so far only dated in Scotland, seems to be 10\u201320\u00a0Ma younger than the \u201cCavanacaw phase\u201d and may to be associated with an episode of brittle sinistral transpression or transtension along Caledonian faults during the late- to post-Scandian event in the Early Devonian.\nFurther work is needed to determine whether the other, un-dated vein systems with similar structural architectures to Cavanacaw and Cononish are related to a mid-Silurian event (\u201cthe Cavanacaw phase\u201d) or an Early Devonian event (\u201cthe Cononish phase\u201d) in the Scandian. The age information, combined with structural data, across the Grampian Terrane could be very useful in targeting metallogenic vein exploration; but additional age data would also further help to constrain the tectonic evolution of the Grampian Terrane in Ireland and Scotland and the localisation of deformation and fluid flow during the later stages of the Caledonian Orogeny.\n\n\n9\nConclusions\n\n\n\n1.\nThe propagation and mineralisation of the economic, structurally complex vein system at Cavanacaw can be explained by a single progressive kinematic model. Rather than linking to two-stage deformation caused by NW\u2013SE-directed Ordovician, then Carboniferous, compression, the formation of the vein system can be more easily explained via progressive deformation and sinistral transpressional shearing along ENE\u2013WSW-striking transcurrent deformation zones. Comparison with regional data strongly suggests mid-Silurian age for this progressive deformation, linking it to the Scandian event of the Caledonian orogeny. All the sulphide-bearing structures in the complexly deformed veins at Cavanacaw and nearby regional localities can be readily explained by our progressive model.\n\n\n2.\nThe progressive deformation recognised at Cavanacaw may further explain both the occurrence of other metalliferous veins in the Sperrins (except Curraghinalt) and the formation of the regionally significant \u2018West Sperrin Knee Bend\u2019 which has historically been associated with the enigmatic Omagh Lineament. The formation of the regional structure and the structural observations from the veins are compatible with the anticlockwise rotation of the Dalradian strata expected within an ENE\u2013WSW-striking sinistral shear zone system. The age of a calc-alkaline intrusive Sperrin Mountains Suite dated by Cooper et al. (2013), that appear to have been intruded within the tensional domain of this shear zone system, is mid-Silurian and constrains the evolution of the shear zone system associated with the Cavanacaw and other metalliferous veins to c. 430\u2013425\u00a0Ma. Overall, the West Sperrin Knee Bend and similar structures in Scotland may be proof of penetrative Scandian deformation in the Grampian Terrane of Ireland and Scotland.\n\n\n3.\nThe interpretations suggest that three mineralising episodes, each associated with a specific tectonic and structural setting, occurred across the Grampian Terrane during the overall Caledonian orogeny. The Cavanacaw deposit is younger (mid-Silurian) than the nearby world-class Curraghinalt deposit (Ordovician); but probably up to 10\u201320\u00a0Ma older than the Early Devonian Cononish deposit and Rhynie gold occurrence in Scotland. The latter two probably formed during a later phase of brittle Scandian transpression or during a switch to transtension. The stress and kinematic regime inferred to be responsible for the veins at Cavanacaw do share similarities with Cononish and with other, un-dated but broadly \u201cLate Caledonian\u201d sulphide veins in the Grampian Terrane of Scotland and Ireland (Loch Tay area; Croagh Patrick; and Clontibret \u2013 Clay Lake) but more data, particularly age data, are needed from all vein systems to further investigate the localisation of deformation and fluid flow within the Grampian Terrane during the Silurian and Devonian.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor statement\nShaw JI: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Validation; Visualization; Roles\/Writing - original draft, Torvela T: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing, Cooper MR: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing, Leslie AG: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing, Chapman RJ: Investigation; Supervision; Writing - review & editing.\n\n","47":"","48":"","49":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nBoudinage is the periodic failure \u2013 brittle or ductile \u2013 of competent layers in a mechanically layered material under coupled layer-parallel extension (e.g. Ramberg, 1955; Goscombe et al., 2004). For a discussion of definition of nomenclature see Urai et al. (2001) and Kenis et al. (2004, 2005). Boudins provide a rich archive to understand the deformation history in the mechanically layered crust. First, boudins occur on all scales, from crustal-scale extension forming island chains (Jolivet et al., 2004), to km-scale boudins in thick layers (Strozyk et al., 2014), down to boudinage of brittle grains in ductile rocks. Second, their geometry depends on paleo-rheology, strain history, and initial geometry (\nRamberg, 1955; Ramsay, 1968;Ramsay and Huber, 1983, 1987; Kenis et al., 2005\n). The importance of boudins for understanding deformation histories, as well as their geometric variability has been recognized since more than a hundred years (Ramsay, 1881\n,\n1968; Lohest, 1909; Ramberg, 1955). A unifying taxonomy has been proposed by Goscombe et al. (2004), who subdivide boudins into five end members, in particular: ductile drawn boudins (also known as pinch-and-swell), brittle torn boudins separated by extensional (mode 1) fractures, bookshelf-rotated domino boudins separated by straight antithetic shear fractures, or gash boudins separated by sigmoidal or forked shear veins and fractures, and finally shearband boudins resulting from synthetic shearing. Our understanding of the mechanisms controlling boudinage and the resulting geometries has greatly improved in the past two decades, especially through analogue and numerical modelling. Analogue models (Zulauf and Zulauf, 2005, Zulauf et al., 2020a, b) and numerical models (Abe et al., 2013\n;\nVirgo et al., 2013\n,\n2014\n,\n2016) reveal how complex boudin interference structures can evolve from multiphase and\/or high-strain deformation. Numerical models have also shown to be a valuable tool in exploring the rheological control on boudin geometry and internal stress distribution (Bai et al., 2000; Schmalholz et al., 2008; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011, 2017; Abe and Urai, 2012; Moulas et al., 2014). Nevertheless, we still do not fully understand the mechanics of boudin formation, especially the factors controlling boudin localisation. In this study we build on a high-resolution 3D dataset of an amphibolite layer that has experienced multiple phases of brittle and ductile boudinage (Von Hagke et al., 2018). In this dataset, a sequence of boudinage phases has been identified in combination with extensive field studies (Virgo et al., 2018). Furthermore, we showed that boudin geometry in 3D is much more complex than anticipated from 2D outcrop. Notably, the orientation and mode of inter-boudin fractures can change along strike, multiphase boudinage can lead to significant reactivation, strain recorded by boudinage is distributed heterogeneously, and the 3D dataset revealed an additional boudin set that was not obvious in the field (Von Hagke et al., 2018). These studies show that, in line with previous studies (Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011; Marques et al., 2012; Abe et al., 2013; Virgo et al., 2014; Zulauf et al., 2014), the role of structural inheritance and the effects of layer thickness on brittle boudin geometry and failure mode are still poorly understood. In this study we further investigate the effects of layer thickness on brittle boudinage. Specifically, we investigate (1) the influence of layer thickness on boudin width during polyphase deformation, (2) how layer thickness effects fracture mode during brittle boudinage, and (3) potential explanations for the correlation between layer thickness and resolved strain identified previously (Von Hagke et al., 2018). Finally, we integrate the additional boudin generations discovered in the high-resolution dataset into the exhumation and cooling history of Naxos.\n\n\n2\nBoudinage formation and geometries\nBrittle boudins evolve through sequential fracture infilling, i.e. fractures forming in between existing fractures, until the layer is saturated with fractures and a steady-state boudin width is reached, which is generally thought to depend on layer thickness, coupling between matrix and boudinaged layer, effective stress, as well as material properties of both layers, such as Young's modulus of layer and matrix, Poisson's ratio of layer and matrix, matrix viscosity, and layer tensile strength (Ramberg, 1955; Price, 1966; Mandal et al., 1994; Bai et al., 2000; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011; Marques et al., 2012). Geometrical complexity such as splay and fractures clustering in arrays (Olson, 2004; Abe and Urai, 2012) develops during the early stage of infilling, while maximum tensile stress is still heterogeneously distributed along the layer (Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011). Once saturation is reached, fracture density should correlate directly with rheology and stress state in the competent layer (Bai and Pollard, 2000b; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011; Zulauf et al., 2020a). When coupling between matrix and competent layer is strong, interfacial slip is suppressed, and stress is redistributed inside the boudins with a critical aspect ratio of about 1. At this stage, further boudin segmentation is only possible through additional weakening factors such as material defects or elevated fluid pressure (Bai et al., 2000; Bai and Pollard, 2000b; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011).\nIn order to reconstruct the full deformation history recorded in boudin structures it is crucial to investigate their geometry in three dimensions, as only sectional and map views combined can reveal the full complexity of boudin structures (Zulauf and Zulauf, 2005; Zulauf et al., 2011b, 2020a; Marques et al., 2012; Abe et al., 2013; Virgo et al., 2018; Von Hagke et al., 2018). 3D boudin analysis has shown that identifying multistage deformation with the same failure mode is in general not possible from a 2D section alone (Virgo et al., 2018; Von Hagke et al., 2018). Similarly, tablet boudins (of which chocolate tablet boudins are a subtype) formed either in one episode of pure flattening (Ghosh, 1988; Zulauf et al., 2011b), in nonplane strain (Ghosh, 1988; Abe et al., 2013), or through polyphase deformation (i.e. the classical chocolate tablet boudins, Ghosh, 1988; Zulauf et al., 2011a; Zulauf et al., 2014)\u2014these look identical in 2D sections but only reveal their deformation history in map view. Finite strain can also be underestimated when secondary reworking of boudins that have been parallelised to the instantaneous extension axis by in-plane folding goes unnoticed (Zulauf and Zulauf, 2005; Zulauf et al., 2020a).\n\n\n3\nGeological background\nThe island of Naxos, in the centre of the Aegean Sea, offers a unique opportunity to study multiphase boudinage structures in three dimensions. Marbles, mined for their clear white colour and large crystal size, are intercalated with centimetre to decimetre thick amphibolite layers and pegmatite dykes, and have undergone multiphase deformation (Schenk et al., 2007; Virgo et al., 2018). Naxos is a metamorphic core complex exhumed by a crustal-scale, N-dipping detachment with top-to-the-N sense of shear (Lister et al., 1984; Urai et al., 1990). Extensional tectonics in the back-arc basin are a manifestation of slab rollback following southward migration of early Alpine subduction in the Hellenic arc (Fytikas et al., 1984; Jolivet and Brun, 2010; Jolivet et al., 2013). The metamorphic core complex hosts a central migmatite dome subdivided in three sub-domes, with several marble enclaves and rafts in and around the high-strain zone separating the southern from the central sub-dome (Vanderhaeghe, 2004; Kruckenberg et al., 2011). Deformation structures in these marble rafts indicate multiphase E\u2013W shortening evidenced by two generations of ductile drawn boudins isoclinal folding, and five generations of brittle boudins in the amphibolite layers (Virgo et al., 2018; Von Hagke et al., 2018). The pegmatites, which intruded the marble after ductile deformation in the amphibolite, only display two generations of brittle boudins (Schenk et al., 2007). The structures within the marble rafts are shown to post-date development of similarly coupled folding and boudinage in the metasediments surrounding the migmatite dome (Urai et al., 1990; Buick, 1991; Virgo et al., 2018).\n\n\n4\nSample & methods\nWe present data from serial sectioning of a mined, wedge-shaped marble block with a height of 37\u00a0cm and face lengths of 250, 224, and 140\u00a0cm (Fig. 1 in Von Hagke et al., 2018). It contains a single boudinaged amphibolite layer with variable thickness resulting from earlier drawn boudinage, cut by brittle boudins with axes subnormal to the drawn boudins. It was recovered from the marble mine south of Kinidaros on the island of Naxos, Greece (37\u00b005\u203212.6\u2033 N, 25\u00b028\u203220.0\u2033 E), where a large marble raft from the high-strain zone subdividing the migmatite dome is mined. The exact in-situ orientation of the block is unknown, but can be constrained by comparing the boudin structures to the field data from Virgo et al. (2018): the amphibolite layer had to be vertical and striking N\u2013S. Amphibolite composition is dominated by hornblende and plagioclase, with biotite, muscovite, and minor titanite (Schenk et al., 2007).\nWe employed \u2018outcrop-scale tomography\u2019 (Von Hagke et al., 2018) to generate a 3D model of the boudinaged layer. The internal structure of the metre-sized sample is reconstructed from slices cut with an industrial diamond saw. The sample was cut into slabs perpendicular to the axes of brittle boudins, based on observations in the field. The slabs are about 2\u00a0cm thick, with a kerf loss of about 1\u00a0cm. Both faces of each slab were digitised using a Nikon D800 camera with a Nikkor Micro 60\u00a0mm f\/2.8D lens, resulting in an image resolution of 0.2 mm\/pixel and negligible distortion of 1\u00a0mm over a frame width of 1450\u00a0mm. The boudin structure was then reconstructed from the spatially referenced images in Midland Valley's (now Petroleum Experts) Move 2016 suite. In each slice (i.e. image), we mapped fault traces (classified according to failure mode), layer top and bottom, inter-boudin width (measuring dilatancy), and then correlated these across slices (Fig. 1). In total, 5087 fracture traces created a 3D network of 841 fractures planes. Details of the interpretation were tested by dissolving the marble in selected slabs using hydrochloric acid. Photogrammetry models of thus exposed amphibolite were integrated into the structural 3D model of the entire sample and confirmed our interpretation. The effects of thickness on fracture spacing, failure mode and resolved strain are quantitatively analysed in synthetic sections calculated from the 3D model and striking perpendicular to the thickness gradient of the amphibolite layer (4\u00b0 clockwise misorientation to the slices, Fig. 1). Microstructural analysis was performed using the Petroscan Virtual microscope (Virgo et al., 2016).\n\n\n5\nResults\nIn the following paragraphs, we show our observation in the reference frame of the sample, with the amphibolite layer being horizontal. Orientations in this reference frame are indicated by an asterisk (*). We note that the amphibolite layer was oriented sub-vertically with the E\u2013W* axis trending N\u2013S, as explained above.\n\n5.1\nObserved structures\nAmphibolite layer thickness varies across the sample due to early drawn boudinage. Drawn boudins are present in two generations (Virgo et al., 2018), with the older, long wavelength (l\u03bb) boudins responsible for the metre-scale thickness gradient from the long end to the short end of the sample. Their wavelength exceeds the sample width and is probably around 2\u20133\u00a0m, as observed in the field (Virgo et al., 2018). Due to their long wavelength the shape of l\u03bb boudins is not well constrained, but can be assumed to be cylindrical at the sample scale. They are overprinted by a second generation (s\u03bb) of drawn boudins, which have a wavelength of ca. 10\u201320\u00a0cm (Fig. 1). The s\u03bb boudins are not fully separated but form an anastomosing network of amphibolite interrupted by lenticular pinched-out areas of up to 1\u00a0m length and a few decimetre width (see Fig. 9, 10, 14 in Virgo et al., 2018 for additional field images).\n\nDrawn boudins are overprinted by at least five generations of brittle boudins, which can be grouped based on their orientation and continuity (Fig. 2). They are described in detail in Von Hagke et al. (2018). From oldest to youngest, these are:\nNW*: Straight continuous torn boudins with millimetre aperture, striking 122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2\u00b0*, 24 inter-boudin fracture planes. Owing to their minimal aperture, they are only sparsely identified and mapped in the 3D model, but are easily identified in etched samples (Fig. 2 in Von Hagke et al., 2018).\nNNW*: Torn \u2013 domino boudins striking 157\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.2\u00b0*, 142 inter-boudin fracture planes. Fracture planes dip 247\/83\u00b0* on average, with minimal throw and apertures below 1\u00a0mm.\nNNE*: Domino boudins striking 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00b0*, 168 inter-boudin fracture planes. Fracture planes dip 275\/60\u00b0* on average, with throws generally within 1.2\u201317.5\u00a0mm, but reaching up to 30\u00a0mm and apertures of up to 3\u00a0mm.\nN*: Torn boudins with apertures up to 3\u00a0mm striking 178\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00b0*, 417 inter-boudin fracture planes. They are the most abundant fractures in the block.\nVeins: Chlorite filled veins striking 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00b0*, frequency not recorded as they often do not form continuous planes in layer-normal direction. They are consistently protruding into the marble (i.e. thicker mechanical unit), have an aperture of 1\u20132\u00a0mm, a layer-normal length of 2\u20135\u00a0cm and a consistent spacing of 5\u201310\u00a0cm. In thick amphibolite they tend to be pinned to older, well-developed fractures.\n\nChlorite slickenfibres developed in many sheared inter-boudin zones (or fractures), recording sense of motion, dilatancy, and periodicity of deformation. Shear motion is pure dip-slip, with commonly a small extensional component (i.e. hybrid fractures). Reactivation as extensional fractures is frequent and evidenced by ruptured or new slickenfibres (Fig. 3\n). Both shear and extensional fractures are reactivated by chlorite veins in inter-boudin zones and layer-normal chlorite veins above and below shear fractures in the marble. The marble also has a lighter colour to either side of the amphibolite layer for as far as the chlorite veins protrude into it. The different boudin sets are strongly interconnected, with frequent bridging or reactivation and extension of older fractures by younger ones. Interaction between the NNW*, NNE* and N* sets is almost exclusively characterised by Y-nodes (i.e., younger boudins terminating at older boudins).\n\n\n5.2\nEffects of thickness\nThe large-scale thickness variation of the amphibolite layer originating from early drawn boudinage provides an opportunity to investigate the effect of layer thickness on brittle boudinage. Other potential controls on boudin geometry like the amphibolite's mechanical properties, grain size, deformation history as well as external factors like far-field stress (and hence marble flow) can be assumed to remain constant within the sample for any given boudin generation, leaving amphibolite thickness as the only major variable. Fracture geometry and distribution reveal three parameters correlating with layer thickness: fracture distribution, failure mode, and macroscopically resolved extension.\n\n\n5.3\nFracture spacing\nBoudin widths in the model (i.e. fracture spacing) can be analysed using two methods: A more intuitive approach is to calculate spacing from the number of fractures of each generation counted in sections that are perpendicular to the thickness gradient of the amphibolite layer (referred to as top-down approach). This has the advantage that we can calculate spacing for each boudin generation and thus observe the influence of inheritance. However, thickness-normal sections are synthetic and only contain intersections with the interpolated and classified fracture planes (grouped into generations), potentially introducing bias. These drawbacks can be circumvented by the second approach, where we directly count the mapped 2D fracture traces in the original slabs, disregarding interpolation across slabs and classification (referred to as bottom-up approach). This, however, oversimplifies the system as it does not account for finite strain rotation between different boudin generations, forcing new localisation instead of reactivation of older fractures. Also, the approach might overestimate fracture density where fractures interact or splay. Finally, since 3D fracture orientation is unknown and changes from fracture to fracture, we cannot correct the spacing calculated in the bottom-up approach for the length-overestimation resulting from measuring on non-perpendicular sections. The resulting overestimation of spacing is significant only for the low-density NW* set (88.7%) but acceptable for all other boudin sets (NNW*: 8.6%, NNE*: 0.4%, N*: 0.1%, Veins: 5.1%).\nResults from both approaches are very similar for extension fractures but less so for shear fractures (Fig. 4\n). NNE* shear fracture spacing (top-down) follows a negative power-law correlation with thickness, with an exponent of \u22120.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11 and an \n\n\nR\n2\n\n\n of 0.6. Conversely, shear fracture spacing in the bottom-up approach shows a positive correlation with thickness, like N* fractures in the top-down approach, as well as extensional and all mapped fractures in the bottom-up approach. Fitting parameters are summarised in Table 1\n. Extensional fracture spacing (N* in top-down and extensional in bottom-up) are potentially uncorrelated with layer thickness as \n\n\nR\n2\n\n\n for both fits are <0.1. The average aspect ratio of boudins (fracture spacing over layer thickness) is quite low, at 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11. This matches the qualitative observation that, at least where the amphibolite is thick, wider boudins with an aspect ratio of about 1 are separated by clusters of several fractures that are sometimes interconnected (Fig. 1). The high standard deviation of fracture spacing measured in subsets of fractures (i.e. NNE*, N*, shear, or extensional fractures) is reduced if data for shear and extensional fractures are summed up to calculate overall fracture spacing (9\u00a0mm & 16\u00a0mm vs 4\u00a0mm, respectively). This indicates that there has been reactivation. To test this, we plotted fracture spacing and amphibolite thickness along the thickness gradient (Fig. 4C). The plot reveals a striking negative spatial correlation between the two dominant boudin generations in the sample, N* (extensional) and NNE* (shear) boudins. N* fractures preferentially develop in areas with less pre-existing (NNE*) fractures. The trends of both boudin generations also shows a distinct sinuosity, not related to any measurable thickness variation, which is strongly reduced if their spacing is averaged.\n\n\n5.4\nFailure mode\nExtension in the amphibolite layer is dominantly accommodated by slip on shear fractures where the layer is thick, as opposed to dilatancy of extensional fractures where it is thin (Fig. 5\nA). This observation is corroborated by the dip vs thickness (Fig. 5B) and extension vs thickness data (Fig. 5C), both showing increasing shear dominance with increasing layer thickness. Dip angles of NNE* and NNW* inter-boudin fractures, which both have a distinct shear component, display a very similar negative correlation with thickness with an average factor of about \u22120.35\u00b0\/mm. Dip angles of the purely extensional N* and NW* fractures remain largely constant over the entire thickness range. Dip angles are used as proxies for the failure mode, with the underlying assumption that extensional fractures should develop at ca. 90\u00b0 to the layer interface and this angle decreases as the shear component of deformation increases.\n\n\n5.5\nBrittle extension\nExtension localised in brittle boudinage is either accommodated by purely layer parallel dilatancy or by heave, the layer parallel component of shear slip. Slickenfibres in the etched blocks confirm the movement between boudins to be purely dip-slip. Dilatancy is directly mapped during section interpretation and heave is the difference between finite boudin train length, boudin exterior, and dilatancy (see Von Hagke et al., 2018). Both are normalised to finite boudin train length and provide a direct approximation of finite strain accommodated by brittle boudinage (Fig. 5C). While dilatancy is essentially thickness invariant, heave correlates with thickness. As a result, their sum, total brittle extension also correlates with layer thickness, ranging from ca. 5% extension at 5\u00a0mm thickness to 16% at 32\u00a0mm. The power-law fit for heave suggests a lower boundary for the development of shear fractures around 10\u00a0mm thickness. Further, dilatancy below this thickness is exclusively accommodated by chlorite veins, which are controlled by a different mechanical unit (they extend into the marble) than the previous boudin generations. Hence, we can consider 10\u00a0mm to be the threshold below which no layer-bound fractures localise in our sample, and indeed, unless linked to a chlorite vein, we can observe deformation progressively delocalising below 10\u00a0mm layer thickness. Just below this threshold we can still observe some necks and shear zones at angles of ca. 35\u201345\u00b0 to the layer, which disappear as layer thickness approaches the grain scale (Fig. 6\nA). The correlation between fracturing and thickness is also reflected in failure mode and fracture spacing, notably the negative power-law trend of the NNE* set (Fig. 4A).\n\n\n5.6\nMicrostructure\nThin sections from thick and thin amphibolite show similar grain size distribution (plagioclase: 0.2\u20130.5\u00a0mm, amphibole: 0.3\u20131\u00a0mm), degree of crystal plastic deformation, frequency of deformation twins in plagioclase and calcite, and frequency of grain cracking. We did not measure grain size distribution (e.g., by EBSD) nor study crystal plastic deformation in the surrounding marble (this could be done using the mechanical twins which are ubiquitous): the samples are available for further study. Only two differences are apparent: The concentration of calcite and microscopic shear planes. While calcite is absent in thick parts of the amphibolite, small, disseminated pockets (which could well be calcite-filled dilatant microfractures) of up to few hundred micrometres across become more common where the layer thins. They have highly angular outlines with wall rock minerals commonly protruding into them, hinting at their secondary origin. Distributed microscopic strain is accommodated by shear planes across the entire amphibolite layer (Fig. 6B\u2013E). They are characterised by consistent alignment of grain boundaries along a single surface, concentration of small, rounded grains, biotite, and chlorite along the aligned boundaries, as well as occasional intragranular deformation, either as slip along cleavage planes, asperity removal, or crystal plastic deformation. The latter is most commonly observed as undulose extinction and subgrain boundaries in calcite grains of the marble, but can sometimes also afflict plagioclase grains. Our observations do not reveal if the grain boundary alignment is an effect of asperity abrasion on the micrometre scale or crystal-plastic processes. When abutting against larger grains, shear planes can bifurcate around the grain and reunite, or splay and continue as multiple planes. Less frequently in the amphibolite, but commonly in the coarser marble, they penetrate and terminate within a grain. Where identifiable, displacement on these planes does not exceed a few micrometres. These shear planes are abundant throughout the whole layer in thick amphibolite, irrespective of proximity to fractures. In thinner amphibolite they are only abundant in and around macroscopically identifiable sites of deformation\u2014either more localised shear bands or less localised necks. As such, they are another manifestation of brittle strain decreasing with layer thickness.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSpacing\nDue to the thickness variation from old drawn boudins, our sample provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of layer thickness on boudinage under otherwise constant conditions of temperature, pressure and far field strain rate. Results show a clear relationship between thickness and failure mode (Fig. 5) as well as total brittle extension as measured by fracture displacements (Fig. 5C). However, the relationship between layer thickness and fracture spacing is far more ambiguous as would be expected from previous studies (e.g. Mandal et al., 1994; Bai et al., 2000; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011; Marques et al., 2012). Fracture spacing in the individual boudin generations shows only weak correlation with thickness in the case of the NNE* set, but not the N* set (Fig. 4A). Moreover, spacing of NNE* fractures correlates negatively with thickness, which implies that strain is not distributed homogeneously through the boudinaged layer. The negative trend is, however, consistent with resolved strain increasing with layer thickness. The high variance in spacing of both NNE* and N* sets, and thus the weak correlation, can partly be explained by complex fracture geometries with abundant splaying and branching, as well as reactivation of pre-existing fractures being favoured in the already saturated parts of the layer. Reactivation can be expected for the low misorientation between the NNE* and the N* set, especially given the potentially high rheological contrast between incompetent marble and competent amphibolite (Virgo et al., 2014). Indeed, interaction between the NNW*, NNE* and N* sets is almost exclusively characterised by Y-nodes, suggesting that newly developing fractures readily propagated towards and merged with existing fractures. The significance of structural inheritance becomes evident when plotting spacing along a thickness section through the amphibolite (Fig. 4C), showing the alternating dominance of either the older NNE* or the younger N* set, while the average combined spacing stays relatively constant. This highlights how reactivation is an effective way to suppress further fracture nucleation where fracture density is already high (Passchier et al., 2021; Prabhakaran et al., 2021a, 2021b). The NNE* fractures were reactivated during the subsequent N* deformation, and new fractures only developed where the former were scarce. The considerably lower standard deviation of fracture spacing across all boudin generations (Fig. 4B) compared to individual boudin generations (Fig. 4A) further supports this hypothesis. Extensional fracture spacing shows no significant correlation with thickness, and spacing between shear fractures as well as between all fractures, not distinguished between fracture modes or boudin generation, follows a low-exponent power law or linear trend. Assuming a fracture infill model (Bai et al., 2000; Bai & Pollard, 2000a, 2000b), new fracture nucleation should stop as boudin aspect ratio approaches a critical value (usually around 1), and additional strain should be accommodated in the inter-boudin zones (i.e., by the fractures in our case). However, the measured boudin aspect ratio of only about 0.3 is significantly lower than the expected critical aspect ratio of ca. 1 (Bai et al., 2000), mainly due to the clustering of fractures and splays. Our boudin sections resemble the model results with high strain and interfacial friction coefficient in Fig. 4 of Sch\u00f6pfer et al. (2011). Clusters of fractures can form during the infill phase of fracturing when tensile stress is not yet bound to the boudin centre, and flaws in the direct proximity of an existing fracture can propagate through the layer or link to the existing fracture (Bai and Pollard, 2000a; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011). Our data support an overall weak correlation between fracture spacing and layer thickness, but other factors such as structural inheritance and geometrical complexity arising from fracture nucleation and propagation are more important for controlling fracture distribution during individual generations of deformation.\n\n\n6.2\nFailure mode\nThe variation in strain accommodated by ductile and brittle boudinage can be explained by differential embrittlement and viscosity increase during exhumation and cooling, as well as, in the case of brittle boudins, the geometrical constraints on failure mode arising from earlier drawn boudinage. Boudin size decreases in each consecutive boudin generation (i.e., from 24 inter-boudin fractures with negligible aperture in the early NW* generation to 178 inter-boudin fractures with \u22643\u00a0mm aperture in the late N* generation, Fig. 2). Progressive early embrittlement of the amphibolite is recorded by the decreasing boudin size from the l\u03bb (2\u20133\u00a0m wavelength) to s\u03bb (10\u201320\u00a0cm wavelength) generation and ultimately the transition from ductile to brittle boudinage. Continued viscosity increase of the marble then lead to increasing fracture density in each subsequent brittle boudin generation as the viscosity contrast between matrix and layer decreased and interfacial coupling increased (Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2011\n,\nZulauf et al., 2020a\n,\nb). Finally, the marble was embrittled at least locally when it was fractured by chlorite veins. This confirms the continuous trend of cooling and exhumation proposed in Virgo et al. (2018)\n. As a consequence, earlier localisation was more likely to develop as shear fractures (NNW* and NNE* sets) under the higher confining pressure, while the later N* and vein sets developed as extensional opening mode fractures (e.g. Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2007; Abe and Urai, 2012; Kettermann and Urai, 2015). This could be explained by the increased viscosity of the marble limiting material flow around fractures (Schueller et al., 2005), preventing significant block rotation from shear fracturing. A reduced confining stress would also explain why the chlorite veins protrude into the marble, as they could propagate into the then relatively competent marble after nucleating in the brittle amphibolite. The precipitation of chlorite veins also evidences the presence of fluids, although there is not much evidence for retrograde reactions in the amphibolite itself. However, a detailed petrographic study was not attempted in this project. A late-stage fluid pressure pulse reducing effective stress in the amphibolite and surrounding marble could have promoted fracture propagation into the marble (see also Schenk et al., 2007). Further, shear fractures in our sample preferentially localised in drawn boudins (or swells) as can be seen in Fig. 5. During the earlier NNW* boudin generation, shear fractures only developed in the northern* swell with a fairly circular cross-section (low aspect ratio), while during the later NNE* boudin generation shear fractures also developed in the more drawn out southern* swell (high aspect ratio) (Figs. 2 and 5). Mandal et al. (2001) show how tensile stress in brittle inclusions increases linearly with their aspect ratio, while compressive stress decreases, making low aspect ratio swells more likely to fail in shear while the high aspect ratio pinches fail in tension. Hence, the geometric constraints from early drawn boudinage dictated stress partitioning in later phases of brittle deformation. Shear fractures first nucleated in the swells with the lowest aspect ratio and then progressively propagated into the thinner and more drawn-out parts of the amphibolite layer.\n\n\n6.3\nStrain\nThe asymptotic increase of fracture spacing for NNE* shear fractures in thinner amphibolite (Fig. 4A) is emphasising how thinner layers could not accommodate shear fractures. However, the \u2018missing\u2019 strain was seemingly not transferred to extensional fractures either. The same trend is apparent in the rotation of fracture dip in the shear dominated NNW* and NNE* sets towards layer normal extensional fractures in thinner amphibolite, while the tensile-dominated N* and NW* sets are thickness invariant (Fig. 5B). The gradual change in orientation is distinct from the sudden changes in orientation and failure mode resulting from lateral fracture propagation by reactivation. The correlation between brittly resolved strain and thickness is further corroborated by measured macroscopic extension (Fig. 5C). Correlation of brittle extension with thickness can mainly be ascribed to the behaviour of shear fractures (Fig. 5C). However, we note that the marble has not been stretched homogenously, and we can determine local strain variations on the order of 10% at the sample scale (ca. 4.5\u00a0m2). Since below 10\u00a0mm layer thickness only chlorite veins disrupt the layer, we infer that layer-bound brittle deformation was replaced by macroscopically distributed deformation (Fig. 7\n). This transition to macroscopically distributed deformation in thin layers can also be seen in field data from Naxos, where adjacent layers of different thickness have very different fracture densities and associated macroscopic brittle extension. Fig. 7 in Virgo et al. (2018) and Fig. 4 in Schenk et al. (2007) show examples of thin amphibolite layers following the stepped boudin exterior of thicker neighbouring amphibolite layers or pegmatite dykes. These thin \u2018sidekick\u2019 layers must accommodate even more strain than their thicker neighbours but show no macroscopically localised deformation. Consequently, these layers must have accommodated extension by distributed processes as overall fracture density decreases (i.e. spacing increases). Below a thickness of ca. 10\u00a0mm, brittle deformation is limited to the chlorite veins, which are however not constrained to the amphibolite layer and were most likely controlled by a thicker mechanical unit including the lighter coloured marble directly adjacent to the amphibolite (Fig. 1). Just below the thickness threshold for brittle localisation, deformation could still \u2018localise\u2019 in cm-wide zones that manifest macroscopically by necking, but without separation. Microscopically, these zones contain abundant shear planes (Fig. 6), mostly following and aligning grain boundaries. However, these surfaces are much more abundant in thicker amphibolite, where they are not limited to the vicinity of fractures but are also common in boudin centres (Fig. 6E). Also, the deformation mechanism governing these shear planes remains elusive. They show no evidence for cataclasis, compaction, or mineral alteration. The distribution of the shear planes (clustering in necks from brittle boudinage) suggests that distributed brittle strain is also proportional to layer thickness, which means that these shear planes are not accommodating \u2018missing\u2019 extension in the pinches. Increased concentration of calcite in thin amphibolite could indicate intergranular fracturing and subsequent granular flow as a possible mechanism for distributed deformation, as described for the drawn boudins by Virgo et al. (2018). However, to preserve the high grain angularity seen in the amphibolite, considerable dilatation would have been necessary, which would require elevated fluid pressure that should have manifested in much more significant mineralisation (Stel, 1981). The absence of layer-bound fractures in very thin amphibolite is possibly an effect of intergranular fracturing (Abe and Urai, 2012; Virgo et al., 2018; Spru\u017eeniece et al., 2021) saturating the layer before cracks could coalesce into localised fractures. This is not surprising considering that the layer is thinner than the expected shear band thickness of 10\u201320 grains across (e.g. M\u00fchlhaus and Vardoulakis, 1987).\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe Naxos amphibolite boudins offer exciting insights into the evolution of a polyphase boudin system under progressively decreasing temperature and pressure. Our data reveal three unexpected effects: (1) locally, boudin width is controlled by inheritance rather than layer thickness, and (2) fracture mode as well as (3) brittly resolved extension are proportional to layer thickness. These observations are obvious when analysing boudins in 3D, but would probably remain unnoticed in a description of a typical 2D outcrop in the field. Thus, our findings also highlight the necessity for characterising such complex systems in 3D, leading to the following geometric and mechanical findings, specifically:\n\n1.\nFracture density and failure mode record the progressive cooling and embrittlement of marble and amphibolite during exhumation.\n\n\n2.\nFailure mode of brittle boudins varies with layer thickness. Shear fractures were only accommodated in swells with a low aspect ratio cross-section, while extensional fractures could also localise in pinches.\n\n\n3.\nBrittle strain delocalised with decreasing layer thickness. Below the threshold of 10\u201320 grains thickness, localised fracturing is absent and microscopic shear planes become constrained to shear zones and necks.\n\n\n4.\nAs a consequence of delocalisation, resolved strain in the boudinaged layer correlates with thickness and thin domains record less strain than thick domains. No process accommodating this \u2018missing\u2019 brittle strain could be identified. Presuming the layer stretched homogeneously, the accommodating process remains elusive.\n\n\n5.\nFinal total fracture spacing (or boudin width) is controlled by layer thickness. However, within individual boudin generations, influences such as structural inheritance, geometric complexity from fracture nucleation, and the effects of failure mode variation are dominant.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship statement\n\nBob Bamberg: Methodology, Investigation, Formal Analysis, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Visualisation; Christoph von Hagke: Conceptualisation, Methodology, Writing \u2013 Review & Editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition; Simon Virgo: Conceptualisation, Methodology, Investigation, Supervision, Funding Acquisition; Janos L.

This may reflect the fact that distinguishing bed-parallel sedimentary sills from depositional beds is challenging, with \u201csills likely to be mistaken for beds\u201d (Potter and Pettijohn, 1977, p.220), although their identification is critical to the understanding of the geology (e.g. Gao et al., 2020). The intrusion of sills into a sequence has a number of consequences for interpretations, including the raising or \u2018jacking up\u2019 of the overlying beds (e.g. Morley, 2003, p.391; Cobain et al., 2015, p.1818), interpretation of depositional facies (if intruded sands are not identified as such), connectivity of sands for migration of fluids and hydrocarbons (Jenkins, 1930; Dixon et al., 1995; Duranti and Hurst, 2004), and the effects of sills on mechanical stratigraphy during subsequent contractional (e.g. Palladino et al., 2016) or extensional deformation (e.g. Palladino et al., 2018).\nMany of the observations and criteria that have been established to recognise sills in sedimentary sequences are based on the intrusion of mudstone (e.g. Morley et al., 1998; Morley, 2003) and sandstone in marine and deep-water settings (see Hurst et al., 2011 for a review; Hurst et al., 2007; Cobain et al., 2015). Here we apply these criteria to shallow lacustrine settings, which are frequently used in palaeoseismic studies, as lakes are widespread and provide a refined stratigraphic template that readily records sediment movement associated with large earthquakes (e.g. Gao et al., 2020). In addition, some of the other potential triggers of soft-sediment deformation (SSD) associated with sedimentary dykes and sills, such as storm waves and tides, can be discounted in lacustrine settings due to the limited size of water bodies (e.g. Gao et al., 2020). Previous studies that have identified minor sedimentary sills associated with SSD in lacustrine settings include T\u00f6r\u0151 and Pratt (2015a, b, 2016) and Gao et al. (2020), although sills have in general not been widely-reported from such settings. An understanding of sedimentary sills that are injected into the lacustrine stratigraphy is, however, critical for the use of such sequences in palaeoseismic studies, as mobilised sediment and sills may easily be overlooked or confused with depositional units in the bedded sediments. It is crucial to distinguish sills from turbidites and debris flows, as these units are often used to constrain surficial SSD and hence earthquake timing in palaeoseismic studies (e.g. Lu et al., 2017, 2021a, b, c). Our aim is therefore to provide a first detailed account of criteria that may be used to distinguish sedimentary sills in lacustrine settings. This study addresses a number of research questions relating to sedimentary sills and their relationship with gravity-driven deformation including:\n\na)\nWhat controls the location of sills?\n\n\nb)\nIs deformation associated with intrusion of sills?\n\n\nc)\nHow are folded clasts created within sills?\n\n\nd)\nWhich criteria help identify bed-parallel sills?\n\n\ne)\nWhat is the timing and role of sills in gravity-driven deformation?\n\n\nf)\nWhat are the consequences of mis-identifying sills?\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nSediment mobilization and soft-sediment deformation\nIncreases in pore fluid pressure are an effective mechanism to reduce the shear strength of sediments and thereby expedite their failure (e.g. Maltman, 1994a, b and references therein). Although pore fluid pressures within sediments may be increased by a wide range of factors (see Obermeier, 1996, 2009 for reviews) one of the most widely-cited triggers are earthquake events. Seismicity may trigger the initial slope failure that creates a slump sheet or mass transport deposit (MTD) that then translates downslope under the influence of gravity. Thicker slumped units may locally increase the loading and pore fluid pressures on underlying sediments, potentially leading to the injection of sedimentary intrusions, thereby promoting continued downslope translation (e.g. Strachan, 2002).\nIn general, the mobilization of unlithified sediments is defined as \u201crendering the sediment capable of motion and the bulk movement that commonly results\u201d (Maltman and Bolton, 2003, p.9). The nature of the structures that form in unlithified sediment are determined by relationships between the ratio of the cohesive strength of the sediment (due to grain weight) and the pore fluid pressure (Knipe, 1986; Ortner, 2007). Fluid pressure lower than grain weight generates hydroplastic deformation that modifies bedding to create folds and shears. When fluid pressure is equal to grain weight, then sediment liquefies to form laminar flow and bedding is destroyed. Finally, when fluid pressure is greater than grain weight, sediment fluidization occurs and generates turbulent flow that carries grains and destroys bedding (Knipe, 1986). Liquidization (including liquefaction) is a form of independent particulate flow (Knipe, 1986) and results in grains temporarily losing contact with one another, thereby permitting relative rotation and translation between grains.\n\n\n1.2\nMethodology of AMS analysis in sedimentary sills\nDeformation within rocks and sediments is characterised by magnetic fabrics which are analysed via the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) (e.g. Par\u00e9s, 2015). The AMS analysis is commonly used for depicting petrofabrics in soft sediments, revealing the flow and MTDs transport directions (e.g. Weinberger et al., 2017 and references therein) and quantifying inelastic deformation (e.g. Schwehr and Tauxe, 2003; Borradaile and Jackson, 2004; Levi et al., 2018; Weinberger et al., 2017, 2022). In this study we apply AMS analysis in order to characterize the magnetic fabric of sedimentary sills and thereby potentially recognise the direction of sediment injection.\nAMS is a second-rank tensor which is described by its principal values and principal axes, which are commonly represented as an ellipsoid (Borradaile and Jackson, 2004). The k\n1, k\n2 and k\n3 eigenvalues of the AMS correlate with the maximum K\n1, intermediate K\n2 and minimum K\n3 magnetic susceptibility axes. The long and short axes of particle shapes are generally aligned parallel to the maximum (K\n1\n) and minimum (K\n3) axes of magnetic susceptibility. Elongate particles deposited in still-water tend to lie parallel to the horizontal bedding plane, thereby creating a \u2018deposition fabric\u2019. This is marked by vertical and well-clustered K\n3 axes, while K\n1 and K\n2 axes are somewhat distinguishable and lie within the bedding plane forming an oblate shape to the AMS ellipsoid (k\n3\u226ak\n1, k\n2) (see Levi et al., 2006b). The original deposition magnetic fabric might evolve into a \u2018deformation fabric\u2019 or \u2018injection fabric\u2019 during later soft-sediment deformation, in which the K\n1 and K\n2 axes are well-clustered and clearly distinguishable.\nThe AMS in the case study was measured using a KLY-4S Kappabridge (AGICO Inc.) at the Geological Survey of Israel rock-magnetic laboratory, where the principal susceptibility axes and their 95% confidence ellipses (Jelinek 1978) were analysed with Anisoft42. Mean susceptibility (k\n\nm\n\n=k\n\n1\n\n+k\n\n2\n\n+k\n\n3\n\n\/3), degree of anisotropy (\n\nP\n=\n\nk\n1\n\n\/\n\nk\n3\n\n\n) and shape of the AMS (\n\nT\n=\n\n(\n2\nl\nn\n\nk\n2\n\n\u2212\nl\nn\n\nk\n1\n\n\u2212\nl\nn\n\nk\n3\n\n)\n\n\/\n\n(\nl\nn\n\nk\n1\n\n\u2212\nl\nn\n\nk\n3\n\n)\n\n\n, were calculated according to Jel\u00ednek (1981) and Tarling and Hrouda (1993).\n\n\n1.3\nInjection of sedimentary sills\nIt has long been recognised that sandstone dykes and sills are \u201cthe result of the forcible intrusion of liquified sand into a cohesive host\u201d (Collinson, 1994, p.111). Sills are considered to fill and inject along natural hydraulic fractures that largely propagate along weaker bedding planes and open normal to the plane of least compression (see Cobain et al., 2015 for a recent summary) (Fig. 1\n). It is also considered that sills are intruded at shallow depths \u201cwhere the vertical pore-fluid pressure gradient is equal to, or exceeds the overburden pressure, resulting in the minimum principal stress (\u03c33) being vertical\u201d (Palladino et al., 2020, p.14 and references therein) (Fig. 1).\nWhen considering sedimentary sills, it should be appreciated that they differ from igneous sills in that they may be locally mobilised and entirely sourced from immediately adjacent sediment, whereas igneous intrusions generally emanate from greater depths. Intrastratal deformation horizons created by the lateral flow and injection of sediment may evolve laterally into sills, although it should be noted that the two features \u201cdo not present a clear or essential distinction\u201d (Kawakami and Kawamura (2002, p.178) (Fig. 1). This point was summarised by Ogawa (2019, p.12) who states that \u201ccoherent beds are transitionally liquefied and intruding along the same horizon as sills, or remain at the same horizon as in situ brecciated beds\u201d. Thus, some susceptible beds may laterally evolve into horizons of locally mobilised sediment and sills that broadly maintain the same stratigraphic level (Fig. 1). This is considered a consequence of the injected sill failing to achieve a great enough fluid pressure that would permit it to overcome the strength of the overlying strata (Ogawa, 2019, p.12).\nA number of key papers have attempted to define detailed outcrop-based criteria that may be used to identify sandstone sills in basinal marine settings, and include Hiscott (1979), Archer (1984), Kawakami and Kawamura (2002), Macdonald and Flecker (2007), Hurst et al. (2011) and Palladino et al. (2020). Using the Dead Sea Basin as our case study, we utilise this range of criteria established in marine environments and apply them to sedimentary sills formed in a lacustrine setting.\n\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Dead Sea Basin is a continental depression bound by the western border fault zone, which comprises a series of oblique-normal stepped faults, and the left-lateral eastern border fault (Fig. 2\na and b) (Marco et al., 1996, 2003; Ken-Tor et al., 2001; Migowski et al., 2004; Begin et al., 2005). These faults comprise the Dead Sea Fault (DSF) system that was active from the Early Miocene to Recent (Nuriel et al., 2017), and has generated numerous earthquakes leading to deformation of the basin-fill deposits. The present study focusses on the Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation that was deposited in Lake Lisan at 70\u201314 ka and forms a pre-cursor to the modern Dead Sea (e.g. Haase-Schramm et al., 2004). The Lisan Formation comprises mm-scale aragonite laminae that were precipitated from the hypersaline waters of Lake Lisan during the summer, while sporadic flood events washed detrital-rich layers into the lake during the winter (Begin et al., 1974; Ben-Dor et al., 2019). Thin detrital laminae display grain sizes of \u223c8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm (silt), while the thicker (>10\u00a0cm) detrital-rich beds deposited after major floods comprise very fine (60\u201370\u00a0\u03bcm) sands (Haliva-Cohen et al., 2012). The detrital units are composed of quartz and calcite grains with minor feldspar and clays (illite-smectite) (Haliva-Cohen et al., 2012). Counting of aragonite-detrital varves, bracketed by isotopic dating, indicates average depositional rates of \u223c1\u00a0mm per year for the Lisan Formation (Prasad et al., 2009).\n\n\n2.2\nPatterns of slope failure around the basin\nThe Lisan Formation preserves very low <1\u00b0 depositional dips that are directed towards the depocentre of the Dead Sea Basin. Seismically-induced slope failure leads to downslope movement of sediment resulting in MTDs that form at the surface (e.g. Alsop et al., 2020d), together with potentially deeper sub-surface fold and thrust systems (FATS) and bed-parallel slip (BPS) planes (e.g. Alsop et al., 2020a, 2021a, b). Major earthquakes may also result in overturn and mixing of the water column that leads to precipitation of relatively competent 1\u00a0m thick gypsum horizons within the Lisan Formation (Ichinose and Begin, 2004; Begin et al., 2005). At the time of seismically-triggered deformation, the Lisan Formation is considered to have been weak and fluid saturated, and still currently retains \u223c25% fluid content (Arkin and Michaeli, 1986; Frydman et al., 2008).\nThe gravity-driven structures combine to create a regional pattern of radial slumping linked to the transfer of sediment downslope towards the depocentre of the basin (Alsop et al., 2020d) (Fig. 2a and b). Thus, in the northern part of the basin, the Lisan Formation displays SE-directed slumping, the central portion shows E-directed MTDs, the southern basin at Peratzim is marked by NE-directed slumping, while westerly-directed movement has been recorded from the eastern shores of the Dead Sea in Jordan (El-Isa and Mustafa, 1986) (Fig. 2b). Magnetic fabrics confirm the directions of slumping (Weinberger et al., 2017), with the bulk movement of sediment from the basin margins towards the centre resulting in the Lisan Formation being three times thicker in the depocenter, where drill cores penetrate numerous MTDs (Lu et al., 2017, 2021a, b, c; Kagan et al., 2018).\n\n\n2.3\nRationale for study area\nThe varve-like laminae of the Lisan Formation preserve detailed structural and stratigraphic relationships, making the Dead Sea Basin an ideal place to study the intrusion of sedimentary sills. Regional slopes that are visible today provide a clear kinematic framework, while the finely laminated upper \u2018White Cliff\u2019 portion of the Lisan Formation (Bartov et al., 2002) that was deposited at 31\u201315 ka (Torfstein et al., 2013) provides the best sections for analysis of sills. The Lisan Formation contains a range of deformed horizons that formed at varying depths below the surface:\n\na)\nSurficial deformation created MTDs that are directly overlain by sedimentary caps deposited out of suspension immediately following the slope failure (Alsop et al., 2018; 2020d).\n\n\nb)\nShallowly buried (<1\u00a0m) deformation created FATS bound by upper and lower detachments that directly influence overlying sedimentation at the surface (Alsop et al., 2021a, 2022).\n\n\nc)\nBuried deformation at depths of up to 20\u00a0m below the surface (the thickness of the hosting White Cliff strata) that created intrastratal FATS and BPS detachments (Alsop et al., 2020a, 2022).\n\n\nd)\nBuried deformation at depths of up to 20\u00a0m below the surface that created horizontal BPS marked by 2\u201310\u00a0mm thick layers of gouge formed during co-seismic shaking (Weinberger et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThe Lisan Formation therefore presents an opportunity to study the interaction of sedimentary sills with a range of deformation styles and depths below the surface in a lacustrine setting. Sills were intruded at maximum depths below the sediment surface of 20\u00a0m (the thickness of the hosting strata) and more generally <10\u00a0m. The interaction of some sills with surficial MTDs suggests very shallow intrusion within a few metres of the depositional surface on the lake floor. We take our examples of sills from two sites within the Lisan Formation at Miflat [N31\u00b0:21.42\u2033 E35\u00b0:22.49\u2019\u2019] and Peratzim [N31\u00b0:04.56\u2033 E35\u00b0:21.02\u2019\u2019] (Fig. 2b). These sites are located \u223c1\u20132\u00a0km east of Cenomanian-Senonian carbonates that form the footwall of the Dead Sea western border fault zone and represent marginal areas to Lake Lisan (Fig. 2b). Estimated water depths in Lake Lisan at these sites are <100\u00a0m from 70 to 28 ka, and up to 200\u00a0m water depth between 26\u201324 ka (Bartov et al., 2002, 2003).\n\n\n2.4\nDeformation, sedimentary sills and post-slumping clastic dykes\nModern flash floods sporadically incise wadis through the Lisan Formation creating vertical sections parallel to the movement direction of earlier gravity-driven failures (Alsop et al., 2017; 2020d). Although some variability exists, slump fold hinges typically trend NW-SE and verge towards the depocentre of the basin further to the NE (Alsop et al., 2021a) (Fig. 2b). At Miflat, fold hinges are NNW-SSE trending with slump transport directed towards the ENE and the centre of the basin (Alsop et al., 2020a) (Fig. 2b). Previous analysis of slump folds using dip isogons (e.g. see Ramsay, 1967; Fossen, 2016, p.225 for details of the technique) shows folded aragonite layers to display Class 2 fold styles, whereas detrital-rich layers are marked by more parallel (Class 1) folds (Alsop et al., 2020c). This suggests that, at the time of folding, aragonite layers were weaker than the detrital beds, which were generally thicker and more competent (Alsop et al., 2017; 2020c).\nThe gravity-driven deformation noted above and in previous publications (e.g. Alsop et al., 2019) was seismically-triggered and is associated with previously undescribed sedimentary sills in the Lisan Formation. Sills are generally less than 0.5\u00a0m thick and comprise a mixture of disaggregated fine-grained sand and silt aragonite and detrital grains that are mixed together to form a brown or buff-coloured sediment. The colour variation of the matrix is interpreted to reflect varying components of aragonite and detrital grains and is similar to gouge created along thrusts and detachments (e.g. Weinberger et al., 2016; Alsop et al., 2018). Larger (up to 10\u00a0cm) aragonite and detrital fragments are preserved within the finer matrix of sills and show local fracturing and disaggregation. The lack of compaction-related fabrics reflects the absence of appreciable overburden (<10\u00a0m), suggesting only limited later compaction occurred (see Alsop et al., 2019).\nThe sedimentary sills, together with the various types of gravity-driven structures (MTDs, FATS, BPS), are subsequently cut across by clastic dykes which were triggered by seismicity and are a widespread feature in the Lisan Formation (e.g. Levi et al., 2006a, b). The late-stage clastic dykes locally feed minor sedimentary sills that formed up to 18\u00a0m below the depositional surface (Levi et al., 2006b), but these younger intrusions are unrelated and cut across the older MTDs and sedimentary sills that we describe here.\nOptically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates on sediment contained within the late-stage dykes gives ages of between 15 and 7 ka (Porat et al., 2007) and they therefore post-date deposition and associated gravity-driven deformation of the upper White Cliff Lisan Formation at 31\u201315 ka (Haase-Schramm et al., 2004; Torfstein et al., 2013). The clastic dykes may themselves be locally offset by subsequent co-seismic horizontal slip (Weinberger et al., 2016) but are otherwise undeformed and show no evidence of vertical shortening linked to compaction. We now provide examples of some of the key features that are used to identify sedimentary sills in bedded lacustrine sequences from the Lisan Formation. In all photographs, the eastern (downslope) side is on the right, while scale is provided by a 15\u00a0mm diameter coin, 10\u00a0cm chequered rule, and a 30\u00a0cm long hammer.\n\n\n\n3\nExternal geometry of sills\nThe overall geometry of sedimentary intrusions provides a range of basic features and relationships described below that may be used to help determine the nature and origin of sills.\n\n3.1\nChanges in thickness of sills\nThe geometry of sedimentary sills has been previously mapped in detail by Hiscott (1979) and described by Archer (1984) who note that sills may laterally terminate in a range of steep and \u2018blunt\u2019 margins, (e.g. Palladino et al., 2020, p.5) or may display more tapered shapes (Fig. 1). These more tapered terminations have been described as overall wedge-shaped geometries (Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002, p.172).\nIn new examples from the case study, we observe irregularities in the lower contact of sills that are associated with rapid and significant changes in thickness of the sill (Fig. 3\na\u2013c). The changes in thickness are locally pronounced with sills more than doubling in thickness over relatively short (25\u00a0cm) distances (Fig. 3a\u2013c).\n\n\n3.2\nBifurcation and bridging in sills\nThe lateral bifurcation of sedimentary sills has been previously shown and described by Truswell (1972), Hiscott (1979), Archer (1984)\nParize and Fries (2003), and Macdonald and Flecker (2007) (Fig. 1).\nIn new examples from the case study, bifurcation of sills results in two fingers of injected sediment intruding into weaker aragonite-rich beds (Fig. 3a\u2013c). A lozenge of host stratigraphy is preserved between the two intrusions (Fig. 3a\u2013c). In some cases, distinct beds of aragonite-rich stratigraphy dipping at 30\u00b0 separate two pointed terminations of sill segments that form \u2018bayonet\u2019 features (Figs. 1, 3d-f). The screen or \u2018bridge\u2019 of sediment between the two segments of the sill is beneath one segment and above the other and does not therefore correspond to a thrust configuration. The bridge may remain relatively intact and separate the two sill segments (Fig. 3d\u2013f) or be compromised such that the \u2018broken bridge\u2019 protrudes into the amalgamated sill (Figs. 1 and 3g, h). These features are similar to those observed previously in sedimentary sills (e.g. Archer, 1984, p.1201) and also more generally in igneous sills (e.g. Baer, 1993; Hutton, 2009; Magee et al., 2019) (Fig. 1).\n\n\n3.3\nScreens of host sediment\nThin (<5\u00a0cm) laterally continuous, laminated layers that have the same appearance as the adjacent host sediments are preserved within deformed and injected sedimentary horizons (Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002, p.175) (Fig. 1). Screens also separate the \u2018multi-layer\u2019 sills previously described by Hurst et al. (2011, p.222).\nWithin the case study, we observe comparable thin (<2\u00a0cm) laminated layers within sills, which are interpreted as \u2018screens\u2019 of host sediment parallel to the margins of the sill (Fig. 4\na\u2013k). These thin horizons display injection and wedging by the overlying intrusion (Fig. 4d, i, k), indicating that they are remnants of the host stratigraphy enclosed by adjacent sills.\n\n\n\n4\nInternal structure of sills\nA range of internal textures and fabrics are described below that provide criteria to help distinguish sedimentary sills from depositional beds.\n\n4.1\nInternal layering\nCollinson (1994, p.111) has previously noted that sandstone sills and dykes may show \u201ca marginal foliation parallel with the walls, reflecting shearing during intrusion\u201d (Fig. 1).\nIn the case study, the internal fabric is sub-parallel to the margins and bridges within the sill, although it locally appears to contain more folding towards the pointed \u2018bayonet\u2019 terminations (Fig. 3d\u2013h). In general, fragments up to 10\u00a0cm long may become aligned to create a fabric parallel to the margin of the sill (Fig. 4a\u2013e). In addition, faint laminae are occasionally observed within sills, although homogenous sill matrix with mm-scale aragonite and detrital fragments is more typical (Fig. 5\na\u2013f). It is notable that where sills bifurcate and intrude along detachments and faults, the fabric within the injection remains parallel to the margins of the cross-cutting intrusion (Fig. 5g\u2013k).\n\n\n4.2\nGrading and brecciation\nAngular clasts that form lenses of breccia within sills have been recorded by Archer (1984), while grading of the matrix in sills has been reported by Macdonald and Flecker (2007) (Fig. 1).\nIn the case study, no grading has been observed within sills, although it is preserved within sedimentary caps that overlie MTDs and were deposited out of suspension following slope failure (Fig. 5a) (e.g. Alsop et al., 2021a; b, 2022). Localized zones of brecciation are developed that comprise disorganised cm-scale angular fragments of laminated host sediment (Fig. 4e, g). Although brecciation is clearly not unique to sills and may form during downslope-directed MTD movement, its presence does not preclude the interpretation of a sill.\n\n\n\n5\nNature of sill contacts\nMost criteria used to recognise sedimentary sills in typically bedded sequences concentrate on the upper margin of the sill, as this is where the nature of intrusive contacts versus conformable depositional boundaries may most clearly be distinguished.\n\n5.1\nSharp upper contacts\nA number of authors have noted that the upper margins of sills form sharp intrusive contacts that, unlike adjacent depositional beds, lack a gradation into the overlying sediment (e.g. Truswell, 1972; Hiscott, 1979; Archer, 1984).\nWithin the case study, sills are marked by sharp upper contacts, although this may become more difficult to distinguish where sills are intruded into detrital-rich beds of similar composition to the sill itself (Fig. 4a\u2013d, 5a-d). In addition, the varved nature of lacustrine sediments typically results in widespread sharp contacts, making this criterion potentially less significant in these settings.\n\n\n5.2\nErosive upper contacts\nIrregular upper surfaces to sills that erode into the overlying sequence are a defining characteristic, which demonstrate an intrusive origin for sills that cannot be created during deposition of beds (e.g. Macdonald and Flecker, 2007; Hurst et al., 2011) (Fig. 1).\nWithin the case study, erosive upper contacts are exposed for up to 5\u00a0m along individual sills (Fig. 4a\u2013d, 5a-d). Erosion cuts through 10\u00a0cm of an established roof stratigraphy above the sill that itself can be correlated for several metres along the upper contact (Fig. 4a\u2013d).\n\n\n5.3\nCross-cutting of laminae in overburden\nThe erosion and truncation of laminae in host sediments above sills has been reported by a number of authors, including Archer (1984), Kawakami and Kawamura, (2002, p.172) and Palladino et al. (2020, p.5) (Fig. 1). Although such discordant relationships may be difficult to ascertain due to the bed-parallel nature of sills, they are critical pieces of evidence that indicate the overlying strata was already in place at the time of intrusion.\nWithin the case study, some cross-cutting of overlying stratigraphy is locally observed (e.g. Fig. 3d\u2013f, 4i, j). However, sills are generally bedding-parallel, possibly reflecting the easy planes of intrusion provided by the highly-laminated lacustrine sequence.\n\n\n5.4\nRoof pendants\nRoof pendants are created where portions of overlying stratigraphy are partially enclosed by the underlying sill, or become entirely detached (e.g. Archer, 1984).\nWithin the case study, detached parts of the roof sequence, containing a 2\u00a0cm thick pale grey-green detrital-rich bed that forms a recognisable stratigraphy, are observed in clasts (Fig. 4g). The correlation of stratigraphy from the detached pendant to the roof confirms the source of the clast to be erosion of the overburden. In most cases, however, the clasts are fragmented and disaggregated to such an extent that no stratigraphy is discernible.\n\n\n5.5\nApophyses emanating from sills\nThe presence of sills in an otherwise bedded sequence may be detected by small offshoots emanating from the sill (e.g. Truswell, 1972; Hiscott, 1979) (Fig. 1).\nWithin the case study, cm-scale apophyses of sills inject both upwards and downwards into the adjacent stratigraphy (Fig. 5a\u2013f). The margins of apophyses are sharp and associated with fractures that terminate in more competent detrital beds in the stratigraphy (Fig. 5e and f). Where apophyses inject above the sill, then they deflect the overlying stratigraphy upwards, whereas injection beneath the sill leads to downwards deflections (Fig. 5e and f). In each case, the stratigraphy on either side of the apophyses is not offset across fractures, but simply deflected by the intrusion.\n\n\n\n6\nClasts preserved within sills\nFragments of adjacent stratigraphy form intra-clasts (or more simply clasts) preserved within sills. Although clasts may be incorporated into a variety of sedimentary deposits across a broad range of environments, their distribution, geometry and detailed cross-cutting relationships aid in the identification of sills.\n\n6.1\nDistribution of large clasts\nA number of authors have noted that clasts may be concentrated towards both the upper and lower contacts of sedimentary sills (e.g. Truswell, 1972; Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002; Macdonald and Flecker, 2007; Hurst et al., 2011; Palladino et al., 2020).\nWithin the case study, larger clasts of laminated aragonite up to 20\u00a0cm in length are preserved towards both the upper and lower contacts of sills (e.g. Fig. 4a\u2013h). There is no discernible grading of these clasts next to the margins of the sill.\n\n\n6.2\nClasts cut by upper surface of sill\n\nKawakami and Kawamura (2002) observed \u2018flatly planed clasts\u2019 within a sill that were abruptly truncated by the upper intrusive contact.\nWithin the case study, truncation of clasts is best observed where the clasts are inclined and the horizontal contact of the sill cuts directly across the laminae in the clast (Fig. 4d, f). Laminae in the excised clasts display folding and deformation immediately adjacent to the sill contact. The laminae in the host sediment immediately above the truncated clast show no depositional variation in thickness or composition, indicating that clasts had not influenced sedimentation, thereby supporting the intrusive sub-surface origin of the sill (Fig. 4d, f).\n\n\n6.3\nAlignment of clasts\nPrevious authors have reported that clasts are frequently aligned parallel to the margins of sills (e.g. Archer, 1984; Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002; Hurst et al., 2011, p.221).\nWithin the case study, aragonite laminae form highly-elongated clasts up to 20\u00a0cm in length that are generally parallel to the margins of the sill, and to sediment screens within sills (e.g. Fig. 4d).\n\n\n6.4\nClasts contain overlying stratigraphy\nWithin the case study, some clasts contain portions of stratigraphy that can be correlated with that in the overlying sequence above the sill (Fig. 4g). In this situation, such clasts can only have been derived from the overlying stratigraphy, indicating that an intrusive sill contact cuts the finer-grained detrital layer in the overlying sequence.\n\n\n6.5\nFolded clasts\nPrevious authors have noted that clasts within sills may be tightly and recumbently folded, or even imbricated (e.g. Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002, p.175).\nWithin the case study, such folded clasts are frequently observed (e.g. Fig. 4f\u2013h) despite the underlying and overlying aragonite laminae adjacent to the sill showing no evidence of folding. No imbrication of clasts has been observed in the present study.\n\n\n\n7\nFolding and deformation on margins of sills\nIntrusion of sedimentary sills creates a variety of features associated with deformation and folding of the host sediment that may be used to distinguish sills from depositional units.\n\n7.1\nBed-parallel wedging\nSedimentary sills may locally intrude and create \u2018wedge-shaped\u2019 fissures parallel to the lamination in the host sediment (e.g. Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002).\nWithin the case study, m-scale wedges may form at the termination of sills to create \u2018pointed bayonet\u2019 geometries (e.g. Fig. 3d\u2013h), or at a cm-scale where wedges of injected sediment develop on the upper or lower contacts of the sill, highlighting its intrusive character (Figs. 4k and 5a, b). Wedging of intrusive sills is generally developed along particular beds and is parallel to laminae, thereby providing an insight into the strong control exerted by layering on the intrusive process (Figs. 4k and 5b).\n\n\n7.2\nFolding on margins of sills\nWithin the case study, host strata that elsewhere is undeformed may locally be intensely folded along the margins of sills. Such folds, which are generally recumbent and tight-isoclinal, are developed above wedges of intrusive sediment, indicating that the localized folding was created during injection of the sill rather than being related to MTDs (Fig. 6\na\u2013h, 7a-f).\nIn our first example, the upper margin of the sill cuts across laminae in the overlying sequence while the lower contact remains bed-parallel or forms wedges that intrude into the underlying beds (Fig. 6a\u2013c). A small vertical sediment intrusion injects upwards from the sill and cuts overlying beds that are locally deflected (Fig. 6a\u2013c). The deflected beds, together with the intrusion, are truncated by overlying stratigraphy, indicating a possible unconformity or detachment surface (Fig. 6a\u2013c, f). Along the lower margin of the sill, an isoclinal fold with an overturned upper limb is formed in host aragonite-detrital laminated sediments (Fig. 6a\u2013c). Dip isogon analysis (Ramsay, 1967) shows that the aragonite-rich units form a fold with slightly thinned limbs compared to the hinge (Class 1C), whereas the detrital-rich beds maintain thickness on the lower limb (Class 1B) and hinge and are only slightly thinned on the overturned limb (Class 1C) (Fig. 6b, d). Greater thinning of aragonite- and detrital-rich layers on the upper limb of the fold reflects overturning of these beds.\nThe upper limb terminates in a downward deflecting tip that creates a \u2018barb\u2019 in the overall \u2018fish hook\u2019 shaped fold (Fig. 6c, e). The sill occupies the fold core and also penetrates into the stratigraphy underlying the folded horizon (Fig. 6a, e). Within the sill, a fabric defined by elongate mm-scale aragonite and detrital fragments is generally parallel to the margins of the sill. Adjacent to the isoclinal fold closure, it is wrapped around the hinge suggesting it has also been folded (Fig. 6b). The outer arc of the fold hinge is defined by a detrital layer and is associated with extensional fracturing along which minor intrusions of sill are injected (Fig. 6b). The preserved length of the overturned fold limb (\u223c80\u00a0cm) is considerably longer than the thickness of the sill at this site (\u223c20\u00a0cm) (Fig. 6c). A smaller recumbent fold with sheared upper limb is preserved immediately to the E (Fig. 6c, f, g), suggesting that the folding process may have been repeated along the base of the sill.\nIn our second example, the upper and lower contacts of the sill are parallel to bedding, but locally create wedge-shaped terminations that intrude into the host stratigraphy (Fig. 7\na and b). Segments of the sill are intruded above and below marker stratigraphy, which creates bridges that separate the lateral terminations of each segment (Fig. 7a\u2013d). Stratigraphy is locally \u2018jacked-up\u2019 adjacent to the sill, with stratigraphic contacts being preserved at the upper tips of the injected sill segment (Fig. 7d and e). In some cases, the lateral terminations of segments form two fingers that inject parallel to bedding, or cross-cut more competent (detrital) beds where the tips of the intrusion are marked by minor shears (Fig. 7f). Intrusion of the sill creates isoclinal folds, with the upper limb of the fold being overturned and sheared out, while the fold core is occupied by the sill (Fig. 7a\u2013f). In both of our examples, the upper fold limbs are overturned towards the east, although we have also observed overturning towards the west. The propagation direction of sill intrusion may be perpendicular to the viewer and \u2018out of plane\u2019, if structures in igneous sills are used as an analogy (e.g. Baer, 1993).\n\n\n\n8\nSills associated with downslope-directed thrusting and folding\nIntrastratal detachments form within the sub-surface and result in overburden sliding downslope towards the east or northeast and the depocentre of the basin. Detachments are typically parallel to bedding, although may locally transect and offset earlier faults and thereby provide an estimate of displacement (Alsop et al., 2020a). Sediment injections are formed of remobilised sediment that comprises a fine-grained aragonite and detrital mixture containing larger cm-scale clasts of laminated sediment. Some of this injected sediment was previously described as gouge by Alsop et al. (2018), although it clearly may intrude upwards from detachments at the base of FATS and MTDs.\n\n8.1\nIntrusion of sills along basal detachments to folds\nSills in the case study form along basal detachments, which translate overlying strata downslope, resulting in recumbent or upright folds that are detached directly on the sill (Fig. 8\na\u2013f). The overturned limbs of downslope-verging recumbent folds are sharply truncated by sills (Fig. 8a\u2013f). More upright anticlines that also \u2018ride\u2019 on detachments marked by sills are associated with sedimentary dykes that intrude upwards, and potentially out of plane, from detrital-rich beds in the cores of anticlines, suggesting high fluid pressures (Fig. 8e and f). The \u2018pinched\u2019 shape of the folded detrital layer implies a \u2018hinge-collapse\u2019 scenario (e.g. Fossen, 2016, p.273), with the detrital-rich layer feeding the intrusions (Fig. 8e and f). Sediment injections extending above the deformed horizon indicates that intrusions either develop after the MTD had formed, or the folds were created in the shallow sub-surface during intrastratal deformation (Fig. 8a\u2013f, 9a-d). Folds detaching on underlying sills, together with the intense sheared fabric within the sills (Fig. 8c and d) suggests that intrusions are syn-deformational with high fluid pressures facilitating downslope movement of sediment.\n\n\n8.2\nIntrusion of sills along basal detachments and thrust ramps\nDownslope-verging FATS detach on underlying sills that are <10\u00a0cm thick and locally cut across fold hinges (Fig. 8g\u2013i). The underlying stratigraphy remains unfolded and parallel to the intrusions, which contain elongate aragonite fragments aligned parallel to the contacts (Fig. 8g\u2013i). The sediment injection with marked internal fabric forms a basal detachment or \u2018floor thrust\u2019 to the system. Sediment injections also form along thrust ramps, with localised \u2018fingers\u2019 intruding upwards and cross-cutting the folds overlying the ramp (Fig. 9\na\u2013d). Detrital layers form buckle folds suggesting that they were relatively competent at the time of deformation and were then cross-cut by intrusions. In. Fig. 9e\u2013k, the fingers of homogenous detrital-rich sill have intruded along particular horizons of aragonite-rich host sediment. Adjacent sills may locally join one another via linking dykes that cross-cut stratigraphy. In some cases, sills display \u2018frilled\u2019 margins where the intrusive contact is irregular on the scale of mm-cm (Fig. 9g). Injections may be cut by thrusts that also affect the overlying sequence, indicating that sills were intruded into the sub-surface prior to gravity-driven deformation.\n\n\n8.3\nIntrusions of sills along roof detachments to FATS\nWhere roof detachments are developed above FATS, deformation is considered to form beneath a sedimentary overburden in the sub-surface (Alsop et al., 2021a, b). Sills are intruded above FATS in positions where roof detachments generally form, thereby masking any such detachments (Fig. 10\na\u2013g). The lack of a sedimentary cap, coupled with the style of buckle folding of detrital units, indicates competent beds, and is consistent with sub-surface folding and thrusting (Fig. 10a\u2013g). The sill varies in thickness from 3\u00a0cm to 10\u00a0cm and contains aligned aragonite and detrital fragments that parallel the margins of the sill (Fig. 10c\u2013g). The upper surface of the sill is irregular and cuts across the overlying sequence, while the lower contact truncates underlying folds and thrusts that verge towards the E (Fig. 10a\u2013g). The truncation of underlying folds, coupled with the sill being deformed by underlying thrusts, is consistent with intrusion during downslope-directed sub-surface deformation.\n\n\n\n9\nSills associated with downslope-directed extension and normal faulting\n\n9.1\nSediment injection along normal faults\nSediment injections in the case study can intrude directly along normal faults that cut across stratigraphy (Fig. 5g\u2013k). In these examples, the normal faults are assumed to have rooted into underlying detachments that are now masked by the sill (Fig. 5g\u2013k). Small elongate \u2018flakes\u2019 of aragonite within the injections are parallel to the margins of the intrusion along detachments and normal faults, indicating that the intrusion was a single event rather than multiple episodes. Development of injected sediment along both detachments and normal faults suggests that they potentially operated at the same time.\n\n\n9.2\nSills along detachments\nSills up to 5\u00a0cm thick may form directly along bedding-parallel detachments (Fig. 11\na\u2013d). Overlying normal faults become listric and flatten into the injection marking the detachment, while the upper parts of the normal faults are also cut by a detachment. Truncation of marker beds (shown in purple) by the sill is consistent with extensional movement. In Fig. 11e\u2013h, the sill forms a wedge beneath a rotated package of overlying strata that resembles a listric fault. Fingers of the sill locally intrude above the rotated sediment, while the top of the sill gently transects across the overlying stratigraphy that forms a \u2018roll-over\u2019 anticline (Fig. 11 e-h). Injection of the sill both beneath the listric fault, and locally above rotated beds, suggests that it was intruded during the extensional movement. Downslope-dipping normal faults are marked by breccia zones up to 10\u00a0cm wide that are offset by later normal faults and underlying sediment sills along detachments (Fig. 11i\u2013k). Normal faults may either sole into the underlying detachment and sedimentary injection or cut across it. The steep breccia zones may be created by tension formed during downslope slip above the detachment and injections (Fig. 11 l, m). The injection of sills along detachments is consistent with intrusion during extension associated with downslope movement of sediments.\n\n\n9.3\nSills cut by normal faults\nSedimentary sills may display a range of timing relationships (from 1 being the oldest to 3 being the youngest) relative to adjacent normal faults created during downslope movement of sediments. In the simplest scenario, bedding-parallel sills are cut and offset by normal faults (Fig. 12\na\u2013c). The normal faults are later displaced by bed-parallel slip (BPS) formed along detachments to create sawtooth or staircase geometries (Fig. 12a\u2013c) (see Alsop et al., 2020a for terminology). These relationships suggest that the sills largely pre-date the later faulting and detachments. In another situation, sills are cut by normal faults (1), with these faults later offset by BPS detachments (2) (Fig. 12d\u2013g). Detachments are cut by subsequent normal faults (3), while sills are locally remobilised to cut the early normal faults (1) (Fig. 12d\u2013g). In a similar example, sediment injections form along an early BPS detachment (1), that is subsequently offset by normal faults (2), (Fig. 12h and i). The early detachments are later reactivated (3) resulting in remobilization of sediment and minor offset of normal faults (2) (Fig. 12h and i). Although sills and sediment injections are locally cut by normal faults, the subsequent offset of normal faults by BPS along detachments, that may also develop sills, collectively indicates that the timing of sills, BPS detachments and normal faults are intimately related and broadly contemporaneous with one another.\n\n\n\n10\nAMS analysis of injected sediment sills\nAlthough AMS has seldom been used in the analysis of sills within the Lisan Formation (but see Levi et al., 2006b, their Fig. 8 [B1]), it has been employed in the analysis of injection directions in clastic dykes (Levi et al., 2006a, b; Jacoby et al., 2015). In MTDs and slumps of lacustrine sediments, K\n1 axes become aligned with the orientation of fold hinges, and K\n3 axes parallel to the poles of associated axial planes, showing a trail of orientations directed towards the absolute transport direction at the depocentre of the basin (Weinberger et al., 2017, 2022; Alsop et al., 2020b) (see section 1.2). The aragonite and the detritus layers of the Lisan Formation are diamagnetic and paramagnetic, respectively, while the bulk magnetic susceptibility is typically positive. Titanomagnetite, magnetite, and greigite are the ferromagnetic carriers in the detrital laminae (e.g. Ron et al., 2006; Levi et al., 2006a, 2014).\nIn this case study we analysed the magnetic fabrics of 9 samples from a sill exposed at Peratzim (Fig. 13\na). The magnetic fabrics developed in this sill (Fig. 4a\u2013c, 13a) are strongly oblate with clustered K\n1 and K\n2 axes being clearly distinguishable, while K\n3 axes are off vertical (Fig. 13b and c). Based on the orientation trails of these K\n3 axes, the weak deformation magnetic fabric suggests horizontal flow within the sill that is directed towards the SE (see details of technique in Levi et al., 2006b; Weinberger et al., 2017). Intrusion and flow in the sill towards the SE are parallel to the strike of the overlying fold and thrust structures within the MTDs.\n\n\n11\nDiscussion\n\n11.1\nWhat controls the location of sills?\nThe intrusion of sills is created by high fluid pressures that fluidize sediment leading to its injection within bedded sequences. Increases in fluid pressure may be generated by a variety of factors including glacial loading (e.g. Phillips et al., 2013), sediment overloading and storm waves, although earthquakes are also frequently cited and are considered the likely source in the Lisan Formation (Levi et al., 2006b, 2008, 2011) and this study. Indeed, Hiscott (1979, p.6) notes that \u201cearthquakes may have been responsible for both slumping and liquefaction\u201d. Increases in fluid pressure are locally controlled by baffles or barriers to fluid flow that, in the present study, include thick detrital beds, deformed FATS and MTD horizons, or gypsum units (Fig. 11e). The importance of overlying seals that allow fluid pressure to build up within a sequence prior to the intrusion of sedimentary sills has been recognised by Hiscott (1979) (see also Ogata et al., 2014a).\nWe have presented a number of examples in this case study of sills being bound above and below by thicker detrital-rich horizons that presumably trapped fluids and encouraged mobilization and injection of sediment during seismic events (Fig. 4a\u2013d, 5a-f). The recognition of bed-parallel sills adjacent to such detrital horizons may, however, be problematic, as sills are composed of mixed aragonite and detrital sediment that superficially resembles the detrital beds (Fig. 5a\u2013f).\nFATS may detach on sills suggesting that intrusion of the sediment occurred during downslope shearing (Figs. 8, 9a-d). The development of sills above FATS in a position occupied by a roof detachment (Fig. 10) indicates that deformation occurred in the sub-surface (Alsop et al., 2022). In such situations, extreme care needs to be taken that sills are not confused with the mixed aragonite-detrital capping layers that are deposited out of suspension following surficial failure of MTDs (e.g. Alsop et al., 2021a, b). The inability to distinguish injected sills from sedimentary caps in buried sequences may lead to the misidentification of sub-surface FATS and surficial MTDs.\nSills can form parallel to the basal shear zone of MTDs, which may be more competent than the host stratigraphy due to de-watering and seismic strengthening (Fig. 4a\u2013d, 5a-f). Sills also intrude above slumps (e.g. Hiscott, 1979, p.6), although they generally form beneath MTDs that were created at the sediment surface and subsequently acted as local baffles to fluid migration. In some cases, sills with erosive upper contacts lie just 10\u00a0cm below the base of the overlying MTD (Fig. 4a\u2013d). Hiscott (1979, p.6) notes that \u201csubsequent slumps, however, may have loaded pre-existing deposits, causing liquefaction and mobilization of sands\u201d. The suggestion is that mobilization and intrusion of the sill may have taken place during this subsequent slump event. It is possible that fluid pressures are increased by thickening associated with thrusting and folding within the overlying slump, which ultimately leads to injection of the sill. Similar intrastratal deformation triggered by emplacement of overlying MTDs has been previously suggested (e.g. Auchter et al., 2016).\nHowever, slumps and MTDs within the Lisan Formation are generally relatively thin (frequently <1\u00a0m) and would therefore result in only a limited increase in fluid pressure associated with loading. For example, we calculate that if the sediment was under a 50\u00a0m water column and below 2\u00a0m of sediment overburden, the estimated pressure was around 0.66\u00a0MPa. An extra 1\u00a0m of sediment emplaced during MTD movement is about 0.02\u00a0MPa (i.e. at least an order of magnitude less than the vertical pressure). Such a small addition of pressure may not be significant enough to cause fluidization, and it is therefore possible that other potential mechanisms, including pressure build-up during the passage of seismic P waves, may lead to fluidization and injection of sills. It is generally considered that earthquakes with M\u00a0>\u00a05 represents the minimum magnitude capable of temporarily transforming sediments from grain-supported to fluid-supported, leading to deformation and injection of sills and dykes (e.g. Leeder, 1987; Ambraseys, 1988; Leila et al., 2022).\n\n\n11.2\nIs deformation associated with intrusion of sills?\nIntrusion of igneous sills into shallow unconsolidated sequences can lead to soft-sediment folding and thrusting in the adjacent host sediments (e.g. Duffield et al., 1986). Thrusting and folding of sediments may form at the tips of propagating igneous sills and magma fingers (e.g. Schofield et al., 2012; Spacapan et al., 2017) and is considered part of the intrusive process. Although Duranti and Hurst (2004, p.18) have noted from studies of drill cores that deformation frequently develops in beds adjacent to sedimentary sills, there is a general lack of detailed reports of such deformation. We now discuss the folding mechanisms developed along the margins of sills in the case study.\n\n11.2.1\nHow are peel-back folds created along the margins of sills?\nAn intriguing question arises from this case study as to how recumbent isoclinal folds with overturned limbs longer than the thickness of the intruded sill are created (e.g. Fig. 6). Clearly, the entire overturned limb cannot have rotated as a single entity through the vertical in a \u2018fixed hinge\u2019 fold model as the thickness of the sill is too thin to allow this.\nFlume experiments have previously been used to examine shear-derived folding and mixing between granular flows and underlying loose substrates (Rowley et al., 2011). Given that mobilization of sediment to create sills involves liquidization, we suggest that the experiments of Rowley et al. (2011) on granular flows are also applicable to sedimentary sills. Rowley et al. (2011, their Fig. 5) created recumbent tight-isoclinal folds within the substrate that locally refold and wrap-around the granular flow material. Rowley et al. (2011, p.876) note a number of key points that are consistent with the peel-back folds of the present study: 1) continuous stratigraphy is preserved around the recumbent fold; 2) wrapping of flow material within the core of the fold demonstrates that the folding was created at the base of the flow rather than at the tip of the flow; 3) the distal (down-shear) termination of the fold is \u201cdeflected or smeared out\u201d; 4) inverted stratigraphy is created around the fold, \u201cas shear results in rotation during its development\u201d; and 5) more than one recumbent fold may develop beneath flows with a potential for periodicity in structures. We suggest that the granular flow structures described by Rowley et al. (2011) are similar to features produced during rapid injection of liquidized sedimentary sills into water-rich shallow sediments.\nIn this case study, we interpret folds created along the margins of sills to be formed by a peel-back mechanism whereby shear exerted by the injection of the sill locally rips up and peels back beds of the host sediment (Fig. 6h). The rolling hinge migrates in the direction of shear with \u2018markers\u2019 on the lower limb still attached to the substrate passing around the hinge onto the overturned upper limb (Fig. 6h). This peel-back fold mechanism directly accounts for the following observations:\n\ni)\n\nLength of fold limbs \u2013 The migrating hinge, where any point on the bed passes from the lower limb, around the hinge and onto the upper limb, does not require a thick sill because the length of the entire upper limb (80\u00a0cm) did not pass through the vertical at any single point (Fig. 6h). The limb simply rolled around the hinge as it peeled back in the direction of intrusion. This mechanism, akin to rolling-back the lid of a sardine tin, is therefore capable of creating isoclinal folds with long overturned limbs in relatively thin sills (Fig. 6h).\n\n\nii)\n\nThickness of fold limbs \u2013 The overturned limb of the peel-back fold is slightly thinned compared to the lower limb to create Class 1B and 1C folds (Fig. 6b, d). However, despite the recumbent and isoclinal nature of this fold, it does not attain a Class 2 geometry as observed in recumbent isoclinal folds developed within MTDs (see Alsop et al., 2020c, their Fig. 6). While it could be argued that differing fold geometries next to sills simply reflect non-profile views of folds, it should be noted that vertical cliff sections oblique to the exact profile plane of the horizontal fold hinge will only exaggerate the thickening and thinning of hinge and limbs, leading to apparent Class 2 folds. It could also be suggested that, as sills were injected in the sub-surface, beds were already slightly more compacted and competent, thereby resulting in the differing fold shapes compared to surficial MTDs.\n\n\n\nWe suggest that the differing fold geometries adjacent to sills and within MTDs reflect different fold mechanisms (see also Ogata et al., 2014b). Within MTDs, folds initiate by layer-parallel shortening that results in upright buckle folds that are modified by downslope shearing into recumbent tight-isoclinal folds associated with progressive simple shear deformation (Alsop et al., 2020c, their Fig. 6). In peel-back folds, the lower and overturned upper fold limbs are sub-horizontal and parallel to the plane of simple shear. They do not therefore undergo significant deformation and associated reduction in limb thickness. As the bed passes around the hinge it locally becomes vertical and will experience bending due to the horizontal simple shear exerted by the injecting sill. Bending results in local outer arc extension of the bed that creates open fractures injected by the sill (Fig. 6b). Opening of fractures may also be enhanced by later \u2018flattening\u2019 linked to overburden, although this is considered minor. The barb preserved on the tip of the overturned limb is formed during the initial \u2018rip-up\u2019 of the folded horizon and also supports the peel-back fold mechanism.\n\n\n11.2.2\nWhy are peel-back folds typically not observed along the upper contacts of sills?\nIt is notable that our examples of peel-back folds are only observed along the lower contacts of sedimentary sills (Figs. 6, 7). We also note that sills normally step upwards in the direction of propagation to create \u2018saucer\u2019 shaped intrusions (e.g. Hurst et al., 2011). Stepping in the direction of injection means that flow impacts on the front face of steps along the lower contact, resulting in peel-back folds. Conversely, intrusion along the upper contact of the sill (underside of steps) does not impede flow. Regular upward stepping in the direction of injection is therefore more likely to create peel-back folds along the lower sill contact.\n\n\n\n11.3\nHow are folded clasts created within sills?\nSills frequently inject along beds that are planar and unfolded as this represents an easier path of intrusion compared to cutting across disrupted stratigraphy in folded MTDs. Where sills containing isoclinally folded clasts pass through unfolded and undeformed horizontal beds, the question arises as to where such folded clasts are derived from.\nFolded clasts have been described from glacial outwash deposits where soft-sediment clasts were detached from underlying beds and repeatedly folded (Knight, 1999). It is suggested that folding initiated \u201cwhile part of the underside of the clast \u2026 was still attached to the bed.\u201d (Knight, 1999, p.301). Clasts are considered to become detached and \u2018ripped-up\u2019 from the bed immediately after folding during turbulent flow. Folding is therefore part of the detachment process of the clast, rather than erosion of a pre-existing folded layer. Folded clasts may thus be considered as portions of peel-back folds that have become detached from the host sediment. Imbrication and folding of mud clasts were also considered by Kawakami and Kawamura (2002, p.180) to form during dragging and displacement by intrastratal flow of sediment. The tight-isoclinal recumbent folds are detached from the host strata and display broadly Class 1B or 1C geometries (Figs. 3a and 6a of Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002). Within the case study we specifically note the following clast attributes.\n\nFold styles in clasts \u2013 Although folding within MTDs may create more open and upright buckle folds, there is a general lack of clasts with such open folds in sills. This conundrum is all the greater because numerous clasts within sills define isoclinal folds, the supposed \u2018end-member\u2019 product of progressive deformation. However, the peel-back fold mechanism next to sills will only produce recumbent, isoclinal folds due to the imposed sub-horizontal shear created by sill emplacement and general lack of bed shortening. Such peel-back folds may be detached and incorporated as clasts into the sill. As such, more open or upright folds would not be anticipated to form with this mechanism, although they may be expected where MTDs rework folded sequences.\n\nFolding of sill fabrics around clasts \u2013 Clasts with isoclinal folds may be detached and are found towards the upper margin of sills (Figs. 4h and 9k) or in beds still attached to host stratigraphy along the lower contact of the sill (Figs. 6, 7). We notice in some cases that aligned aragonite flakes and detrital fragments define a fabric in the sill that is also folded around the tight-isoclinal detached folds (Fig. 4h) and also fold hinges attached to the lower contact (Fig. 6b, e). While fabrics in sills that are folded around attached fold hinges demonstrate that peel-back folding is an integral part of the intrusive process, the preservation of folded fabrics around detached folded clasts indicates a more prolonged phase of deformation and tightening of folds after they became detached.\n\n11.3.1\nDistinguishing folded clasts in MTDs and sills\nLarge, folded clasts and blocks within MTDs may create topography (e.g. Ogata et al., 2014a), which is infilled and draped by overlying sedimentary caps and stratigraphy that is deposited on top of the MTD surface (e.g. Alsop et al., 2020d). Conversely, clasts within sills do not affect the upper intrusive margin of the sill and have no influence on the overlying bedded sequence. In fact, clasts may be truncated and planed flat along the contacts of sills (Fig. 4f).\nWithin MTDs, angular fragments may contain pre-existing folds that were re-worked from the MTD itself or plucked from the substrate of the MTD. In this case, the clast contains folds of varying geometries, with the clast margins cutting across the folds. Conversely, the margins of peel-back fold clasts tend to follow the form of the actual folded surface. This is considered unlikely if clasts are eroded from a folded substrate as the surfaces are too irregular. In summary, clasts within MTDs contain pre-existing folds that are cut across by the clast, whereas folded clasts in sills follow the form of the isoclinal peel-back folds derived from the intrusive margins.\n\n\n\n11.4\nWhich criteria help identify bed-parallel sills?\nThere have been numerous studies on sandstone injections within deep water marine sequences with Duranti and Hurst (2004, p.18) suggesting a list of criteria for the recognition of sedimentary sills from drill cores, while Hurst et al. (2011) provide a more general overview and catalogue of diagnostic features. Morley et al. (1998) and Morley (2003) provide analyses of mudstone and shale intrusions including sills across a range of scales from both outcrop and seismic data. We summarise the different criteria used to identify sills in Figs. 14 and 15\n\n and now discuss them with respect to the shallow lacustrine sequence of the Dead Sea Basin.\n\n11.4.1\nExternal geometry of sills\nThe ability of sills to rapidly change thickness when traced laterally along strike has been noted by Hiscott (1979), Kumar and Singh (1982) and Hurst et al. (2011, p.221), amongst others (Figs. 14a and 15a, b). This may lead to blunt or wedge-shaped terminations to sills (e.g. Macdonald and Flecker, 2007) (Fig. 14a). Abrupt changes in sill thickness often develop where irregularities in the upper contact are formed (e.g. Palladino et al., 2020), with Archer (1984) noting localised fracturing over rises in the upper contact. Examples from this study support the marked thickness changes described in sills from other settings and are associated with irregular roof geometries (Fig. 4i and j).\nBased on outcrop studies Truswell (1972), Hiscott (1979), Parize and Fries (2003) and Cobain et al. (2015) note that sandstone sills may display changes in stratigraphic position at the scale of the exposure (Fig. 15a and b). The ability to bifurcate and form several segments at different stratigraphic levels is a key characteristic of intrusions that is not shown by depositional units (e.g. Neuwerth et al., 2006; Diggs, 2007; Macdonald and Flecker, 2007; Gao et al., 2020, p.9) (Figs. 3, 14a and 15a, b). Additional geometries that help distinguish sills include bridges and screens of sediment that separate lateral terminations or \u2018pointed bayonets\u2019 of adjacent sills (Figs. 3, 4d and 14a, 15a, b). Bridges, together with bifurcation of sills at different stratigraphic levels, are key geometries that help distinguish sills from depositional units across a range of settings, including bedded lacustrine sequences.\n\n\n11.4.2\nInternal structure of sills\nFaint internal banding or layering is a general feature observed within sills (e.g. Figs. 14b and 15a, b) and has been reported by Kawakami and Kawamura (2002), who found it to be better developed if the poorly-sorted sandy matrix contains thin traces or films of mud. Sills up to 20\u00a0m thick were studied by Palladino et al. (2020) who note that mm-to dm-thick banding formed parallel to the margins of the sill and possibly represent repeated pulses of injection (e.g. Hurst et al., 2011, p.238). The thickest sills reported by Palladino et al. (2020) also contain convolute laminations and fluid escape structures, suggesting a later phase of fluid expulsion may develop. Similar fluid escape structures are also noted in this study (Fig. 6a, c, f). The development of lamination parallel to contacts is clearly not unique to sills and cannot be used as a diagnostic criterion.\nAngular clasts that form breccia within sills have been reported by Archer (1984) (Figs. 14b and 15a, b). Such breccia zones are discontinuous, form lenticular pods, and may also display a jigsaw configuration where adjacent clasts can be fitted back together (e.g. Palladino et al., 2020). The matrix of sills can contain normally graded intervals with coarser grains at the base, or display inverse grading with coarser material towards the top (e.g. Macdonald and Flecker, 2007; Hurst et al., 2011, p.238). Although breccias are observed within sills in the present study (Fig. 4e\u2013g, 14b), no grading is present, suggesting that the clasts and matrix may not have large density or viscosity contrasts, while potentially rapid intrusion leaves little time for organized grain settling. Brecciation and grading form within depositional beds across a range of sedimentary environments and are not unique features that can be used to identify sills. However, if brecciated clasts are unequivocally derived from the overlying sequence, then this strengthens the sill interpretation.\n\n\n11.4.3\nNature of sill contacts\nSharp upper contacts are a common feature of sills (e.g. Figs. 14c and 15c) that may also be associated with tool marks (e.g. Macdonald and Flecker, 2007) more typically found along the base of turbidites (e.g. Tucker, 2003, p.86). The development of tool marks on upper surfaces is created by the injection of the underlying sill, implying that intrusion was rapid. Rapid intrusion is also indicated by erosion of the overlying sequence, which serves as conclusive evidence that the sill does not form part of a conformable sedimentary sequence (e.g. Diggs, 2007; Palladino et al., 2016) (Figs. 14c and 15c). Both the lower and upper contacts of sills may be erosive and define irregular shapes with respect to the host sediment (e.g. Macdonald and Flecker, 2007; Hurst et al., 2011). Erosion along the upper surface of the sill may cross-cut laminae in overburden above the sill and create convex-up features termed \u2018scallops\u2019 by Hurst et al. (2011, p.221), which can be up to 10's of metres in width (Palladino et al., 2020) (Figs. 1, 14c and 15c). Although scallops in the case study are smaller (<1\u00a0m) (Fig. 4a\u2013d), the erosion and cross-cutting of overlying laminae demonstrates the intrusive origin of the sill. The \u2018frilled\u2019 nature of the upper sill contact (Fig. 9e\u2013h) shows that truncations were created by erosion rather than BPS detachments that generate planar surfaces (Alsop et al., 2020a).\nHighly irregular erosion may result in isolated roof pendants being locally preserved along the upper surface of sills (e.g. Archer, 1984, p.1203) (Figs. 14c and 15c). In some cases, the \u2018pendant\u2019 may become entirely detached from the roof to create clasts of recognisable overburden stratigraphy within the sill (e.g. Archer, 1984) (Fig. 4g). Such detached roof pendants in sills should not be confused with ball and pillow structures formed in unstably stratified depositional sequences. Other irregularities along sill contacts may be caused by minor apophyses injecting both upwards and downwards from sills resulting in local deflections of laminae, and once again demonstrating the intrusive origin of the sill (Figs. 14c and 15c). The nature of sill contacts, and in particular the presence of erosive upper contacts, are a key diagnostic feature of sills (Figs. 14c and 15c).\n\n\n11.4.4\nClasts contained within sills\nClasts have long been recognised to form a significant and identifiable component of sedimentary sills (e.g. Truswell, 1972; Hiscott, 1979; Surlyk et al., 2007; Cobain et al., 2015; Palladino et al., 2016) (Figs. 14d and 15d). In some cases, clasts have been only partially detached from the host sediment (e.g. Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002) thereby suggesting that large clasts are sourced and eroded from the adjacent beds (e.g. Chough and Chun, 1988; Hurst et al., 2011). An alternative interpretation summarised by Cobain et al. (2015) is that clasts are created by sills intruding along anastomosing fractures that preserve unmoved fragments of host rock (or clasts) within them. In the present case study, the lack of fracturing adjacent to sills, coupled with the variably orientated and folded nature of clasts, supports an erosive origin (Fig. 4e\u2013h).\nKawakami and Kawamura (2002, p.175) note that fragmented clasts dominate in the upper part of the sill, while Macdonald and Flecker (2007), Hurst et al. (2011) and Cobain et al. (2015) observe ripped up angular clasts towards both the upper and lower contacts (Figs. 14d and 15d). In the case study, clasts are concentrated towards either the upper (Fig. 9k-m) or lower margins (Fig. 11e\u2013h) of sills. A concentration of clasts towards the upper sill margin suggests that there may have been erosion along this upper contact resulting in the \u2018rip-down\u2019 clasts of Chough and Chun (1988) (Fig. 4d\u2013h). This is opposite to that generally observed in depositional systems where clasts are typically focussed towards the base of the unit, although reverse grading is possible.\nClasts may become aligned due to flow within a sill and this is pronounced where laminated sediment forms elongate clasts that create aligned trains (e.g. Archer, 1984), while mud-clasts form aligned ellipsoidal shapes within sills (Kawakami and Kawamura, 2002) (Figs. 14d and 15d). In the case study, clasts are parallel not only to the margins of sills, but also to the obliquely cross-cutting sheets formed along faults (Fig. 5i). This suggests that sediment injection, rather than settling or later compaction, leads to such fabrics. In summary, clasts originate from a variety of potential processes in sedimentary systems and are not unique to sills. However, where clasts are distributed towards the top of units, or truncated by upper contacts, or contain recognisable stratigraphic units sourced from overburden above the unit, then this significantly strengthens the sill interpretation (Figs. 14d and 15d).\n\n\n11.4.5\nFolding and deformation on margins of sills\nRecumbent isoclinal folds formed in basal shear zones directly beneath the downslope toe of MTDs have been reported by a number of authors, including Jablonska et al. (2018, their Fig. 12), Sobiesiak et al. (2018, their Fig. 9) and Cardona et al. (2020, their Fig. 13i and j). As recumbent folds are created by substrate shearing induced by both overlying MTDs and sills, resulting folds are superficially similar. However, there are a number of important differences when distinguishing folds developed beneath MTDs from those described from below sills (Figs. 14e and 15e).\nFirstly, in the examples noted from beneath MTDs, there is no evidence of sediment injection and \u2018wedging\u2019 beneath the fold, which is observed in sills (Figs. 6, 7). This is the most distinguishing factor between peel-back folds created below MTDs or in substrate beneath sills. Secondly, the characteristic \u2018fish-hook barb\u2019 that forms where the beds are initially ripped up during injection of sills also appears to be missing from the MTD examples, although this could simply reflect different competencies and rates of deformation in the two settings. Thirdly, the vergence of peel-back folds in MTDs is directed downslope parallel to movement, whereas the vergence of peel-back folds beneath sills is in the direction of intrusion, which may be downslope but can also be parallel to the strike of the slope and even upslope in some cases. Thus, peel-back folds are expected to verge towards the termination of the sill rather than necessarily in the downslope direction.\n\n\n11.4.6\nMagnetic fabrics within sedimentary sills\nAMS may be considered another useful criterion in the identification of sedimentary sills as the deformation fabric of sills is different from the deposition fabric of undisturbed beds. In the case of horizontal injection and formation of sills that enhances weak particle alignment, a \u2018quasi deformation fabric evolves, in which the oblateness of the AMS ellipsoid is quite strong but K\n1 and K\n2 axes are somewhat-clustered and distinguishable (Rees and Woodall, 1975; Levi et al., 2006a). Interpretation of the flow direction is based on K\n3 inclinations (e.g. Liu et al., 2001) and is in the opposite direction to the inclination of K\n1 or K\n2 axes (Levi et al., 2006a). In the case of high flow rates, all three AMS axes are distinguishable and the shape of the AMS ellipsoid changes gradually from oblate (k\n3\u226ak\n1,k\n2) to prolate (k3\n,k2\n\u226ak1\n). The principal axes are either grouped or streaked-out due to the rotation of particles during fast flow.\nIn the case study, the direction of injection within the sill is interpreted to be towards the SE (Fig. 13a\u2013c, 14f). The direction of slumping based on structural analysis in the overlying MTD is downslope towards the NE, and the flow within the sill is therefore normal to this and parallel to the inferred strike of the slope. It is also parallel to the strike of overlying thrusts within the MTD (Alsop et al., 2017). Flow and injection of sediment parallel to the strike of overlying thrusts has previously been reported from magnetic fabrics elsewhere in the Lisan Formation (Alsop et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n11.5\nWhat is the timing and role of sills in gravity-driven deformation?\nThe relationship between intrusion of sills and gravity-driven deformation has long been recognised with Hiscott (1979, p.2) stating that \u201cslumping may have been instrumental in the initiation of liquefaction and clastic injection\u201d, while Macdonald and Flecker (2007, p.260) note that \u201cZones of abundant intrusive sands are coincident with the high-strain zones\u201d. The role of fluids in generating relatively weak layers that encourage downslope movement to create large-scale MTDs has been examined by a number of authors, including Wu et al. (2021) and Gatter et al. (2021).\nTheoretically, sills may have a pre-, syn-, or post-kinematic relationships with respect to gravity-driven downslope movement of sediments. In the case study, it is not always possible to accurately determine the timing relationships as sills are intruded into beds that are unaffected by deformation, although regional clastic dykes consistently cross-cut sills, indicating that sills are not a late-stage feature (Fig. 3a\u2013c, 4a-e). In other cases, sills may develop directly along basal detachments along which overlying FATS propagate (Fig. 8a\u2013i, 9a-d, 15f). Sills and associated apophyses inject into the overlying beds indicating that the intrusions were syn-kinematic and that deformation developed below the sediment surface.\nSills may also intrude during extensional deformation where sheets inject along normal faults (Fig. 5g\u2013k, 11i-k), and also along associated bed-parallel detachments (Figs. 11, 14f and 15g). Cross-cutting relationships suggest that in some cases sills develop along bed-parallel detachments that are cut by later normal faults (Fig. 12). Terminations of sills marked by either contractional thrust faults (Fig. 9e\u2013h) or extensional listric fault geometries (Fig. 11e\u2013h) indicates that sediment mobilization and injection of sills occurred during gravity-driven deformation.\nIn general, the timing of sills with contractional and extensional deformation is broadly contemporaneous. As sills are considered to be geologically instantaneous, due to fluidization or liquefaction being temporary and not maintained over longer periods of time (e.g. Shanmugam, 2020), then associated deformation must also be rapid rather than related to creep processes. These observations support sub-surface sediment mobilization and injection of sills during slumping, with the trigger for fluidization and liquefaction potentially relating to the earthquake that also created the slope failure and deformation of sediment. In summary, sills may either pre-date or be synchronous with gravity-driven downslope deformation (Figs. 14g and 15f). No examples of sills clearly cross-cutting and therefore post-dating deformation have been observed in this study. These observations of mobilised sediments adjacent to downslope verging folds and thrusts suggest that fluid pressures within detrital-rich units were significantly increased during earthquakes and downslope movement of MTDs and slumps, as suggested by Ogata et al. (2014a) and Alsop et al. (2021a).\n\n\n11.6\nWhat are the consequences of misidentifying sills?\nThe failure to identify sedimentary sills within lacustrine sequences has a number of implications, not only for the interpretation of the general stratigraphy and depositional facies of a sequence, but also on the effects such sills may have on mechanical stratigraphy during any subsequent deformation of the laminated lake sediments. Remobilization of MTDs leading to sediment injection \u2018lenses\u2019 and volcanoes has previously been recognised using high resolution seismic data in Chilean lakes by Moernaut et al. (2009). These authors further suggest that intrusions may be multi-phase, reflecting repeated earthquake cycles as sediment injections reach higher stratigraphic levels.\n\n11.6.1\nRates of deformation\nAs sedimentary intrusions are considered to inject at geologically instantaneous rates, any deformation associated with sills must also be rapid. This supports rapid movement of surficial MTDs and sub-surface FATS rather than downslope creep of the sedimentary pile. However, deformation may continue after the initial intrusion, in which case the sill itself may become deformed, making identification more problematic.\n\n\n11.6.2\nStyles of deformation\nIt is critical to distinguish sedimentary sills, intruded in the shallow sub-surface, from turbidites and debris flows, deposited at the surface (Fig. 15f and g). If sills containing fragments and clasts are misidentified as debris flows and MTDs, this may lead to incorrect estimates of styles of deformation and slope failure (see Hurst et al., 2011; Alsop et al., 2022). Kawakami and Kawamura (2002, p.177) provide a list of criteria to distinguish sediment injection and deformation within sills from debris flow deposits. Although sills may display erosive upper contacts with the overlying host sediments, this will not be observed in depositional debris flows (Fig. 15f and g). In addition, while the upper contact of a sill may create an irregular surface that cuts across laminae in the host sediment, depositional beds may drape over and infill underlying irregularities (Fig. 15f and g). Although stratigraphy within overlying host sediments may project downwards into sills to create \u2018roof pendants\u2019, these are not observed in debris flows. Cohesive mud clasts may form protrusions at the surface of debris flows (e.g. Ogata et al., 2020, their Fig. 6), whereas elongate mud clasts within sills are truncated along the upper contact. This stratigraphic signature and relationship with the overlying sequence is key to distinguishing sills containing clasts from debris flows (Fig. 15f and g).\n\n\n11.6.3\nDepths of deformation\nMTDs and FATS generally compact and de-water sediment during movement and therefore form significant heterogeneities in buried sequences that may later focus sedimentary sills. However, where outcrops or observations are limited, as in narrow drill cores, then injection of sills along roof detachments above sub-surface FATS may be confused with sedimentary caps or turbidites deposited from suspension above MTDs (e.g. photo in Fig. 14d). This may lead to a misidentification of the deformed horizon as being surficial rather than sub-surface, with implications for the timing of deformation and earthquakes linked to palaeoseismicity (see Alsop et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\n12\nConclusions\nA range of criteria have been suggested to enable recognition of sandstone and mudstone sills in bedded sequences that are generally deep-marine in origin. In this study, we have applied some of these outcrop criteria to lacustrine sequences, where bedding is generally developed on a finer scale and sediment compositions can be significantly different. These criteria are summarised in Figs. 14 and 15. It is important to recognise sedimentary sills in lacustrine sequences, as misidentification of sills and turbidites would compromise the palaeoseismic history where such lacustrine turbidites are regarded as potentially representing major seismic events in the sediment record. We highlight a number of specific conclusions below.\n\n1)\nWithin this case study, sedimentary sills are considered to be created by increases in fluid pressure generated by seismicity that also triggered the slope failure associated with downslope movement of MTDs and FATS.\n\n\n2)\nThe fluidization and intrusion of sediment injections generated by seismicity and associated MTDs and FATS results in sediment weakening and may further enhance and localize bulk kinematics associated with downslope deformation.\n\n\n3)\nThick detrital beds, MTDs, or units that undergo early cementation (such as gypsum horizons) may act as baffles to fluid flow and thereby locally increase pore fluid pressure. This encourages sills to form and inject directly beneath such baffles.\n\n\n4)\nSills may form along bed-parallel detachments associated with both extensional and contractional deformation. Injection of apophyses to sills along thrust ramps and normal faults suggests that these structures also formed rapidly in the sub-surface.\n\n\n5)\nIntrusion of sills results in deformation of adjacent host beds marked by plucking of clasts from the walls of the sill. Injection of sills also creates recumbent \u2018peel-back\u2019 folds in host strata that form through rolling hinge migration, resulting in overturned limbs longer than the thickness of the sill.\n\n\n6)\nMTD folds initiate by buckling and are strongly modified by simple shear, whereas peel-back folds are created by simple shear with local bending at the hinge. This may explain why peel-back folds adjacent to sills have Class 1B\/1C fold geometries that differ from Class 2 forms in MTDs, despite both being tight-isoclinal and recumbent.\n\n\n7)\nTaken in isolation, the most unique features to sills are erosive upper contacts that cut across laminae in the overlying host sediment, together with bifurcation and segmentation of sills that cut across stratigraphy at different levels. In general, we therefore need to use a broad combination of criteria that collectively may be used to identify sills.\n\n\n8)\nThe application of AMS analysis distinguishes between deposition fabrics in beds and injection or deformation fabric in horizontally injected sills. AMS analysis reveals oblate fabrics with trails of minimum (K\n3) magnetic susceptibility axes indicating intrusion of sedimentary sills parallel to the strike of the palaeoslope and overlying folds and thrusts.\n\n\n9)\nThe consequences of mis-identifying sills are that stratigraphic sequences may be misinterpreted and miscorrelated. If sills injected above sub-surface fold and thrust systems are confused with sedimentary caps deposited from suspension, then the true nature of the sub-surface FATS is missed, with inherent consequences for palaeoseismicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor statement\nG.I.

These contributions are manifested, for example, in scientific articles and particularly in four textbooks (Ramsay, 1967; Ramsay and Huber, 1983, 1987; Ramsay and Lisle, 2000). In the latest textbook, Ramsay and Lisle (2000) wrote: \u201cWe are convinced that the research advances which go on today and which will continue in the future will involve both detailed observations of naturally deformed rock systems together with a deeper appreciation of the theoretical application of mechanics. Both are essential to progress\u201d. They further wrote: \u201cWe have considered carefully the part that computer-based numerical methods should play in the solutions of geomechanical problems and we have come to the conclusion that numerical solutions are more than justified\u201d. In this study, we focus on such computer-based numerical methods to solve the mathematical equations of mechanics which quantify the deformation of natural rock systems.\nUniversity education in structural geology commonly focuses on detailed observations of naturally deformed rock systems, the geometrical classification of structures in deformed rock and the kinematics (i.e. temporal evolution of geometry) associated with the generation of such structures. The mechanical, or dynamical, aspects of rock deformation, especially analytical and computer-based solutions, are commonly not treated to the same extent and detail (e.g. Mukherjee, 2019). However, several authors have emphasized the importance of considering the complete mechanical aspects and computer-based solutions for understanding the formation of geological structures (e.g. Fletcher and Pollard, 1999; Pollard and Fletcher, 2005; Allmendinger, 2011). One reason why analytical and computer-based solutions still often play a minor role only in a structural geology curriculum is likely that the mathematical treatment of supposedly simple mechanical problems, such as the two-dimensional (2D) deformation of elliptical inclusions embedded in a mechanically weaker or stronger matrix, is mathematically already quite complex (e.g. Schmid and Podladchikov, 2003; Pollard and Fletcher, 2005; Jaeger et al., 2007; Moulas et al., 2014). Furthermore, the application of computer-based solutions to mechanical problems of rock deformation requires a basic knowledge of numerical methods and programming, which is often not imparted in a standard structural geology curriculum. Therefore, during their studies many students of structural geology do often not acquire the skills to write a simple computer program which can, for example, calculate the pressure, velocity or strain rate fields for deforming inclusion-host systems. However, computer-based solutions for geomechanical problems are becoming more and more important in academia and industry to predict and quantify rock deformation processes (e.g. Kolditz et al., 2015; Pandey et al., 2018). Particularly, computer-based solutions are important for investigating the coupling between rock deformation, fluid flow and chemical reactions (e.g. Poulet et al., 2012; Kolditz et al., 2015; Pandey et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2020; Schmalholz et al., 2020). Understanding such coupled processes is essential for solving fundamental scientific questions, such as the interplay between metamorphic reactions and rock deformation or between fluid flow and rock deformation, and for solving applied problems concerning, for example, geothermal energy exploitation or permanent storage of carbon dioxide in geological reservoirs (e.g. Matter and Kelemen, 2009).\nHere, we present a simple computer program that numerically solves the mathematical equations describing the 2D viscous deformation of inclusion-matrix systems under pure shear and simple shear (Fig. 1\n). Such inclusion-matrix systems have also been considered in the textbook of Ramsay and Lisle (2000). An overview of many performed analytical, numerical and laboratory-experimental studies of deforming inclusion-matrix systems is given in Jessell et al. (2009). Typical examples of stiff inclusions in a weaker matrix are porphyroclasts or blocky boudins (Fig. 1) as well as crystal-melt mixtures (e.g. Yamato et al., 2015). Examples of weak inclusions in a stronger matrix are all kind of fluid inclusions, partially-molten or molten regions within non-molten rock, such as migmatites (e.g. Saki et al., 2020) or magma chambers, or phyllosilicate-rich metasedimentary units within the continental crust (e.g. Petri et al., 2019). In engineering geology, the rock deformation around open fractures, bore holes or tunnels represents a typical geomechanical problem which can be also considered as an inclusion-matrix system with extremely weak inclusion (e.g. Schmid and Podladchikov, 2003; Jaeger et al., 2007; Moulas et al., 2014). The presented computer program can treat stiff and weak inclusions of any shape and considers linear and power-law viscous flow laws. For simplicity, we do not consider other, but also important, deformation mechanisms such as elastic deformation, or brittle-frictional deformation used to describe faulting by applying a yield criterion, such as the Mohr-Coulomb or the Drucker-Prager yield criterion (e.g. Jaeger et al., 2007). The main aim of our study is to present the mathematical equations, the numerical method and the computer program in a very simple and transparent way, so that our contribution might be used for introductory courses on geomechanical numerical modelling in structural geology.\nA particular challenge in learning computer-based numerical methods is to understand the link between the original equations and the computer program that solves these equations, because these equations are typically completely obscured inside the program by a variety of numerical procedures. Even when the governing equations are understood by the students, the associated computer program solving these equations often appears to the students, in our experience, as non-transparent. In many numerical methods the equations are dismembered (e.g. separation into a coefficient matrix and a vector for the unknown variables) and\/or various external computer codes (so-called libraries) are used which are often unknown to the student. In contrast, in the computer program presented here the original equations are still recognizable so that the link between the governing equations and the computer program is transparent and understandable. The computer program is based on the finite difference method (e.g. Gerya, 2019; Anderson et al., 2020) and we solve the finite difference equations with a simple iterative method (Frankel, 1950). The computer program is written in the programming language MATLAB and provided as supplementary material. This MATLAB program can also be run with the freely available software GNU Octave. It can, hence, be used on any computer without the need for specific software licences or additional software (e.g. compiler).\n\n\n2\nMathematical model\n\n2.1\nGoverning equations of continuum mechanics\nThe investigation of the mechanical aspects of rock deformation with mathematical models requires a system of equations with an equal number of equations and unknown variables which need to be determined. Such a system, also called a closed system of equations, is provided by the concepts of continuum mechanics (e.g. Mase, 1970; Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Pollard and Fletcher, 2005; Gerya, 2019). In continuum mechanics the deformation of materials is described by partial differential equations because it is assumed that the unknown variables vary in space in a continuous manner (e.g. Mase, 1970; Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Pollard and Fletcher, 2005; Gerya, 2019). These equations can be distinguished in three sets of equations: (1) Kinematic equations which describe the motion and deformation of a material, for example, the relation between velocities and strain rates in a fluid. (2) Constitutive equations describing the particular mechanical characteristics of the considered material, for example, the behaviour of a viscous fluid or an elastic solid. These constitutive equations include the material properties such as the viscosity. (3) Conservation equations describing the conservation of mass, linear momentum (representing the force balance) and energy. These conservation equations are independent of the considered material and are valid for solids, fluids and gases.\n\n\n2.2\nKinematics\nThe flow of a viscous material in 2D is quantified by the velocities in the horizontal, V\n\nx\n, and vertical, V\n\ny\n, direction. The deformation of this viscous material is quantified by three strain rates which are calculated from the spatial gradients of the velocity field (e.g. Mase, 1970)\n\n(1)\n\n\nD\n\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nD\n\ny\ny\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nD\n\nx\ny\n\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horizontal dimension is represented by the x-coordinate and the vertical direction by the y-coordinate. Hence, D\n\nxx\n, D\n\nyy\n and D\n\nxy\n are the strain rates in the horizontal and vertical direction and the shear strain rate, respectively. We assume here an incompressible flow without any volumetric deformation. Therefore, the strain rates above are termed deviatoric strain rates which do not cause any volumetric deformation, only shear deformation. Strain rates are spatial gradients of the velocity field and have, hence, physical units of s\u22121.\n\n\n2.3\nConstitutive equations\nThe constitutive equation, or flow law, for a viscous material is given by a mathematical relationship between deviatoric stress and deviatoric strain rate. Such stress-strain rate relationships for natural rocks and minerals are typically derived from rock deformation experiments (e.g. Karato, 2008). The three deviatoric stresses are (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Gerya, 2019)\n\n(4)\n\n\nT\n\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n2\n\u03b7\n\nD\n\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nT\n\ny\ny\n\n\n=\n2\n\u03b7\n\nD\n\ny\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nT\n\nx\ny\n\n\n=\n2\n\u03b7\n\nD\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the effective viscosity of the fluid. The stresses have units of Pa and the effective viscosity has units of Pa s. We assume that T\n\nxy\n\u00a0=\u00a0T\n\nyx\n, or in other words that the stress tensor is symmetric. The symmetry of the stress tensor can be derived from the balance of angular momentum (e.g. Mase, 1970).\nTo formulate the force balance equations, or the conservation equation for linear momentum, we need to know the horizontal and vertical forces. Forces are related to total stresses which in fluid dynamics are typically composed of a mean stress, or pressure, and the deviatoric stresses described above. For example, in 2D the horizontal total stress is the mean stress (average of the horizontal and vertical total stresses) plus the horizontal deviatoric stress. The total horizontal and vertical stresses are (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Gerya, 2019)\n\n(7)\n\n\nS\n\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n\u2212\nP\n+\n\nT\n\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\nS\n\ny\ny\n\n\n=\n\u2212\nP\n+\n\nT\n\ny\ny\n\n\n\n\nwhere P=\u2212(S\n\nxx\n+S\n\nyy\n)\/2 is the negative mean stress. The definition of pressure as negative mean stress is simply a convention often applied in fluid dynamics, but pressure could also be defined as positive mean stress. Only so-called normal stresses acting in the horizontal and vertical direction (having subscripts xx and yy) have a pressure component, because their orientation is parallel to the hydrostatic, or the principal, stress directions. The reason is that fluids at rest (i.e. static situation with no strain rates) can experience a pressure, for example due to gravity, and this pressure only depends on the total normal stresses. Fluids at rest experience no shear stress and no deviatoric stresses because such stresses would cause strain rates (see equations (4)\u2013(6)) and, hence, deformation.\n\n\n2.4\nConservation equations\nWe assume incompressible deformation, as mentioned above, and the equation for the conservation of mass can then be written as (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Gerya, 2019)\n\n(9)\n\n0\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right-hand side of the equation above is also termed the divergence of the velocity field. The two equations for the conservation of linear momentum in the absence of gravity and inertial forces are (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Gerya, 2019)\n\n(10)\n\n0\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nS\n\nx\nx\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\n\nT\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11)\n\n0\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nS\n\ny\ny\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\n\nT\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquations (10) and (11) represent the force balance in the horizontal x- and vertical y-direction, respectively.\n\n\n2.5\nClosed system of equations\nEquations (1)\u2013(11) constitute a closed system of equations with as many equations as unknown variables so that the system of equations can be solved. The 11 unknown variables are: P, V\n\nx\n, V\n\ny\n, D\n\nxx\n, D\n\nyy\n, D\n\nxy\n, T\n\nxx\n, T\n\nyy\n, T\n\nxy\n, S\n\nxx\n, S\n\nyy\n. Only equations (9)\u2013(11) are partial differential equations. These three partial differential equations represent the equations that we will solve numerically for the three unknowns P, V\n\nx\n and V\n\ny\n. If these three unknowns are calculated, then all the remaining 8 unknowns can be calculated using equations (1)\u2013(8). To calculate these three unknowns we will apply, first, a numerical method which approximates all the partial derivatives with ratios of differences (so-called finite differences) and then, second, a numerical solution technique which provides an explicit expression for the unknowns. Selecting pressure and velocities as unknowns, which must be determined, is a typical approach in computational fluid dynamics (e.g. Hughes, 2012; Zienkiewicz et al., 2014). The numerical method and solution technique is explained further below in sections 3.1 to 3.3.\n\n\n2.6\nEffective viscosities\nGenerally, for flow laws the term effective viscosity refers to the ratio of stress to strain rate (e.g. Karato, 2008). The effective viscosity, \u03b7, used in equations (4)\u2013(6) can represent different types of viscous flow. If \u03b7 is constant, then it represents linear viscous (Newtonian) flow and we term here such linear viscosity \u03b7\n\nL\n. Such linear viscous flow is often considered as representative for diffusion creep (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2014).\nFor a non-linear, power-law viscous flow, the effective viscosity depends on the strain rate, or alternatively on the stress. The effective viscosity for a power-law viscous fluid, termed here \u03b7\n\nP\n\n\nL\n, can be written as (e.g. Fletcher, 1974; Schmalholz and Schmid, 2012)\n\n(12)\n\n\n\u03b7\n\nP\nL\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b7\nL\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\nI\nI\n\n\n\nT\nR\n\n\n\n\n1\n-\nn\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b7\n\nL\n is the linear viscosity, T\n\nR\n is a constant reference stress, n is the stress exponent, which for rocks is \u22651, and\n\n(13)\n\n\nT\n\nI\nI\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nT\n\nx\nx\n\n2\n\n+\n\nT\n\ny\ny\n\n2\n\n+\n2\n\nT\n\nx\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\nI\n\n\nI\n is called the square root of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor. This invariant is used because its value is independent on the chosen coordinate system and is, hence, a suitable quantity to describe the stress magnitude in the deforming fluid. If the value of T\n\nI\n\n\nI\n increases, then the value of \u03b7\n\nP\n\n\nL\n decreases. Therefore, regions in the fluid with higher stresses have a smaller effective viscosity than regions in the fluid with smaller stresses. If the stress, T\n\nI\n\n\nI\n, in the fluid is equal to T\n\nR\n then \u03b7\n\nP\n\n\nL\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b7\n\nL\n. If the stress exponent n\u00a0=\u00a01 then \u03b7\n\nP\n\n\nL\n reduces to \u03b7\n\nL\n everywhere in the fluid and the effective viscosity is linear viscous and constant. A power-law viscous flow is often considered as representative for dislocation creep (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2014).\nOften, a combination of linear viscous and power-law viscous flow is assumed for ductile rocks. The viscosity for such combined flow law can be given by the pseudo-harmonic mean of \u03b7\n\nL\n and \u03b7\n\nP\n\n\nL\n (e.g. Gerya, 2019)\n\n(14)\n\n\n\u03b7\nC\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\u03b7\nL\n\n\n+\n\n1\n\n\u03b7\n\nP\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effective viscosity, \u03b7, in equations (4)\u2013(6) can, hence, either be equal to \u03b7\n\nL\n, \u03b7\n\nP\n\n\nL\n or \u03b7\n\nC\n depending on whether a linear viscous, power-law viscous or combined flow law, respectively, should be modelled.\n\n\n2.7\nGeological magnitudes of considered quantities and parameters\nFor applicability reasons, we provide here some typical magnitudes of the involved mechanical quantities in a tectonic context. We consider here viscous deformation only and ignore, for example, visco-elastic effects, fracturing and inertial forces (e.g. generating seismic waves). For such viscous deformation, strain rates vary typically between 10\u221215 to 10\u221212\u00a0s\u22121, but can potentially reach values up to 10\u221210\u00a0s\u22121 (e.g. Pfiffner and Ramsay, 1982; Chernak and Hirth, 2010; Fagereng and Biggs, 2019; Bose and Mukherjee, 2020). Deviatoric stresses vary typically between 1 and few hundreds of MPa, but could locally likely reach values up to 1\u00a0GPa (e.g. Karato, 2008, Table 19.2 therein), especially on the mineral scale (e.g. Angel et al., 2015). Typical effective viscosities for melt-free rock range from 1018 to 1023\u00a0Pa\u00a0s (e.g. Karato, 2008; Liu and Hasterok, 2016). The stress exponent n for power-law viscous flow (equation (12)) is typically 1 for diffusion creep (i.e. linear viscous flow) and between 3 and 5 for dislocation creep (e.g. Karato, 2008, Table 19.1 therein).\n\n\n\n3\nComputer-based numerical model\n\n3.1\nFinite difference method\nThe presented computer program employs the finite difference method. Other numerical methods used in continuum mechanics include, for example, the finite element method (e.g. Hughes, 2012; Zienkiewicz et al., 2014), the discrete element method (e.g. Hardy and Finch, 2005; Sch\u00f6pfer et al., 2009), and the spectral method (e.g. Schmalholz et al., 2001).\nIn the finite difference method the model domain is subdivided, or discretized, into a so-called numerical grid, or mesh (Fig. 2\n). In the so-called staggered finite difference method the unknown variables, here velocities and pressure, are calculated at different positions (e.g. Gerya, 2019). We explain further below why a staggered grid is useful.\nThe finite difference method approximates a partial derivative, with respect to the x- or y-direction, of any variable by the difference of this variable between two neighboring grid points, divided by the distance between these points. For example, the finite difference approximation of the horizontal spatial derivative of the horizontal velocity is\n\n(15)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\nx\n\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nV\n\n\n\nx\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index i represents the number of a grid point (on which a value of the horizontal velocity is stored) along the x-direction. Hence, i varies from 1 to nx, whereby nx is the number of points storing values of the horizontal velocities along the horizontal direction. These grid points are indicated with a square in Fig. 2. The value of dx specifies the horizontal distance between two horizontally neighboring points. Similarly, the index j represents the number of a point along the y-direction and dy specifies the vertical distance between two vertically neighboring points. The employed finite difference method uses an evenly spaced grid so that dx and dy have the same values everywhere in the grid (Fig. 2). Smaller dx and dy increases the spatial resolution and accuracy of the numerical model, but in turn leads to longer calculation times (e.g. Anderson et al., 2020). The spacial resolution needs to be large enough to resolve the geometry of the studied mechanical process (e.g. Anderson et al., 2020).\nEvery partial derivative appearing in the governing equations above is approximated by finite differences. These approximations of the spatial derivatives represent the spatial slope, or gradient, between two neighboring points. This spatial gradient, hence, represents the gradient at a position between two neighboring points. For example, in Fig. 2 the horizontal gradient of the horizontal velocity, defined at the points represented by the squares, is representative for the point horizontally between the squares, which is represented by the black-filled circles (Fig. 2). The horizontal gradient of the horizontal velocity determines the horizontal strain rate, D\n\nxx\n (equation (1)), and hence the values of D\n\nxx\n are stored at the point indicated by the black-filled circles (Fig. 2). The value of D\n\nxx\n multiplied by the value of \u03b7 determines the value of T\n\nxx\n (equation (4)), which is the reason why values of \u03b7 and T\n\nxx\n are stored at the same points (indicated by black-filled circles) as D\n\nxx\n. The same reasoning applies for vertical gradients of vertical velocities (stored at points indicated by triangles in Fig. 2) defining the vertical strain rates. Furthermore, horizontal gradients of the vertical velocities and vertical gradients of the horizontal velocities define the shear strain rate, D\n\nxy\n (equation (3)) and, consequently, values of D\n\nxy\n are stored in the center points between the points storing the horizontal and vertical velocities, which are indicated by crosses in Fig. 2. Therefore, the fundamental reason for staggering (i.e. storing different quantities at different positions of the numerical grid) is that the governing equations, for example the horizontal force balance equation (10), involves both horizontal and vertical derivatives of different variables. The staggering assures that all spatial derivatives used in an equation are representative for exactly the same position in the numerical grid.\n\n\n3.2\nApproximate equations and residuals\nUsing the finite difference approximation, the three conservation equations (9)\u2013(11) can be discretized in the following way (e.g. Richardson, 1911; Frankel, 1950; Duretz et al., 2019)\n\n(16)\n\nR\nE\n\nS\nP\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\nx\n\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nV\n\n\n\nx\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nV\n\n\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(17)\n\nR\nE\n\nS\n\nV\n\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nS\n\nx\n\nx\n\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nS\n\nx\n\nx\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nT\n\nx\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nT\n\nx\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(18)\n\nR\nE\n\nS\n\nV\n\ny\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nS\n\ny\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nS\n\ny\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nT\n\nx\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nT\n\nx\n\ny\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial derivatives are approximated by finite differences and, hence, the conservation equations are not fulfilled exactly so that the left-hand side of the equations is not zero but has an approximation error, which is typically called a residual, for example RES\n\nV\n\n\nx\n in equation (17). We term the residuals for the three conservation equations, RES\n\nP\n, RES\n\nV\n\n\nx\n, and RES\n\nV\n\n\ny\n, respectively.\n\n\n3.3\nIterative solution method\nThe aim of every numerical method is to find such values for the unknown variables so that the residuals of the approximate equations become as small as possible. There is a large variety of different numerical solutions methods (e.g. Anderson et al., 2020). Here, we solve the approximate, or discretized, system of equations iteratively (Frankel, 1950). This means that we start with an initial guess for the unknown velocities and pressures on all grid points. Then, we iteratively (i.e. subsequently step by step) modify the values for the velocities and pressures so long until we found values which provide small enough residuals so that we can consider the numerical solution as accurate for our purpose. The iteration steps, or cycles, are done in the computer program using a so-called \u201cwhile [...] end\u201d loop, in which a computer operation is continuously repeated until a certain criterion is reached, in our case a sufficiently small value of the residuals (Fig. 3\n). The iterative method we use here is similar to the Richardson iterative method (Richardson, 1911; Frankel, 1950) which has been developed more than hundred years ago, before the existence of computers. Originally, the calculations for such iterative methods were done by hand.\nThe residuals in the approximate equations (16)\u2013(18) depend on the values of the three unknown variables. With every new iteration step these values will be modified and the residual becomes smaller and smaller with more and more iteration steps. The values for the new iteration step can be found by assuming that the difference between the values of the new iteration step (P\n\nit\n, \n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\nt\n\n\n and \n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\nt\n\n\n) and the old iteration step (P\n\nit\u22121, \n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\nt\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n and \n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\nt\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n) is proportional to the respective residuals and scaled by some scalar numbers (dpt\n\nP\n, dpt\n\nV\n\n\nx\n and dpt\n\nV\n\n\ny\n) (Richardson, 1911). We choose to use the same scaling dpt\n\nV\n for both velocities and express the residuals as (e.g. Duretz et al., 2019)\n\n(19)\n\nR\nE\n\nS\nP\n\n=\n\n\n\nP\n\ni\nt\n\n\n-\n\nP\n\ni\nt\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\nd\np\n\nt\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(20)\n\nR\nE\n\nS\n\nV\n\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\nt\n\n\n-\n\nV\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\nt\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\nd\np\n\nt\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(21)\n\nR\nE\n\nS\n\nV\n\ny\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\nt\n\n\n-\n\nV\n\n\ny\n\n\ni\nt\n-\n1\n\n\n\n\nd\np\n\nt\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the superscript it indicates the number of the iteration step. One can imagine that the scalars dpt\n\nP\n and dpt\n\nV\n represent the \u201cvirtual\u201d, or \u201cpseudo\u201d, time interval between two consecutive iteration steps. The right-hand sides of equations (19)\u2013(21) have then the finite difference form of discretized \u201cpseudo-time\u201d derivatives. Therefore, we decided to term dpt\n\nP\n and dpt\n\nV\n pseudo-time steps. However, the nomenclature of pseudo-time steps is done here only for illustrative purposes and one could refer to the scalars dpt\n\nP\n and dpt\n\nV\n simply as iteration parameters. When the values of the unknown variables stop varying between two consecutive iteration steps, then the pseudo-time derivatives of these unknowns become zero and, consequently, the residuals become zero so that the approximate equations are solved. The values of the pseudo-time steps depend on the considered model configuration and material parameters. If dpt\n\nP\n and dpt\n\nV\n are too large, the residuals do not converge to small values. If dpt\n\nP\n and dpt\n\nV\n are too small, the residuals converge to small values very slowly. The values suitable for the presented computer simulations are specified in the computer program (Figs. 12 and 13). Each of the three residuals depends on one of the three unknown variables.

During each iteration step, all the values for the pressure and velocities on all the numerical grid points are modified, or updated, according to equations (22)\u2013(24). The iteration steps above are performed so often until the values of the three residuals are smaller than a specified tolerance, or error. When this tolerance is achieved, the current values of the velocities and pressures at the numerical grid points are considered as numerical solution of the 2D viscous flow equations.\n\n\n3.4\nComputer algorithm\nA computer program to solve the differential equations typically consists of three parts: (1) a pre-processor, which defines the model configuration (i.e. geometry, numerical grid etc.), the material properties (e.g. viscosity) and a variety of required numerical parameters (e.g. tolerance for numerical solution etc.), (2) a processor, which approximately solves the system of equations up to a specified numerical accuracy, and (3) a post-processor, which visualizes and saves the numerical results.\nWe focus here on the processor, which consists of the iterative solver. The values for the velocities and pressures at every grid point are stored on the computer in so-called 2D arrays, similar to a matrix. For example, the values of the horizontal velocities are stored in the array termed VX (Fig. 3). This array has two dimensions: Along the first dimension the values along the horizontal x-direction are stored, which are numbered with index i; along the second dimension the values along the vertical y-directions are stored, which are numbered with index j, that is VX(i\u00a0=\u00a01, \u22ef, nx; j\u00a0=\u00a01, \u22ef, ny). In the software MATLAB and GNU octave, the difference between neighboring values stored in a 2D array can be simply calculated with the command termed \u201cdiff\u201d (Fig. 3). The advantage of this command is that it can calculate the difference of neighboring values, say along the x-direction, in a single computer operation. For example, the differences of all horizontal velocity values in array VX along the horizontal, x-direction, is\n\n(25)\n\ndiff\n\n(\nVX\n,\n1\n,\n1\n)\n\n=\n\nVX\n\n(\ni\n+\n1\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n-\n\nVX\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \u201cdiff\u201d operation is applied for all points with numbers i\u00a0=\u00a01, \u22ef, nx\u22121 and j\u00a0=\u00a01, \u22ef, ny simultaneously. The maximal value of index i is nx\u22121 because in the equation above the grid point with number i+1 is used, which is the final grid point when i\u00a0=\u00a0nx\u22121. Similarly, the difference of neighboring horizontal velocity values along the vertical, y-direction is\n\n(26)\n\nd\niff\n\n(\nVX\n,\n1\n,\n2\n)\n\n=\n\nVX\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n-\n\nVX\n\n(\ni\n,\nj\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhich is applied for all i\u00a0=\u00a01, \u22ef, nx and j\u00a0=\u00a01, \u22ef, ny\u22121 simultaneously. Computer operations as performed by the command \u201cdiff\u201d which affect an entire array are called a vectorized operation. The entire iterative solver for linear viscous flow (i.e. constant viscosity) is displayed in Fig. 3. The finite difference equations are programmed in the same order and style as the exact governing equations having partial derivatives. For transparency, the approximate equations in the computer program have the same number as the exact equations presented above. The computer program involving the (i) iteration loop (\u201cwhile [...] end\u201d loop), (ii) the approximate equations, (iii) the calculation of the residuals and (iv) the iterative update of the three unknown variables is just 18 lines long (Fig. 3).\n\n\n3.5\nModel configuration\nWe consider a quadratic model domain with dimensionless parameters (Fig. 4\n). All quantities are made dimensionless with a characteristic length scale, Lx, which is the width of the model, a characteristic time scale, defined by 1\/D\n\nB\n, which is the inverse of the applied far-field pure shear or simple shear strain rate, and a characteristic viscosity, \u03b7\n\nB\n, which is the viscosity of the matrix. All physical quantities in the model can be expressed as a function of these three characteristic values. For example, the x- and y-coordinates are displayed as dimensionless values, x\/Lx, which means that the dimensional x-coordinate (having units of m) is divided by the dimensional model width (having units of m). Also, all values of the pressure, P, and stresses (having units of Pa), are divided by the product 2\u03b7\n\nB\n\nD\n\nB\n (having also units of Pa). The quantity of 2\u03b7\n\nB\n\nD\n\nB\n corresponds to the constant deviatoric stress in a homogeneous material, having viscosity \u03b7\n\nB\n, under far-field pure shear or simple shear with strain rate D\n\nB\n. In other words, all pressures and stresses are measured in units of the deviatoric stress for homogeneous shear. After the simulation, the calculated dimensionless results can be converted back to dimensional values by multiplying the dimensionless values by their characteristic scales. Working with dimensionless parameters has the advantage that the numerical result of a single simulation can be applied to a variety of physical parameters. For example, if the dimensionless pressure has a value of 3 and the result should be applied to a natural situation with a viscosity of 1021\u00a0Pa\u00a0s and a strain rate of 10\u221214\u00a0s\u22121, then the corresponding dimensional pressure would be 60\u00a0MPa (3 \u22c5 2\u03b7\n\nB\n\nD\n\nB\n).\nTo solve the system of equations numerically, we have to specify the values of the unknown variables at the model boundaries, that is, we have to specify so-called boundary conditions (e.g. Gerya, 2019). We apply either a far-field pure shear velocity field at the model boundaries or a simple shear velocity field (e.g. Ramsay and Huber, 1983; Ragan, 2009). Hence, both the horizontal and vertical velocities are defined as boundary conditions at the model boundaries. The model domain consists of a matrix in which stiffer or weaker inclusions are embedded. As initial guess for the unknown velocities, which is required for the first iteration step, we assume that the velocity field in the model domain corresponds to either a homogeneous pure shear or homogeneous simple shear velocity field, depending which far-field velocity boundary conditions are applied. For the pressure, we assume that all values are zero initially. The pressure values at the model boundaries remain zero. Results for specific model configurations are discussed in the following section.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nIn this section we present several applications of the presented computer program to show the impact of the viscosity ratio between inclusion and matrix, the inclusion geometry and the pure shear or simple shear boundary conditions on the resulting stress, pressure and strain rate fields. There exist a large number of numerical studies focusing on such inclusion-matrix systems (e.g. Ramsay and Lisle, 2000; Jessell et al., 2009; Marques et al., 2014), and we show here some representative examples using the presented computer program.\n\n4.1\nCircular inclusion and comparison with analytical solution and finite element model\nTo test the correctness of our iterative finite difference (FD) program, we compare the obtained results with an analytical solution as well as with a tested finite element method (FEM) program.\nFirst, we compare the presented FD program with the analytical solution for a stressed material including a circular hole (Timoshenko and Goodier, 1970). The FD program approximates the hole as a weak inclusion with a viscosity that is 1000 times smaller than the viscosity of the matrix (Schmid and Podladchikov, 2003). We apply horizontal pure shear extension. The computed normalized horizontal total stress fields agree with each other (Fig. 5\nA and B) with both reaching the analytically predicted maximum stress of 3 times the far-field stress above and below the hole (Timoshenko and Goodier, 1970, equation 61 therein). The analytical and numerical solutions are not exactly comparable since the analytical solution is derived for a material with infinite dimension, whereas the numerical solution involves some boundary conditions and a finite size model domain. Nevertheless, the magnitude and distribution of the analytically and numerically calculated stress fields is essentially identical, indicating the correctness of the numerical solution.\nSecond, we compare the presented FD program against a tested FEM program (Schmalholz and Schmid, 2012) for two model configurations, a weak and a strong circular inclusion, for linear viscous flow. The weak inclusion has a viscosity that is 100 times smaller and the strong inclusion a viscosity that is 100 times larger than the viscosity of the matrix. We apply horizontal pure shear shortening. We compare the calculated pressure fields of our program (Fig. 5C and E) with results of the FEM program (Fig. 5D and F). The FEM program uses a so-called unstructured numerical mesh made of triangular cells of different size and orientation. Understanding and programming this FEM program is less obvious, the governing equations are separated into a stiffness matrix and a vector of unknown variables and external libraries are used, e.g. this FEM program needs an additional program to generate the triangular numerical mesh. The pressure field calculated with our FD program agrees with the pressure field resulting from the FEM program.\nThe pressure field in the matrix changes the sign when changing from a strong to a weak inclusion which means that regions showing an increased pressure (positive values) for a strong inclusion show a decreased pressure (negative values) for a weak inclusion, and vice versa. For a strong inclusion the pressure variations around the inclusion are larger than for a weak inclusion. This is due to the abrupt changes of the strain rate at the matrix-inclusion boundary for a strong inclusion where the deformation is close to zero. This boundary essentially behaves like a rigid internal boundary with no-slip. For a weak inclusion the pressure variations are smoother. The inclusion-matrix boundary behaves effectively like an internal free surface. By comparing the results of our program with results from the FEM program we also test the correctness of the boundary conditions since both programs show the same pressure values and distribution along the model boundaries.\nTesting a computer program with analytical solutions or comparing it with results from other computer programs is extremely important, because errors can happen always during programming and often errors in the computer program are not easily recognizable. For example, if there would be a factor 2 error in the numerical results presented in Fig. 5A, then the stress field would look reasonable, and the factor 2 error can only be detected by the comparison with an analytical solution or the comparison with another program.\n\n\n4.2\nRectangular inclusion under pure shear and simple shear\nWith the presented computer program both pure shear and simple shear boundary conditions can be applied. For illustration purposes, we calculated the pressure fields for a strong and inclined rectangular inclusion for pure shear and simple shear (Fig. 6\n). For simple shear, the pressure variations are more localized around the inclusion compared to the pressure variations for pure shear. Also, for simple shear the velocity field indicates a rotational flow of the inclusion with a clock-wise sense, in agreement with the applied simple shear (Fig. 6B).\n\n\n4.3\nPower-law viscous matrix and weak elliptical inclusion\nWe apply a power-law viscous flow law for the matrix which is described by a combined linear and power-law viscous flow law. The boundary conditions impose a horizontal pure shear shortening. To calculate a power-law viscous flow, we have to add a few lines within the iterative solver of our program (Figs. 7, 12 and 13\n). These lines include the equation for the effective power-law viscosity (equation (12)) and for the effective viscosity of a combined flow law (equation (14)). The additional line numbered 6 (Fig. 7) is included to model a combined power-law viscous flow only inside the matrix while the viscosity inside the inclusion is linear viscous. In line numbered 7 it is possible to define a minimum viscosity to limit the viscosity reduction due to the power-law behaviour. The resulting effective viscosity in the matrix varies now as a function of the stress, which is quantified by the value of T\n\nI\n\n\nI\n (Fig. 8\nB). For comparison, we also show results for the same model configuration, but for linear viscous flow (Fig. 8A and C). The power-law viscous flow law has an effect on the pressure field which shows more abrupt changes (Fig. 8D) compared to the pressure field for a linear viscosity (Fig. 8C).\n\n\n4.4\nMultiple inclusions of different shape\nTo show that our program can model multiple inclusions of various shape and strength we present numerical results for a model configuration including circular, elliptical and quadratic inclusions of different orientation (Fig. 9\n). We apply horizontal pure-shear shortening and linear viscous flow. The elliptical and circular inclusions have a viscosity 100 times larger than the one of the matrix and the quadratic inclusions have a viscosity 100 times smaller than the one of the matrix (Fig. 9A). The viscosity contrast of 100 represents an inclusion which is not entirely rigid with respect to the matrix (e.g. Schmid and Podladchikov, 2003). The pressure inside the elliptical inclusions depends on their orientation with respect to the shortening direction (Fig. 9B). The elliptical inclusions can exhibit both higher or lower pressure than the corresponding pressure in a homogeneous matrix without inclusions (which would have a dimensionless value of zero; see also Moulas et al., 2014). Pressure variations are largest around the corners of the quadratic inclusions or the boundaries with largest curvature for the elliptical inclusions. In a matrix with more than one inclusion the pressure variations caused by the inclusions can interact with each other. For example, high pressure is focused in the region between the two inclined ellipses in the bottom left region of the model (Fig. 9B). Similarly, the entire vertical column close to the horizontal center of the model, passing through three weak square inclusions, also constitutes one single connected high pressure zone (Fig. 9B). Interaction between inclusions is further visible by the variation of pressure inside the inclusions. For example, the elliptical inclusion partly embedded in the quadratic inclusion around the model centre shows a strong variation in pressure inside the elliptical inclusion (Fig. 9B).\n\n\n4.5\nInclusion with a more natural shape\nThe presented computer program is not limited to simple inclusion geometries such as circles, ellipses and rectangles, and can consider any geometrical shape, for example, more natural inclusion shapes like the one of the garnet shown in Fig. 10\n. The garnet is assumed to be nearly rigid compared to the surrounding matrix. Hence, a viscosity contrast of 1000 can reasonably well approximate the contrast of a rigid inclusion in a matrix (e.g. Schmid and Podladchikov, 2003). We apply a horizontal pure shear extension and consider linear viscous flow. The pressure variation around the vertical, left side of the inclusion has a different shape than the pressure variations around the corner-like, right side of the inclusion (Fig. 10B). This difference is even more visible in the variation of the horizontal strain rate (Fig. 10C).\nTo better interpret the calculated result, the non-dimensional values can be rescaled (section 3.5) using the characteristic values for length scale (Lx), background strain rate (D\n\nB\n) and background viscosity (\u03b7\n\nB\n). For example, the pressure field (Fig. 10B) ranges from approximately \u22122 to 2 in the non-dimensional unit P\/(2\u03b7\nBDB). Assuming geologically realistic values for the characteristic values, e.g. Lx\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u00a0m, \u03b7\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a01020\u00a0Pa\u00a0s and D\n\nB\n\u00a0=\u00a010\u221213\u00a0s\u22121, the pressure field can be rescaled to range from approximately \u221240\u00a0MPa to 40\u00a0MPa. These pressure values correspond to the so-called dynamic, or tectonic, pressure which needs to be added to the lithostatic pressure to obtain the total pressure for the natural situation (e.g. Mancktelow, 2008). The same calculation can be done for the horizontal deviatoric strain rate (Fig. 10C) which has a maximal value of approximately 3.5 Dxx\/DB. This value is then rescaled to approximately 3.5 \u22c5 10\u221213\u00a0s\u22121. The value of D\n\nxx\n inside the garnet inclusion is zero, indicating that the inclusion is rigid and not deforming.\n\n\n4.6\nBlocky boudinage\nThe last example applicable to blocky boudinage is motivated by the natural boudinage structures shown in Fig. 1E and F and by numerical simulations performed by Mancktelow (2008) (Fig. 6 therein). We apply horizontal pure shear extension, consider linear viscous flow and the viscosity of the boudins is 50 times larger than the ones of the matrix. The vertical gap between the boudins has an aspect ratio of 4 (height to width, Fig. 11\n\n\n). Such calculations of blocky boudinage are among the first numerical calculations applied to geomechanical problems in structural geology (Str\u00f6mg\u00e5rd, 1973; Selkman, 1978; Mancktelow, 2008). The calculated pressure, stress, and strain rate fields are not intuitive (at least for beginners in mechanical modelling of rock deformation structures). There is an underpressure in the gap between the boudins which generates a hydrodynamic suction force (Fig. 11A). This force sucks matrix material into the gap. As a consequence, the horizontal strain rate in the matrix, above and below the gap, shows horizontal compression although the matrix is under far-field extension (Fig. 11B). The gap is filled with less viscous matrix material and, hence, the horizontal deviatoric stress is much lower in the gap than in the blocky boudins (Fig. 11D). However, the horizontal total stress, horizontally-along the boudins and across the weak gap, is more or less continuous (Fig. 11C). This continuation of the horizontal total stress across a weak gap is a consequence of the horizontal force balance across the gap. Such force balance effects have been also proposed as a mechanism to generate tectonic overpressure in weak crustal shear zones (Schmalholz and Podladchikov, 2013). Because the magnitude of the horizontal deviatoric stress in the gap is small (Fig. 11D), the magnitude of the horizontal total stress, and hence of the horizontal force, is controlled by the (absolute) magnitude of the pressure, which is significantly larger than the magnitude of the deviatoric stress (Fig. 11A).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThe presented calculations show that computer-based solutions are useful to understand the distribution of deformation, stress and pressure in inclusion-matrix systems because even simple scenarios of inclusion-matrix systems yield counter-intuitive results with respect to, for example, pressure perturbations. For example, the orientation of elliptical strong inclusions has a major impact on the pressure inside the inclusion (Fig. 9). Depending on the orientation, the pressure in the strong elliptical inclusion can be larger (tectonic overpressure when long axis is parallel to shortening direction; red colored ellipse in top left region of Fig. 9) or smaller (tectonic underpressure when long axis is orthogonal to shortening direction; blue colored ellipse in bottom right region of Fig. 9) than the ambient pressure (see also Moulas et al., 2014). Such pressure variations have been considered as potential explanation for observed variation in peak metamorphic pressure inside structurally coherent tectonic nappes (Luisier et al., 2019; Vaughan-Hammon et al., 2021). Generally, the quantification of stresses and pressure during rock deformation is important because stresses and pressure significantly impact, for example, metamorphic reactions, fluid flow or pressure solution in natural rock (e.g. Wheeler, 2018; Moulas et al., 2019). Furthermore, the calculations involving blocky boudins show that under far-field horizontal pure shear extension the horizontal deviatoric strain rates and stresses can be compressive above and below the gaps separating blocky boudins. These compressive strain rates and stresses are associated with an underpressure in the gap which causes a hydrodynamic suction force, which also explains the difficulty in separating blocky boudins separated by a thin gap (Mancktelow, 2008).\nSuch pressure and stress variations, as mentioned above, are associated with the formation of essentially all structures in deformed rocks (e.g. Ramsay, 1967; Schmalholz and Podladchikov, 1999; Ramsay and Lisle, 2000; Pollard and Fletcher, 2005; Mancktelow, 2008; Schmalholz and Mancktelow, 2016). For simple geometries, such as circular or elliptical inclusions, also analytical solutions exist and a numerical solution is in principle not required (e.g. Jeffery and Filon, 1922; Eshelby and Peierls, 1957; Timoshenko and Goodier, 1970; Pollard and Fletcher, 2005). However, for more natural and irregular geometries and for more complicated flow laws, such as combined linear and power-law viscous flow, numerical solutions are required. Considering more irregular geometries is important, because \u201cthe geometrical form of the competent inclusion clearly has an influence on the pattern of stress orientations in the surrounding medium\u201d (Ramsay and Lisle, 2000). The same applies, of course, for weak inclusions. Therefore, we find that simple computer programs, as presented here, are very useful for students in structural geology in order to better understand the mechanical aspects of rock deformation which control the formation of rock structures.\nThe reason why we chose to present an iterative solver over a direct solver is exclusively for didactic reasons because it is simple and transparent. This simplicity, on the other hand, is the main reason for several disadvantages of the applied solver. These disadvantages are that (i) the solver is not very efficient and needs many iterations to achieve a small tolerance and (ii) it can diverge for significantly different material parameters as applied here so that no solution is found and the applied iterative pseudo-time steps need to be adjusted. There are, of course, more elaborated and efficient iterative solvers (e.g. Duretz et al., 2019; R\u00e4ss et al., 2019; Schmalholz et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), but these are also more difficult to explain to beginners in numerical modelling. An iterative method which is an elaboration of the presented iterative method is the so-called pseudo-transient method (e.g. R\u00e4ss et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). This pseudo-transient method is more robust and efficient, especially when the computer program is run on graphical processing units (GPUs) (R\u00e4ss et al., 2020). The presented iterative solver is a good basis to continue with such more elaborated numerical solution techniques. Furthermore, for simplicity we consider here only the instantaneous situation of a deforming inclusion-matrix system and we do not calculate the time evolution of the system under progressive deformation. Such progressive deformation has been numerically investigated in several studies, for example, to understand the formation of S\u2013C and S\u2013C\u2019 structures (Jessell et al., 2009; Dabrowski et al., 2012) or the crystal-melt segregation in magma (Yamato et al., 2015).\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nWe present a simple computer program to quantify velocities, strain rates, stresses, pressure and the effective power-law viscosity in 2D inclusion-matrix systems under pure shear and simple shear. The advantage of the applied finite difference method and the iterative solver is that the equations describing viscous flow are still recognizable in the computer program because these equations are programmed in the same order and style as the mechanical equations are presented in this article. Therefore, the presented computer program is useful to introduce students of structural geology without background in numerical modelling to the governing equations of viscous flow, the finite difference method, the numerical solution technique and to scientific programming. We hope that this article can motivate students to learn how to generate computer-based numerical solutions of geomechanical problems, which are useful to understand and quantify the physical processes that control natural rock deformation and the associated formation of rock structures.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nAll authors had the idea to write a manuscript which describes a simple computer program to model 2D viscous inclusion-matrix systems, which can be used for teaching in Bachelor and Master courses in structural geology.

Onshore, fractures and faults represent zones of weakness with generally high erodibility, controlling the location of important landscape features such as valleys and fjords. Offshore, similar structures offset sedimentary packages, impacting the permeability and fluid and gas pathways, which have implications for hydrocarbon exploration and CO2 storage projects. Understanding the formation and evolution of fault and fracture patterns in space and time is therefore an important task when we try to resolve the evolution of landscapes or to understand the pathways of fluids and gasses.\nWestern Norway has long been an important site for the study of rift processes and source to sink relationships along passive continental margins. The region is one key area where basement fault and fracture patterns both influence the onshore landscape and impact the distribution of sedimentary packages offshore (Redfield et al., 2005; Fossen et al., 2017, 2021; Scheiber and Viola, 2018). Deciphering the spatial and temporal evolution of complex fault and fracture patterns in metamorphic basement is challenging, and one needs to address the issues that follows: (a) the role of ductile structural precursors (e.g. Walsh et al., 2013; Skytt\u00e4 & Torvela, 2018), (b) the role of reactivation of fault systems under changing stress fields (Redfield et al., 2005; Scheiber and Viola, 2018) and (c) complexities in interpreting K\u2013Ar fault gouge data. The latter requires a good understanding of the thermal evolution of the study area and the complexity of fault zone architecture (Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020).\nIn this study, we aim to unravel the spatial and temporal evolution of fault and fracture patterns in a so-far little-studied key area of Western Norway: the transitional area between the N\u2013S trending North Sea margin in the south and the NE\u2013SW trending M\u00f8re margin in the north (Fig. 1\n). We combine remote sensing lineament analysis with ductile foliation trace mapping to investigate the significance of ductile precursors for the subsequent brittle evolution. We then present an extensive field data set from brittle faults and fractures, highlighting the presence of both newly formed structures and structures reactivating older, ductile precursors. Observations of fault and fracture mineralizations help to constrain the relative timing of faulting activity, and K\u2013Ar fault gouge data provide absolute age constraints on faulting. By applying different approaches of paleostress analysis to our dataset, we then suggest a spatial-temporal model for the brittle evolution of our study area. We show that the area is dominated by strike-slip kinematics and that prominent phases of rifting offshore are less prominent in the onshore realm.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe bedrock in the study area consists of the following elements (Fig. 1): 1) Proterozoic gneisses of the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) (e.g. R\u00f8hr et al., 2004, 2013; Corfu et al., 2014; Wiest et al., 2021), 2) Proterozoic and Paleozoic ortho- and paragneisses of the Caledonian nappes (e.g. Furnes et al. 1990; Corfu and Andersen 2002), and 3) Devonian sedimentary rocks (e.g. Osmundsen and Andersen 2001). The bedrock is highly influenced by the Caledonian orogeny with the subduction of parts of the WGR to ultra-high pressure depths in the Devonian (e.g. Hacker et al. 2003, 2010; Kylander-Clark et al. 2007), translation of the nappes during the collisional phase (e.g. Roberts and Sturt 1980; Hacker and Gans 2005; Corfu et al. 2014), subsequent extensional collapse (e.g. Fossen 1992, 2010; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998) and the associated formation of the Devonian basins (e.g. Seranne and Seguret 1987; Osmundsen et al. 1998; Braathen et al. 2004).\n\n2.1\nDuctile precursor structures\nThe WGR and the overlying Caledonian nappes experienced extensive shearing, folding and doming during the collapse of the Caledonian orogen, starting at about 410\u00a0Ma and leading to the formation of the main ductile precursor structures in the study area (e.g. Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Wiest et al., 2021). Several Devonian shear zones separate the orogenic root of the WGR from the overlying Caledonian nappes and the Devonian basins. The large-scale, corrugated detachment system of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone (NSDZ; e.g. Labrousse et al., 2004; Young, 2018) connects with the Bergen Arc Shear Zone (BASZ) (e.g. Wennberg 1996) to the south (Fig. 1a). The M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex (MTFC, Seranne, 1992), the Nordfjord Shear Zone (NSZ, Hacker et al., 2010) and the Lom Shear Zone (LSZ, Wiest et al. 2021) all show mostly ductile sinistral kinematics and acted as strike-slip transfer zones during transtensional collapse (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Wiest et al., 2021). These structures are reflected in the regional foliation trends. Foliation trace mapping based on published foliation measurements shows E\u2013W to NE\u2013SW-striking foliations north of and along the Nordfjord, and E\u2013W to NW\u2013SE-striking foliations south of the Nordfjord, with several domes developed in the WGR (Figs. 2 and 3\na; Wiest et al., 2021). The foliation is dominantly flat to gently dipping, but steeper dips occur as well (Supplementary 1).\n\n\n2.2\nBrittle faulting\nFrom the Devonian onwards, the ductile structural pattern has been overprinted by repeated episodes of brittle faulting (Gabrielsen et al., 2002; Fossen et al., 2017, 2021; Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018), including the brittle reactivation of major ductile shear zones. North of the study area, the MTFC has shown repeated brittle activity in the Late Devonian, Permo-Triassic, Mid- and Late Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Cenozoic (Redfield et al., 2004, 2005; Osmundsen et al., 2006). Similar repeated activity has been documented from other regional faults: the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment fault in the Permian and Jurassic-Cretaceous (Braathen et al., 2004), the Dalsfjord fault (DF) in Late Permian-Early Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous times (Torsvik et al., 1992; Eide et al., 1994; Fossen et al., 2021), and the L\u00e6rdal-Gjende fault (LGF) in Permian, Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and the Paleocene (Andersen et al., 1999; Fossen et al., 2017; Tartaglia et al., 2020). Detailed analyses of minor fault zones and fracture patterns, mainly south of our study area, revealed early Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic-Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene episodes of brittle faulting (Ksienzyk et al., 2014, 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Scheiber et al., 2019; Fossen et al., 2021).\n\n\n2.3\nBrittle evolution offshore\nThe onshore fault activity relates to two well-constrained phases of rifting in the North Sea (Steel and Ryseth, 1990; Roberts et al., 1995; F\u00e6rseth, 1996): 1) rift phase 1 during the Permian and Early Triassic affecting a wide area and showing general E\u2013W extension, and 2) the more localized rift phase 2 during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of which the extension direction is controversial. Several suggestions have been made for the latter, including E\u2013W extension (Bartholomew et al., 1993; Reeve et al., 2015), NE\u2013SW extension (F\u00e6rseth, 1996; F\u00e6rseth et al., 1997), or one or two phases of rotation throughout the rift phase (Dor\u00e9 et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2001). Similar phases of rifting have also been suggested for the M\u00f8re Margin in the Norwegian Sea (Talwani and Eldholm, 1972; Grunnaleite and Gabrielsen, 1995; G\u00f3mez et al., 2004; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017): 1) a first rift phase is constrained to early Permian-Early Triassic with a ENE-WSW extension direction, 2) a major NW\u2013SE directed rift phase in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, suggested to have ended by mid-Cretaceous, and 3) a last stretching event in Late Cretaceous and Palaeocene leading to the final break-up between Greenland and Eurasia in the Eocene. In this study, we aim at deciphering the structural evolution of the onshore transition zone between the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea rift systems.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nRemote sensing\nWe conducted foliation trace analysis and lineament mapping in ArcGIS to acquire an overview of the structural architecture of the region. We used foliation traces drawn by Wiest et al. (2021), which were manually interpolated between field measurements of foliations stored in the 1:50\u00a0000 and 1:250\u00a0000 bedrock map database of the Geological Survey of Norway (NGU). Manual extraction of lineaments is a qualitative method where the results depend on the operator, what map sources are used, and the scale used for mapping (Scheiber et al., 2015). Manual extraction of lineaments was conducted by the first author on digital elevation models (DEMs) and on vertical derivatives of the topography which is a map source not sensitive to illumination direction and was made in Seequent Oasis Montaj (Supplementary 2). Orthophotos were used to study specific lineaments in more detail and, in some cases, hillshaded DEMs were used for further analysis.\nA conservative approach was applied where only distinct linear topographic bedrock features that clearly represent the expression of brittle bedrock structures were included in the lineament map (see Supplementary 2). Lineament mapping was performed at three different scales (1:300\u00a0000, 1:200\u00a0000 and 1:100\u00a0000) and is presented as a synthesis map with lineaments from all scales (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.2\nStructural field work\nOur foliation trace and lineament analysis served as a base for choosing areas for fieldwork. In the field, we systematically collected fault and fracture data, including orientation, slip line orientation, fault rock type, fracture surface mineralization, sense of slip, geometric relation to the local foliation, and if present, signs of reactivation. For the sense of slip, we attributed each fault-slip measurement with a value based on confidence and preservation (C \u2013 certain, P \u2013 probable, S \u2013 supposed, X \u2013 unknown). We also collected fault gouge samples for K\u2013Ar geochronology.\n\n\n3.3\nK\u2013Ar fault gouge dating\nThe K\u2013Ar fault gouge analyses including separation into grain size fractions, XRD characterization and K\u2013Ar dating were carried out at the Geological Survey of Norway and a detailed method description is provided in the supplementary material (Supplementary 3). The samples were separated into five grain size fractions before dating: 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm, 2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.4\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm and <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm. The mineralogical composition of each fraction was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were also inspected in terms of possible illite polytypes that may represent different generations of illite (Grathoff and Moore, 1996).\nTo study the mineralogical and crystallographic properties of the fault gouge samples, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at the Elmilab, University of Bergen. The gouge samples were first encapsulated in epoxy and surfaces were polished. Backscatter electron imaging (BSE) was done using a Zeiss Supra 55 VP. Element mapping and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was done by using a Thermo Fisher X-ray detector and the Pathfinder software. Only the fractions of 2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm and 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm were studied under the SEM. The other fractions were too fine grained and did not reveal any useful information.\n\n\n3.4\nPaleostress analysis\nObservations of a brittle fault's plane and slip line orientation together with kinematic information can be used to deduce a local stress tensor under which the fault has formed (Angelier, 1979; Lacombe, 2012; Sim\u00f3n, 2019). When performing paleostress analysis, the measured kinematic data are inverted into a single reduced stress tensor. The stress tensor provides information about the orientation of the principal stress axes (\u03c31\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u03c33) and the stress ratio R. R indicates the relative magnitude of the principal stresses and is defined as (\u03c32 - \u03c33)\/(\u03c31 - \u03c33) (Angelier, 1984).\nTo perform paleostress analysis, we used the program WinTensor by Delvaux and Sperner (2003). The dataset was divided into local stations based on location size and number of included fault and fracture measurements. In Win Tensor, we did the following procedure: First, we applied the Right Dihedron method, which finds the best fit stress tensor for a given number of field measurements and which removes outliers. The selected stress tensor was further analysed with the Rotational Optimization method, where the stress tensor is iteratively adjusted to the data set. During this step, fault planes containing slip lineations but lacking information about sense of movement were also included. For each subset, measurements exceeding an alpha misfit angle of 17\u00b0 were rejected as suggested by Sim\u00f3n (2019). Alpha is the angle between the measured slip line and the theoretical slip direction according to the resolved shear stress on the plane. To evaluate the resulting stress field, we used the modified stress index regime R' (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003). R\u2032 is a numerical parameter ranging from 0 to 3: extensional stress regime (\u03c31 vertical) when R'\u00a0=\u00a0R; strike-slip stress regime (\u03c32 vertical) when R'\u00a0=\u00a02 \u2013 R; and compressional stress regime (\u03c33 vertical) when R'\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a0R (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003). The following five categories of stress tensors are used (after Mattila and Viola (2014)): pure extension, R'\u00a0=\u00a00\u20130.75, transtension, R'\u00a0=\u00a00.75\u20131.25, pure strike-slip, R'\u00a0=\u00a01.25\u20131.75, transpression, R'\u00a0=\u00a01.75\u20132.25, and pure compression, R'\u00a0=\u00a02.25\u20133.\nFollowing the first order paleostress analysis at the local stations, we perform significance tests for the individual local stress tensors according to Orife and Lisle (2006). We arrange the test results according to amount of included fracture and fault measurements and the average alpha value. Further, we categorize the individual measurements of each station by fault surface mineralization and redo the paleostress analysis. The resulting local stress tensors are again tested according to Orife and Lisle (2006), a procedure suggested by Sim\u00f3n (2019).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nBased on the large-scale ductile architecture of the study area, we divide the study area into six subareas (Fig. 2): subarea A encompasses the area north of the NSDZ and NSZ; subarea B comprises the area along Nordfjord including the NSZ and parts of the NSDZ; subarea C represents the Bremanger Granitoid Complex dated to 440\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma (Hansen et al., 2002), which does not contain a ductile precursor foliation due to its high structural position within the Caledonian nappe stack; subarea D comprises the NSDZ south and east of the Hornelen Devonian basin; subarea E encompasses the most inland parts of the study area dominated by N\u2013S trending valley systems; and subarea F includes the southernmost part of the field area east of the NSDZ and north of the Sognefjord.\n\n4.1\nLineament mapping\n\nFig. 2 shows the lineaments identified within the different subareas. Three main lineament orientation trends are visible (Fig. 3b): 1) N\u2013S (yellow in Fig. 3), 2) NE\u2013SW (blue in Fig. 3) and 3) E\u2013W (red in Fig. 3). In subarea A, the NE\u2013SW trend dominates, whereas in subareas B and D, the E\u2013W trend dominates, following mainly the trend of the ductile foliation. In subareas C, E and F, the N\u2013S trend dominates, clearly cutting the trend of the main foliation (Fig. 3a and b).\n\n\n4.2\nField observations\nWe collected structural data from brittle faults and fractures at 620 field localities, representing 1385 individual fault and fracture surfaces with fault mineralizations and 452 slip lines on fault planes (Fig. 2, Supplementary 4). In general, the three main orientation trends identified from lineament mapping are also present in the field measurements within each subarea, except for the E\u2013W trend in subarea B, which is missing in the field data (Fig. 3b and c). The E\u2013W lineament trend in subarea B is therefore more likely an effect of the pervasive E\u2013W ductile foliation trend (Fig. 3a). In addition, the field measurements show that N\u2013S striking faults and fractures are more pronounced throughout the study area than what the lineament mapping shows, except for subarea D, where this trend is missing in the field data as well (Fig. 3b and c). The NW\u2013SE striking fractures and faults are minor in all subareas (green in Fig. 3).\nAt each location, we studied the relationship between the orientation of brittle faults and fractures and the local foliation. In subareas A, B and F, the NE\u2013SW fractures strike generally parallel to subparallel to the local foliation, whereas in subareas D and E, the E\u2013W brittle structures strike parallel to subparallel to the foliation. In general, the dip of the foliation is moderate to shallow, which is different from the steep dip of the fractures and faults (Supplementary 1). The N\u2013S striking faults and fractures cut the local foliation throughout the study area.\nThe dip of the measured faults and fractures is generally steep (Fig. 4\n and Supplementary 1). The slip line trends vary throughout the study area, depending on the strike of the corresponding faults, with a generally shallow plunge (Fig. 4). Slip line orientations show predominantly strike-slip kinematic indicators, with 248 strike-slip dominated faults, 125 oblique-slip faults and 79 dip-slip dominated faults observed (Fig. 2).\nBased on observed fault and fracture mineralizations, we assigned our field measurements to seven different groups, sorted according to inferred high-to low-temperature mineralizations (Figs. 4 and 5\n): 1) Discrete fracture surfaces characterized by aligned muscovite\/biotite and\/or stretched quartz, feldspar and hornblende (stretched host rock, SHR) were mostly observed in subareas B, E and F (Figs. 4a and 5a). The stretching of these minerals must have happened under relatively high-temperature and thus semi-ductile conditions. These surfaces are, in places, covered by epidote, chlorite and\/or quartz mineralizations (Fig. 5b). SHR surfaces have variable dip angles and they have been found both cutting and being parallel to the foliation with variable strike orientation (Fig. 4a). The observed kinematic indicators are mainly dextral or sinistral strike-slip to oblique-slip. 2) Surfaces with epidote, chlorite and\/or quartz are the most common mineralizations in all subareas (Figs. 4b and 5c). These surfaces do not show clear orientation trends. Steeply dipping surfaces showing slip lines with shallow plunge and strike-slip movements seem to be more abundant. Some of these surfaces contain two generations of slip lines (Fig. 5d). 3) Surfaces with zeolite mineralizations occur throughout the study area (Fig. 4c). The zeolite mineralizations vary in colour from white to pink to orange and occur as euhedral radial crystals or as striated fibres (Fig. 5e\u2013g). Zeolite often occurs on top of epidote and chlorite mineralizations and is the apparent younger mineral (Fig. 5e). The zeolite surfaces are commonly steeply dipping and generally strike N\u2013S or NE\u2013SW to E\u2013W, and when found alone, they rarely show any slip lines (Fig. 4c). 4) Surfaces with hematite are more common in the northern field area and are commonly found together with dark green chlorite (Figs. 4d and 5h). These surfaces have similar orientations and sense of shear as the surfaces with epidote, chlorite and\/or quartz (grey, Fig. 4d). 5) Surfaces with calcite (Fig. 5i\u2013j) are most common in subarea B (Fig. 4e). The calcite appears as thin mineral coatings or as bigger crystals, and both alone on surfaces or together with any of the above-mentioned mineralizations. If occurring together with other mineralizations, calcite is normally found on top and seems to be the younger mineral (Fig. 5i). We rarely observed slip lines on calcite, and no kinematic indicators were observed (Fig. 4e). 6) Faults containing cataclasite and\/or uncohesive fault rock such as breccia and gouge occur throughout the study area, with most observations in subarea B (Figs. 4f, 5k and 6). These faults show variable orientations with shallow to steep dips. Slip lines and kinematic indicators were rarely observed on the fault surfaces in direct contact with the gouge. If observed, it was commonly seen on other surface minerals and is plotted in the corresponding mineral stereoplot in Fig. 4 and only shown in grey for Fig. 4f. The observed cataclasites represent 5\u201380\u00a0cm thick zones of crushed host rock containing minerals like chlorite, epidote, K-feldspar, and zeolite (Fig. 5k). 7) A smaller group of faults contains other minerals like talc, K-feldspar or pyrite (Figs. 4 and 5l).\n\n\n4.3\nK\u2013Ar gouge dating\nIn total, 56 gouges from 43 different faults were sampled (Fig. 1b). We collected gouges from all the three main fracture orientation trends observed (Figs. 3c and 4f). Six samples from the two most dominant gouge-bearing fault sets were selected for K\u2013Ar gouge dating (i.e., N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW trending, representing the trend of the North Sea and M\u00f8re margins, respectively). For both the N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW trending fault sets, we chose to analyse three samples representing the coastal, central and inland region of the study area, respectively (Fig. 1b). Detailed results from XRD analyses are shown in Supplementary 5.\n\n4.3.1\nN\u2013S striking faults\n\n4.3.1.1\nVAH_116_1\nSample VAH_116_1 is from a W-dipping fault in the unfoliated Bremanger granodiorite that is exposed within a quarry (Figs. 1b and 6a\n). The main fault plane dips moderately towards the W (263\/39, dip azimuth\/dip) and contains slip lines oriented 263-45 (plunge direction-plunge) associated with normal (W-down) dip-slip kinematic indicators. Slickensides were observed on striated white zeolite on the fault plane. The sharp fault scarp can be followed for about 150\u00a0m, and the width of the exposed fault core is ca. 1\u20131.5\u00a0m (Fig. 6a). At the sample locality, the fault core consists of fault breccia with variable clast sizes, layers of gouge as well as layers of coarse-grained orange zeolite crystals. We sampled a ca. 3\u20136\u00a0cm thick gouge layer close to the hanging wall (Fig. 6a). The three larger grain size fractions contain smectite, quartz, K-feldspar, chlorite, illite\/muscovite and plagioclase (Fig. 7\na). BSE imaging of the coarsest fraction shows smectite replacing K-feldspar crystals (Fig. 7a). The two finest grain size fractions of the sampled gouge consist of smectite with possible traces of illite\/muscovite. Palygorskite may also be present as inferred from its characteristic peak at 10.4\u00a0\u00c5 (Supplementary 6). The K\u2013Ar dates show a slightly convex-upward age spectrum ranging from 155\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1\n, Fig. 8\na).\n\n\n4.3.1.2\nVAH_53_3\nSample VAH_53_3 is from a fault zone located along Rv651 north of Nordfjord (Figs. 1b and 6b). The host rock is a banded gneiss with a foliation oriented 128\/56. The fault itself measures 075\/85 with slip lines oriented 159-15. The fault shows strike-slip movement through slip lines on calcite but kinematic indicators were not observed. The fault consists of one 10\u201340\u00a0cm wide fault strand containing gouge and clasts of host rock and calcite. All grain size fractions are poorly crystalline as shown by broad diffractions peaks with low intensities. The two coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain mainly smectite with subordinate K-feldspar, chlorite and minor quartz, whereas the three finest grain size fractions are entirely dominated by smectite (Table 1; Fig. 7b). The finest fraction is monomineralic. BSE imaging of the coarsest fraction shows K-feldspar with smectite replacement textures (Fig. 7b). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum with dates ranging from 124\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8a). The three coarsest fractions overlap within their uncertainties with a mean age of 123\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n4.3.1.3\nVAH_267_2\nSample VAH_267_2 is from a fault zone located along E39 at the southern end of Votedalen (Figs. 1b and 6c). The monzonitic host rock has a foliation oriented 125\/30. The entire outcrop is cross-cut by subvertical fractures coated with pink zeolite crystals and, in some places, calcite minerals in the centre (Fig. 6c, insert). There are two zones of fault breccia, where one also contains gouge. The orientation of the gouge-bearing zone is 261\/65 with a slip line of 355-13. The fault shows strike-slip movement on striated pink zeolite but kinematic indicators were not observed. The brecciated zone also contains epidote. Only four grain-size fractions could be extracted from the gouge sample (Table 1, Fig. 7c). The three coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain smectite, illite\/muscovite, plagioclase, zeolite, pyroxene, quartz, chlorite, and minor rutile, whereas the finest grain size fraction is monomineralic and consists entirely of smectite (Table 1, Fig. 7c). From XRD, the two coarsest fractions contain the 2M1 illite polytype (Supplementary 6). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum ranging from 240\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 158\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8a).\n\n\n\n4.3.2\nNE\u2013SW striking faults\n\n4.3.2.1\nVAH_198\nSample VAH_198 is from a fault zone located along road 653 close to Volda (Figs. 1b and 6d). The host rock is a dioritic gneiss with a foliation oriented 071\/47. The fault is located close to a lens of amphibolitic gneiss. The fault zone is approximately 2\u00a0m wide and consists of five fault branches, where two of these contain gouge and are separated by fractured host rock (Fig. 6d). The sampled fault has an orientation of 122\/80 and a slip line of 204-25. The fault shows strike-slip movement on striated K-feldspar, but no sense of shear was observed. The coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain biotite, smectite, K-feldspar, chlorite, plagioclase, zeolite and traces of amphibole, whereas the finest grain size fraction consists of biotite, chlorite and smectite (Fig. 7d). Biotite was identified with XRD according to its 5\u00a0\u00c5\/10\u00a0\u00c5 peak proportion (Supplementary 6). The presence of biotite is also supported by chemical data from ICP-OES analyses which show high concentrations of both Fe and Mg in contrast to Al. The smectite content decreases with decreasing grain size fraction, whereas biotite content increases (Fig. 7d). BSE imaging from the coarsest fraction shows fractured K-feldspar decomposing along its rims (Table 1, Fig. 7d). The K\u2013Ar dates show a slight convex-upward age spectrum ranging from 194\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 180\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.3.2.2\nVAH_58\nSample VAH_58 is from a fault zone located along road Rv651 north of Nordfjord close to a major NE\u2013SW trending lineament crossing the valley (Figs. 1b and 2). The host rock is a banded gneiss with a foliation of 134\/61. The fault zone is about 1\u00a0m wide and exhibits two slip planes containing incohesive fault rock and having sharp boundaries to the host rock (Fig. 6e). The orientation of the sampled fault is 122\/55 with a slip line of 122-55. The fault shows dip-slip movement on striated K-feldspar, but kinematic indicators were not observed. The fault zone shows K-feldspar mineralization on the fault surface. The coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain epidote\/clinozoisite, chlorite, smectite, plagioclase, K-feldspar and quartz, whereas the finest fraction consists mainly of smectite, with minor chlorite (Fig. 6e). BSE imagining from the coarsest fraction shows fractured and cracked K-feldspars (Fig. 6e). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum ranging from 191\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.3.2.3\nVAH_250_2\nSample VAH_250_2 is from a fault zone exposed along the construction road to the top of the Loen skylift at the innermost Nordfjord (Fig. 1b). The host rock is a monzonitic augen gneiss with a foliation oriented 033\/46. A 5\u20136\u00a0m long fault scarp is exposed along the road (Fig. 6f). The fault measures 336\/60 and the slip line is 261-19. The fault shows strike-slip movement on a fault surface containing striated chlorite, quartz and white to orange zeolite, but kinematic indicators were not observed. The fault plane bends off from an about 2\u00a0m wide zone of cataclastic rock containing clasts of the host rock, epidote, chlorite, zeolite, K-feldspar, and calcite in a matrix of epidote, chlorite, zeolite, K-feldspar and quartz (Fig. 5k). The sampled gouge layer is 10\u201315\u00a0cm thick and is partly covered with superficial deposits (Fig. 6f). The coarser fractions of the sampled gouge contain chlorite, K-feldspar, smectite, zeolite, epidote\/clinozoisite, plagioclase and quartz, whereas the finest grain size fraction consists of smectite, chlorite, zeolite and K-feldspar (Fig. 7f). BSE imaging of the coarsest fraction shows K-feldspar being replaced by smectite (Fig. 7f). The K\u2013Ar dates show an inclined age spectrum ranging from 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma for the coarsest fraction (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) to 129\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma for the finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) (Table 1, Fig. 8b).\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation\n\n5.1\nInterpretation of K\u2013Ar fault gouge age spectra\nIn recent studies, the \u201cAge Attractor Model\u201d (Torgersen et al. 2015a; Viola et al. 2016) has been used to explain how an inclined age spectrum (K\u2013Ar age vs. grain size fraction) defines a mixing curve between two end-members; the coarsest grain size fraction representing inherited host rock or early grown K-bearing minerals, and the finest grain size fraction representing K-bearing minerals formed under the last detectable faulting\/fluid alteration event. The amount of authigenic K-bearing mineral phases increases with decreasing grain size and the finest fraction (here <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) is generally interpreted to represent the last event of faulting (Torgersen et al., 2015a; Viola et al., 2016; Tartaglia et al., 2020). This model serves as a useful first-order interpretation, but several additional complexities have to be addressed when interpreting K\u2013Ar age spectra as described in the following.\nFirstly, all different K-bearing mineral phases which contribute to the age have to be identified, with possibly several inherited and several authigenic phases. Secondly, the effect of inherited K-bearing minerals from the host rock has to be estimated (e.g. Zwingmann et al. 2010), and thirdly, the possibility for fault reactivation and the generation of more than one phase of authigenic K-bearing minerals has to be taken into account (Torgersen et al., 2015a; Viola et al., 2016; Fossen et al., 2021).\n\n5.1.1\nK-bearing mineral phases\nOur mineralogical dataset shows that the following K-bearing minerals can contribute to the K\u2013Ar dates: K-feldspar (up to 20\u00a0wt% in some fractions), biotite (up to 65\u00a0wt% in some fractions), illite\/muscovite (up to 22\u00a0wt% in some fractions), smectite (up to 100\u00a0wt% in some fractions), and zeolite (up to 14\u00a0wt% in some fractions). Biotite, illite\/muscovite and K-feldspar have known average K-contents of 9\u00a0wt%, 6\/10\u00a0wt% and 14\u00a0wt%, respectively (Barthelmy, 2014). Smectite and zeolite are generally considered not to contain K in their crystal structure (Howie et al., 1992). It is, however, common to find smectite intercalated with illite due to smectite illitization (Altaner and Ylagan, 1997), which can be difficult to identify with XRD analysis at low concentrations (Bense et al., 2014; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber et al., 2019). For fractions consisting entirely of smectite, but giving a well-defined K\u2013Ar date, we therefore assume that the K-content in these fractions can be assigned to illite interlayers in smectite.\n\n\n5.1.2\nThe effect of inheritance\nThe gneisses of the WGR commonly contain K-feldspar, and this mineral is therefore an obvious candidate for inheritance in our samples. Dunlap and Fossen (1998) and Walsh et al. (2013) showed that the K-feldspar in the WGR cooled through \u223c400\u00a0\u00b0C at 400\u2013330\u00a0Ma and through \u223c200\u00a0\u00b0C at 330\u2013230\u00a0Ma. If a fraction consists solely of inherited K-feldspar, the K\u2013Ar date should be the age at closure temperature (200\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C, Reiners et al. (2017)). Alternatively, K-feldspar might be an authigenic growth phase depending on fluid geochemistry and PT conditions during faulting (Brockamp and Clauer, 2013; Torgersen et al., 2015b). In this case, euhedral crystal growth might be expected. From BSE images, we see that the K-feldspars (at least in the coarsest fractions) in our samples do not show crystal faces, but are rather replaced by smectite or fractured and decomposed along edges, indicating that they might represent inherited grains. Finally, inherited K-feldspar might have isotopically re-equilibrated during faulting (Zwingmann et al., 2010), and might even show younger cooling ages than the actual timing of faulting if the faulting temperature was higher than the closure temperature of K-feldspar (Koehl et al., 2018).\nBiotite is another candidate for inheritance and is abundant in sample VAH_198. Biotite is abundant in the host rock of this fault gouge, and it is therefore probable that at least some of the biotite is inherited. Earlier K\u2013Ar biotite dating from within the study area showed cooling of biotite through 300\u00a0\u00b0C at about 340\u00a0Ma (Lux, 1985). K\u2013Ar dating of biotite is, however, complicated (Kelley, 2002) and the interpretation of this age should be done with caution. If the biotite is inherited, we would expect to see the 340\u00a0Ma cooling age reflected in the K\u2013Ar gouge data from the coarsest fraction. Authigenic formation of biotite in fault gouge has not been documented in the literature so far, but cannot be excluded depending on fluid chemistry and PT conditions during faulting.\nIllite is commonly interpreted to represent an authigenic phase in fault gouges if located in crystalline and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Out of all the studied samples, VAH 267_2 appears to be the only one whose two coarsest fractions comprise 2M1 illite (Supplementary 6). Thus, we cannot rule out inheritance of host-rock muscovite. Muscovite is usually assumed to have an Ar closure temperature of \u223c350\u00a0\u00b0C (Harrison et al., 2009) and within the study area, muscovite 40Ar\u201339Ar ages are about 380\u2013400\u00a0Ma (Chauvet and Dallmeyer, 1992; Walsh et al., 2013). If some inherited muscovite is present, we would expect to see the dates of the coarsest fractions to converge towards the muscovite cooling ages, potentially making the dates older than the actual faulting age. However, depending on the PT conditions of faulting, inherited muscovite might become isotopically reset during faulting (Zwingmann et al., 2010).\nSmectite, like illite, is generally assumed to represent an authigenic phase in a gouge in magmatic or high-grade metamorphic host rocks, since it is a low-T mineral formed under diagenetic or hydrothermal processes (Reid-Soukup and Ulery, 2018).\nZeolite is a common product of low temperature (<250\u00a0\u00b0C) interaction between fluids and crustal rocks (Weisenberger and Bucher, 2010), and is therefore generally interpreted to represent an authigenic growth phase during low-temperature faulting. Zeolite has earlier been documented in fault zones in Norway (Tartaglia et al., 2020). Zeolites do commonly contain very little K, and we therefore assume the influence of zeolite on the K\u2013Ar gouge dates to be minor.\n\n\n5.1.3\nFault reactivation\nReactivation of a fault can potentially lead to several generations of authigenic illite\/smectite growth, adding additional complexity to the already complex mixing between inherited and authigenic phases. Unravelling the contribution from inherited or partly re-equilibrated phases versus potentially several generations of authigenic phases is in many cases not unequivocally possible, and many K\u2013Ar dates potentially represent mixed dates not representing any faulting event. We therefore in the following use a conservative approach, and state that some mixing cannot be ruled out even for the finest fractions.\n\n\n5.1.4\nN\u2013S striking faults\n\n5.1.4.1\nVAH_116_1\nIn this sample, smectite, K-feldspar and illite\/muscovite contribute to the K\u2013Ar dates. The cracked and irregular K-feldspars partly replaced by smectite are interpreted to represent inherited grains from the host rock. The three coarser fractions that contain K-feldspar have similar mineralogical compositions and yield dates of 155\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm), 152\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm) and 169\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (0.4\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm). These dates correspond mainly to K-feldspar and illite\/muscovite in the samples, since those have a much higher K-content than smectite. Both K-feldspar and illite\/muscovite might be either inherited from the host rock, (partially) reset or authigenic. We choose therefore not to attribute much significance to these dates. The two finer fractions contain smectite and illite\/muscovite with dates of 148\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm) and 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm). We interpret the date from the 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction to result from mixed generations of authigenic illite and smectite, and the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction to reflect authigenic smectite with interlayered illite grown during faulting at 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8a). Due to possible traces of illite\/muscovite in this fraction, we consider this a maximum age of faulting.\n\n\n5.1.4.2\nVAH_53_3\nIn this sample, smectite and K-feldspar contribute to the K-content. Dates for the three coarser fractions are similar and plot around 123\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma. Earlier studies (e.g. Torgersen et al. 2015a, 2015b; Scheiber et al., 2019; Fossen et al., 2021) interpreted similar overlapping dates among fractions to represent an extensive faulting event. The K-content from smectite is minor compared to K-feldspar, indicating that the K-feldspar should have an important control on the resulting dates. BSE imaging (Fig. 7b) shows that K-feldspar in the 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm fraction gets replaced by smectite and does not show euhedral crystal shapes as expected if authigenic. That all three grain size fractions yielded identical ages within the age uncertainties, despite variable K-content, suggests that the K-feldspar was isotopically reset at c. 123 Ma, which we tentatively interpret as an earlier period of activity along this fault (Fig. 8a). Similar ages have been detected elsewhere in Western Norway (Fig. 8c, Supplementary 8) and it is also similar to the ca. 115 Ma faulting age from VAH_116 (see above). The two finer fractions contain only smectite, where we interpret the 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction to be a mixed date rather than an individual faulting event and the youngest age of 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) to represent an age of faulting (Fig. 8a).\n\n\n5.1.4.3\nVAH_267_2\nVAH_267_2 did not yield an <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fraction. The coarser fractions contain illite\/muscovite, plagioclase and zeolite, whereas smectite is the only K-bearing mineral in the 0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm fraction. The decreasing content of illite\/muscovite with fraction size indicates that this might be an inherited muscovite component, which is further supported by the 2M1 illite in the coarsest fractions (Supplementary 6). We assume the K-contribution from plagioclase to be minor. The inherited muscovite, together with the inclined age spectrum indicates that the dates of the three coarser fractions represent mixed ages. We interpret the monomineralic finest fraction (0.1\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcm) to represent authigenic smectite\/illite growth during a faulting event at 158\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8a).\n\n\n\n5.1.5\nNE\u2013SW striking faults\n\n5.1.5.1\nVAH_198\nIn this sample, K-feldspar, biotite, zeolite and smectite are the K-bearing minerals contributing to the K\u2013Ar dates. This sample has an unusual composition since it contains biotite in all fractions, with biotite content increasing towards smaller grain fractions. Biotite Ar cooling ages in the area are typically 400-380\u00a0Ma (Lux, 1985), which suggests that the biotite has to be at least partially reset or authigenic. K-feldspar is assumed to be inherited, as indicated by its fractured and craked appearance in BSE images of the 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm fraction (Fig. 6g). Based on the concave-up age spectrum and unusual mineralogy with uncertain proportions of inheritend and reset or authigenic biotite, the significance of any of the dates from this sample is uncertain (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n5.1.5.2\nVAH_58\nIn this sample, K-feldspar, smectite and potentially plagioclase are the only K-bearing minerals contributing to the K\u2013Ar dates (Fig. 7e). From BSE images we see that the K-feldspar of the coarsest fraction is fractured, indicating an inherited origin. XRD analysis of VAH_58 shows that all fractions except the <0.1\u00a0\u03bcm fractions contain K-feldspar, and we assume these fractions to show mixed dates. The finest fraction (<0.1\u00a0\u03bcm), however, only contains smectite and we interpret the date of this fraction to represent authigenic smectite\/illite growth during faulting at 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n5.1.5.3\nVAH_250_2\nIn this sample, smectite, K-feldspar, potentially plagioclase and zeolite contribute to the K\u2013Ar dates, where the amount of smectite increases and K-feldspar decreases with decreasing grain size (Fig. 7f). Together with BSE images showing K-feldspar replaced by smectite, this indicates that K-feldspar, at least partly, is inherited from the host rock. This indicates that all fractions containing both K-feldspar and smectite represent mixed dates, and even the finest fraction, which still contains ca. 6% K-feldspar, would be older than the main smectite growth event. However, assuming an inherited K-feldspar age of >240\u00a0Ma, and a minor K-contribution from smectite, the age of the authigenic smectite component would need to be unrealistically low to pull down the age of the finest fraction to 129\u00a0Ma. Therefore, we suspect that some of the K-feldspar in the finest fraction might be authigenic or reset, as also interpreted for a gouge sample of the L\u00e6rdal fault by Tartaglia et al. (2020). The presence of zeolite in the gouge indicates that temperatures during faulting could have been up to 250\u00a0\u00b0C, a temperature where K-feldspar can grow (e.g. Mark et al. 2008; Brockamp and Clauer 2013). The date of the finest fraction of 129\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma still needs to be regarded as a maximum age of faulting (Fig. 8b). The age overlaps with the 123\u00a0Ma age of sample VAH_53_3 (Fig. 8a) and with similar ages interpreted from other faults in the study area (Fig. 8c, Fossen et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nPaleostress analysis\nIn an attempt to model the stress field(s) which led to the observed fault and fracture pattern in our study area, we performed paleostress analysis using the software WinTensor by Delvaux and Sperner (2003). To highlight different aspects of our data set, we applied two different approaches to sort and treat the structural data during paleostress analysis: 1) a station approach, and 2) a fault mineralization approach.\n\n5.2.1\nStation approach\nThe station approach is suited to show local variations and the potential effect of inheritance of trends from ductile precursor structures. We assigned our field measurements to 24 stations (Fig. 9\n). The measurements assigned to each station are located within less than 100\u00a0m distance from each other. The stations are colour-coded based on the relationship between brittle fracture and fault measurements and the main ductile foliation at that station (Fig. 9g): 1) if the measured fractures are mainly parallel to the foliation, the station is blue, 2) if the measured fractures mainly cut the foliation, the station is orange, and 3) if fractures are both parallel to and cutting the foliation, the station is red. In addition, grey stereoplot background indicates stations where faults and fractures are dominated by mica mineralizations and strained host rock (Fig. 9b\u2013f). For each station, we conducted individual paleostress analyses (Fig. 9a\u2013f). The resulting paleostress analyses show filled arrows (Fig. 9) for stress tensors derived from seven or more faults and fracture measurements, and for stress tensors with an average misfit angle (alpha) of 5\u00b0 or less. Hollow arrows in Fig. 9 represent stress tensors derived from 5 to 6 fracture and fault measurements and an average misfit angle (alpha) higher than 5\u00b0, and are therefore considered less reliable. Details on these analyses and the mineralizations on fracture surfaces are found in the supplementary material (Supplementary 7).\nA total of 24 local stress tensors with R\u2019 classification were inferred, whereof seven are extensional, seven are transtensional, five are transpressional, four are strike-slip, and one is compressional (Fig. 9). Of the six transpressional and compressional local stress tensors, all except one (station 11) include fractures and faults parallel to the foliation, and five local stress tensors are from stations with mica\/stretched host rock mineralizations indicating the formation of these local stress tensors under relatively high temperatures. Subarea B is dominated by extension (Fig. 9b), subarea F is dominated by transpression (Fig. 9f), whereas the other subareas are not dominated by a spesific stress tensor (Fig. 9a, c-e). From the 22 local stress tensors where the extension direction (\u03c33) is (sub)horizontal (excluding station 17 and 18), 14 have \u03c33 plotting in the NW\u2013SE sector and 7 have \u03c33 plotting more or less E\u2013W, whereas 3 have \u03c33 plotting in the SW\u2013NE sector.\n\n\n5.2.2\nFault mineralization approach\nThe fault mineralization approach is suited to potentially unravel the relative timing of different paleostress fields, by modelling the local stress tensors based on fault and fracture mineralization (Fig. 10\n). In this approach, it is assumed that higher temperature mineralizations such as mica and semi-ductile strained fracture surfaces formed earlier than lower-temperature mineralizations such as zeolite and calcite. This relationship is confirmed by the observation of zeolite and calcite mineralizations having crystallized on top of higher temperature epidote, chlorite and quartz mineralization. Slip lines are often not observed on zeolite and calcite, but rather on epidote, chlorite or quartz. The general absence of slip lines implies that zeolite and calcite mostly crystallized on fractures formed during earlier faulting, and kinematic indicators associated with these faults and fractures are derived from the earlier mineralizations. Therefore, the resulting local stress tensors do not indicate the stress field for the time of calcite formation, but rather indicate what surfaces were reactivated during the time of mineralization. Details on the resulting stress tensors can be found in the supplementary material (Supplementary 7).\nSimilar to the station approach, we chose local stations with sufficient measurements for each of the mineral groups to obtain a local stress tensor. Note that the measurements included within one station are from a slightly larger area (<2\u00a0km, within the same rock types) than for the station approach. Local stations containing high T mineralizations and semi-ductile features, such as SHR, fit into two main local stress tensors: an extensional stress tensor with NW\u2013SE to WNW\u2013ESE extension direction, and a compressional stress tensor with NW\u2013SE compression direction (Fig. 10a). The local stations containing epidote, chlorite and quartz surfaces show three main trends: compressional stress tensor with NW\u2013SE compression direction, transpressional stress tensor with NW-SE compression direction, and strike slip local stress tensors with NW\u2013SE to E\u2013W \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10b). The local stations with zeolite measurements show strike-slip and extensional local stress tensors with WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10c).\n\n\n\n5.3\nCombining paleostress and geochronology\nTo correlate our fault gouge ages with the modelled paleostress regimes, we identified the local stress tensors to which the fault planes for each dated fault were assigned in the two different paleostress approaches (Figs. 9 and 10\n). Note that the sense of slip observed on a fault's plane might not be directly related to the event of faulting which caused the authigenesis of the dated mineral phases. Only two of the dated faults fit into a local stress tensor, namely VAH_250_2 (maximum age of faulting 129\u00a0Ma) and VAH_116_1 (maximum age of faulting 115\u00a0Ma). In the station approach (Fig. 9), VAH_250_2 is represented in station 10, showing transtension with WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction, whereas VAH_116 is included in station 12, showing transtension with E\u2013W \u03c33 direction. For the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10) both VAH_250_2 and VAH_116_1 contain striated zeolite on the fault plane surface. VAH_250_2 is included in a stress tensor showing strike-slip with a WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10c), and VAH_116_1 in a local stress tensor showing extension with WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction (Fig. 10c). Comparing these two approaches, it appears that they nicely match and complement each other. The local stress tensor implies that the local stress regime had a WNW\u2013ESE \u03c33 direction in the Early Cretaceous (129\u2013115\u00a0Ma).\n\n\n\n6\nReconstruction of the post-Caledonian brittle evolution\nOur data set represents the first systematic investigation of brittle fault mineralizations between Sognefjorden and the M\u00f8re Margin (Fig. 1), allowing us to establish relative timing based on formation conditions of the different mineralizations. In the following, we first discuss the relative timing of the lineament and fracture networks, followed by the brittle evolution of the study area from pre-Devonian times to the Cretaceous. Here, we integrate the results from our lineament mapping, fault mineralization mapping, K\u2013Ar dating and paleostress analysis with information from the literature.\n\n6.1\nNature and relative age of fracture networks\nFrom lineament studies and field data of fractures and faults, we detected two major trends in the fracture network striking N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW, and two minor trends striking NW\u2013SE and E\u2013W (Fig. 3b and c). The NE\u2013SW-striking fractures and faults represent a dominating lineament- and fracture set in the study area (Fig. 3b and c) and their strike is in many places parallel or subparallel to the ductile foliation related to the NDSZ, NSZ and MTFC (Figs. 2 and 3). In metamorphic terranes, it is commonly known that brittle structures often develop by geometrically following planar ductile discontinuities in the bedrock (e.g. Butler et al. 2008; Massironi et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2019). We do, however, also observe extensive NE\u2013SW-striking fractures and faults in the Bremanger granodioritic complex (Fig. 3, subarea C). Since the Bremanger granodiorite lacks any ductile deformation features, these faults must have either formed as a continuation of the (inherited) structures outside the granodiorite or they formed according to the given stress field affecting the isotropic granodiorite body. Similarly to the NE\u2013SW fractures and faults discussed above, the E\u2013W trending fractures and faults follow ductile precursors in several subareas (Figs. 2 and 3).\nThe N\u2013S trending fractures and faults in contrast seem to represent a newly formed conjugate set, without any ductile precursor (Figs. 2 and 3). These N\u2013S fractures and faults are dominant in most subareas (Fig. 3b), and N\u2013S striking lineaments are often related to large-scale valleys, particularly in the inner Nordfjord area (Fig. 2, subarea E). These N\u2013S striking lineaments have earlier been shown to be the most dominant lineament feature, both mainland and offshore Norway (e.g. Gabrielsen et al. 2002). The origin of this important fracture and fault trend has been debated. It has been speculated that these features follow long-lived Proterozoic zones of weakness (Gabrielsen et al., 2018). However, most of the N\u2013S features cut the earlier ductile Caledonian foliation, and do not seem to follow any older shear belts. Several of the main N\u2013S striking fault zones (e.g., Votedalen) formed within late Sveconorwegian intrusions (980\u2013930\u00a0Ma; Wang et al., 2021) with only weak ductile Caledonian overprint, supporting a post-Caledonian origin for these N\u2013S trending brittle features.\nOur K\u2013Ar fault gouge geochronology from the N\u2013S trending faults indicates faulting activity during the Jurassic to Cretaceous ca. 158, 123\u2013115 and 86\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8a). Other K\u2013Ar gouge ages from Western Norway indicate that some of these N\u2013S striking faults were also active earlier, in Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian-Triassic times, but mostly during the Jurassic (Fig. 8c, Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Fossen et al., 2021). These studies often relate the N\u2013S structural trend to rift structures formed during E\u2013W extension (e.g. Fossen et al., 2017; Gabrielsen et al., 2018). Offshore, similar observations have been made, where N\u2013S striking extensional structures formed during the rifting in the northern North Sea (e.g. Bartholomew et al. 1993; Dor\u00e9 et al. 1997; Reeve et al. 2015).\nInterestingly, the majority of N\u2013S striking faults and fractures in our data set does not show dip-slip movement as inferred from onshore and offshore interpretations but is rather dominated by strike-slip kinematics (Fig. 2). If these N\u2013S striking fractures and faults originally formed during E\u2013W extension as inferred during earlier studies, the faults must have been reactivated at a later stage creating the strike-slip kinematics. We interpret this as rather unlikely for the following reasons: very few fractures and faults having this orientation show dip-slip kinematics, the strike-slip kinematics are found throughout the region, and the faults and fractures have mostly subvertical dips, which is atypical for dip-slip faults. The N\u2013S fractures and faults are therefore interpreted to have mostly been formed well before the Jurassic rifting episode, possibly as early as the Late Devonian-early Carboniferous (Fig. 11d). In the following, we will attempt to reconstruct the post-Caledonian brittle evolution based on previous work, the fault mineralization approach and the dated K\u2013Ar fault gouges.\n\n\n6.2\nSilurian to Early-Devonian (Caledonian) compression\nThe probably oldest mineralizations are represented by stretched micas and\/or semi-ductile strained host rock minerals, often together with epidote\/chlorite\/quartz, indicating relatively high temperature during formation. From the station approach, five out of six stations with compressional or transpressional local stress tensors contain such surfaces (Fig. 9), indicating that at least some of these structures might have formed during Caledonian compression\/transpression (Fig. 11d). Similar compressional local stress tensors are found in the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10a and b). Compressional stress fields have been recorded from the ca. 460 Ma Rolvsnes granodiorite on B\u00f8mlo further south (Scheiber et al., 2016). There, stretched mica revealed 40Ar\u201339Ar-dates of ca. 450 Ma formed under a NNW\u2013SSE transpressional stress field, whereas faults related to dykes intruding at 435\u00a0Ma formed under WNW\u2013ESE shortening. Caledonian compression was probably ongoing in our region until a switch to syn- and post-collisional extension occurred at around 400\u00a0Ma (Fossen, 2010).\n\n\n6.3\nMiddle to Late Devonian NW\u2013SE extension in an overall transtensional system\nApart from the compressional local stress tensors, high-T mineralizations also fit into ENE\u2013WSW to NW\u2013SE extensional\/transtensional local stress tensors (Figs. 9 and 10a). These features could be early post-Caledonian structures formed in the Middle to Late Devonian, around 400\u2013370\u00a0Ma, when rocks passed through the muscovite closure temperature in the region, as interpreted by Walsh et al. (2013). NW\u2013SE extension and brittle faulting in Early to Middle Devonian has been described from the Bergen area (Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Larsen et al., 2003) and further south (Scheiber and Viola, 2018). The NW\u2013SE extensional stress field is in accordance with early post-Caledonian penetrative ductile extension which was generally oriented towards the NW (mode I back-sliding, Fossen, 1992, 2010). The penetrative ductile extension was followed by a more localized (mode II) extension focused on large-scale shear zones, equally with top-NW shear sense in the south (Hardangerfjord shear zone, Jotun Detachment, Fossen, 1992; 2010). However, in our study area, the ductile extension direction is oriented towards the W along the NSD and top-to-the-WSW along the sinistral MTFZ (Fossen, 1992, 2010; Seranne, 1992; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001), interpreted to be the result of a large-scale transtensional system in the Middle to Late Devonian (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998). In such a transtensional system, our derived NW\u2013SE extensional stress field could be explained as representing the orthogonal stretching direction in a strain-partitioned system, with the strike-slip component taken up along strands of the MTFZ (Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998).\n\n\n6.4\nLate Devonian to early Carboniferous strike-slip\nFractures and faults coated with epidote, chlorite, and quartz are the most common in the region (Fig. 4). These minerals form under a wide range of temperatures of ca. 400\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g. Bird and Spieler 2004; Inoue et al. 2009). Given the relatively slow cooling of the entire region (Dunlap and Fossen, 1998; Ksienzyk et al., 2014; Scheiber et al., 2016), the area stayed at temperatures of ca. 400\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C from the Devonian until at least the beginning of the Mesozoic, and fractures and faults containing these mineralizations could therefore have formed and\/or could have been reactivated during a long time span. In Western Norway, faults containing similar mineralizations have been interpreted to have formed and been reactivated from the Late Devonian-early Carboniferous to the Permian, with possible Mesozoic reactivation (e.g. Braathen, 1999; Larsen et al., 2003; Walsh et al., 2013).\nThe most prominent local stress tensors obtained from the fault mineralization approach represent strike-slip regimes (R'\u00a0=\u00a01.43\u20131.75) with a E\u2013W to NW\u2013SE \u03c33 direction and a N\u2013S to NE\u2013SW \u03c31 direction (Fig. 10b). Based on paleocurrent and structural analysis of the Devonian Kvamshesten basin, Osmundsen et al. (1998) proposed a model where NW\u2013SE extension and perpendicular NE\u2013SW shortening was overprinted by younger W\u2013E extension and perpendicular N\u2013S shortening from the Middle Devonian to the early Carboniferous, indicating two independent stress fields through time, with the \u03c33 direction rotating anticlockwise from NW to W through time. Alternatively, Osmundsen and Andersen (2001) proposed a model where the change in orientation of the extension and shortening directions mainly depends on the distance from the MTFZ, similar to the strain-partitioned transtensional model proposed by Krabbendam and Dewey (1998). From the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10b), we see that the \u03c33 orientation turns into an E\u2013W trend when approaching the MTFC, whereas the stations towards Sognefjorden in the south show a tendency to a NW\u2013SE trending \u03c33. The same trends are partially reflected in the station approach (Fig. 9), which indicates a changing stressfield depending on the distance from the MTFC in Late Devonian and early Carboniferous, as proposed by Osmundsen and Andersen (2001) (Fig. 11d).\n\n\n6.5\nPermian E\u2013W extension (rift phase 1)\nA few E\u2013W pure extensional local stress tensors are present in the station approach. These local stress tensors are dominated by fractures striking N\u2013S and NE\u2013SW showing normal dip-slip to oblique-slip kinematics. Similar approximately E\u2013W to ENE\u2013WSW extensional stress fields are well known from SW Norway and along the M\u00f8re margin, and have earlier been interpreted to first initiate in the Permian and Early Triassic during rift phase 1 (e.g. Torsvik et al., 1997; Fossen and Dunlap, 1998; Walsh et al., 2013; Fossen et al., 2017; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017; Scheiber and Viola, 2018). The W-plunging Dalsfjord fault (Eide et al., 1994) shows Permian ages from palaeomagnetic and 40Ar\u201339Ar dating, and K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages from Western Norway show a peak of activity in the early to mid Permian (Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber et al., 2019; Fossen et al., 2021) (Figs. 8c and 12a). Interestingly, this elsewhere important phase does not seem to be very prominent in our data set. Only few measurements fit into such purely extensional E\u2013W stress fields in the station approach, none in the fault mineralization approach (Figs. 9 and 10), and none of our K\u2013Ar gouge dates are present from this time span (Fig. 8).\n\n\n6.6\nLate Jurassic to Late Cretaceous WNW\u2013ESE transtension\nAll our four monomineralic K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages, the tentative faulting age of 123\u00a0Ma and the two maximum ages of faulting fall into the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous (Figs. 8 and 11). Five of the six ages post-date the well-known Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rift phase 2 (Fig. 11a; Gabrielsen et al., 1999; Viola et al., 2016; Fossen et al., 2017). Rift phase 2 probably represents crustal stretching, but the orientation of the stress field during this phase is debated, from NW\u2013SE or E\u2013W extension (e.g. Bartholomew et al., 1993; F\u00e6rseth, 1996; F\u00e6rseth et al., 1997; Reeve et al., 2015), or rotation from E\u2013W extension to NW\u2013SE extension to NE\u2013SW extension (e.g. Dor\u00e9 et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2001). Our oldest sample VAH_267_2 (158\u00a0Ma), associated with zeolite mineralization, does not fit into any of the local stress tensors from the fault mineralization approach (Fig. 10). However, the clear strike-slip kinematics of the fault (subhorizontal slip lines) indicates that this fault is not a typical dip-slip rift-related structure.\nThe five younger ages overlap with what seems to be two regional faulting events when combined with K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages documented onshore by others at around 130\u2013110\u00a0Ma (Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020; Fossen et al., 2021) and 90\u201370\u00a0Ma (Scheiber et al., 2019; Tartaglia et al., 2020; Fossen et al., 2021) (Fig. 11a). These Cretaceous faulting events have been interpreted as a response to hyperextension along the Mid-Norwegian margin, resulting in cooling and exhumation of the onshore area (Fossen et al., 2017; Ksienzyk et al., 2016; Viola et al., 2016; Scheiber and Viola, 2018; Tartaglia et al., 2020) and coincide with two periods of suggested tectonic activity in the Norwegian Sea (F\u00e6rseth and Trond, 2002; Theissen-Krah et al., 2017). Two of the dated gouges, VAH_250_2 and VAH_116_1, show kinematics with a E\u2013W to WNW\u2013ESE trending \u03c33 and extensional to strike-slip stress tensors. The kinematics and resulting stress tensor could be partly inherited from the previous strike-slip stress tensor derived from epidote-chlorite-quartz mineralizations, but since some of the dated faults also contain striated zeolite and calcite, we interpret the derived local stress tensor to represent the prevailing stress condition during the Cretaceous (Fig. 11d).\nThe VAH_267_2 (158\u00a0Ma) and VAH_116_1 (115\u00a0Ma) faults contain synkinematic zeolites, indicating that the widespread low-T zeolite mineralizations could be primarily of Late Jurassic to Cretaceous age. Similarly, the VAH_53_3 fault (123 and 86\u00a0Ma) contains striated calcite, supporting the field observation that calcite mineralizations generally are younger than the zeolite mineralizations, possibly being of mainly Cretaceous age, in accordance with the interpretation of Watts (2001).\n\n\n\n7\nSummary and conclusions\nOur interpretation of brittle fault mineralizations, K\u2013Ar fault gouge data and paleostress analyses reveal the following brittle evolution for the area between Sognefjorden and the M\u00f8re Margin (Fig. 12e):\n\n(1)\nHigh-T fault surface minerals indicate NW\u2013SE compression in the Late Silurian to Early Devonian, followed by NW\u2013SE extension under semi-ductile conditions.\n\n\n(2)\nEpidote-, chlorite- and quartz-bearing fractures and faults are interpreted to have initiated mainly in the Middle Devonian to early Carboniferous, representing two distinct paleostress fields: (1) NW\u2013SE compression and, (2) strike-slip stress regimes with a changing \u03c33 direction from NW\u2013SE in the southern part of the region to E\u2013W in the northern part of the region. The changing stress tensor is interpreted to be due to increasing strain partitioning closer to the MTFC.\n\n\n(3)\nOnly a limited number of epidote-, chlorite- and quartz-bearing fractures and faults fit into purely E\u2013W extensional local stress regimes, and these could probably be related to rift phase 1 in the Permian to Early Triassic in the North Sea, though this phase seems not to be very prominent in our study area.\n\n\n(4)\nAll four K\u2013Ar fault gouge ages and the two maximum ages of faulting fall into the Late Jurassic to Cretaceous, with only one age overlapping with the well-known Late Jurassic offshore rift phase 2. The other five ages constrain two younger extensive faulting events under a WNW\u2013ESE transtensional stress regime with related fluid flow and precipitation of zeolite and calcite in Middle (123\u2013115\u00a0Ma) and Late (86\u201377\u00a0Ma) Cretaceous times. These two faulting events can be related to periods of increased tectonic activity in the Norwegian Sea.\n\n\n\nOur results show that the brittle architecture of the northern section of the passive margin of Western Norway is controlled by two dominant brittle precursor directions (NE\u2013SW and E\u2013W striking shear zones) as well as two newly formed, mainly strike-slip fault sets with conjugate orientations to the brittle precursors (N\u2013S and NW\u2013SE striking). The interpreted Late Devonian to early Carboniferous age of the N\u2013S trending lineaments is different from previous models where the important N\u2013S lineament population in Western Norway was interpreted to have mainly originated during Permo-Triassic or Jurassic E\u2013W rifting. The domination of strike-slip fault sets is different from the mainly dip-slip controlled brittle architecture of the southern section of the passive margin south of Sognefjorden, indicating a more prominent transtensional\/strike-slip regime from the Late Devonian onwards at the transition to the M\u00f8re margin. Our multi-method approach shows that detailed fault mineralization mapping is crucial for unravelling both kinematics and relative timing of brittle faulting, giving, combined with paleostress analysis, a more complete picture of the brittle evolution of the area than K\u2013Ar fault gouge geochronology alone.\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\n\u00c5se Hestnes: Conceptualization, Writing - Original Draft, Visualization, Formal analysis, Investigation.

Deformation is often associated with extrusion of continental fragments, observed in situations like India-Eurasia collision and SE Asia extrusion (Fig. 1\na; e.g., Molnar and Tapponier, 1975; Morley, 2002, 2013; Searle et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2001; Tapponnier et al., 1986), Arabia-Anatolia system (Fig. 1b; e.g., Kaymakci et al., 2010; Lyberis et al., 1992; Mantovani et al., 2006; Martinod et al., 2000; Perin\u00e7ek and \u00c7emen, 1990; Smit et al., 2010) or Adria-Europe convergence (Fig. 1c; e.g., Frisch et al., 1998; Neubauer et al., 2000; Ratschbacher et al., 1991b; Rosenberg et al., 2004; van Gelder et al., 2020; van Unen et al., 2019; W\u00f6lfler et al., 2011). In all these situations, indentation-induced deformation is affected by extension driven by the slab roll-back of another subduction zone (Fig. 1, see also Regard et al., 2005; Schellart et al., 2019; Sternai et al., 2016). This extension has a variable orientation (from parallel to perpendicular) with respect to the frontal shortening or the lateral strike-slip deformation taking place during indentation. The resulting multi-scale distribution of the bulk strain by connecting different kinematic types of deformation that cannot be explained by a uniform stress field is generally referred to as strain partitioning (e.g., Benesh et al., 2014; Cembrano et al., 2005; D\u2019el-Rey Silva et al., 2011; De Vicente et al., 2009; Glen, 2004; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013). Although it is known that slab-roll back can affect the large-scale deformation associated with indentation (e.g., Faccenna et al., 1996; Schellart et al., 2019), the mechanism of strain partitioning and deformation transfer between slab roll-back induced extension and indentation is not well understood. Previous research into indentation systems has demonstrated that the indenter geometry dominantly controls the strain partitioning and deformation transfer (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2021), which should be accounted for when studying the impact of the extension driven by slab roll-back.\nWe aim to understand the interplay of extension driven by slab roll-back and indentation-driven deformation, together with a quantification of the associated strain partitioning and fault kinematics. To this aim, we performed crustal-scale analogue modelling experiments designed to test the influence of the extension direction during indentation in terms of kinematics, distribution of deformation and the coeval formation and evolution of sedimentary basins. Image correlation methods were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse deformation patterns around the indenter. The analogue experiments were scaled and applied to the indentation of the Moesian Platform during the formation of the arcuate back-arc convex Carpatho-Balkanides orocline that was coeval with the back-arc extension driven by the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs (Fig. 2\n).\n\n\n2\nThe Circum-Moesian Fault System of the Carpatho-Balkanides\nThe Carpatho-Balkanides orogenic system of South-Eastern Europe (Fig. 2a) is a Cretaceous thick-skinned nappe stack whose formation was associated with the closure of the Ceahl\u0103u-Severin branch of the Alpine Tethys Ocean leading to the collision between the Dacia mega-unit and the Moesian Platform, a promontory of the stable pre-Alpine European continent (Fig. 2a and b; S\u0103ndulescu, 1988; Csontos and V\u00f6r\u00f6s, 2004; Schmid et al., 2008, 2020). Subsequent Cenozoic subduction, slab retreat and closure of the Carpathian embayment created the oroclinal bending and the present-day double 180\u00b0 curved geometry of the entire orogenic system (Fig. 2a; e.g., Csontos and V\u00f6r\u00f6s, 2004; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005; Ustaszewski et al., 2008).\nThe southern part of the double 180\u00b0 orocline consists of the South Carpathians, the Serbian Carpathians and the Balkanides and has a backarc-convex geometry (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020) formed by oroclinal bending and dextral transcurrent motions of the Dacia mega-unit around the Moesian Platform (Fig. 2b; van Hinsbergen et al., 2020). This oroclinal bending was first accommodated by Paleocene \u2013 Eocene orogen-parallel extension in the South Carpathians (Matenco and Schmid, 1999; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, 2005; Schmid et al., 1998), followed by Oligocene-middle Miocene deformation along the Circum-Moesian Fault System (thick black lines in Fig. 2b), one of the largest European intracontinental strike-slip fault systems, accumulating up to 140\u00a0km of dextral offset, associated with coeval thrusting and normal faulting (e.g., Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2022). These faults have different orientations, connect and transfer the deformation along the entire orocline, from the South Carpathians in the north to the Balkanides in the south. The largest faults in the system are the Cerna and Timok curved strike-slip faults that have 35\u00a0km and 65\u00a0km of dextral offset, respectively, and connect with thrusting-dominated deformation in the frontal part of the South Carpathians and Balkan Mountains (Fig. 2b; see also Berza and Dr\u0103ganescu, 1988; Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2002).\nThe evolution of the Circum-Moesian Fault System was (partly) coeval with widespread extensional processes related to the roll back of the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs (Bennett et al., 2008; Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012; Horv\u00e1th et al., 2015, Andri\u0107 et al., 2018) where the latter probably controlled E-W extension in the Morava Valley Corridor, the southern prolongation of the Pannonian Basin, and affected the western margin of the Serbian Carpathians segment of the orocline, from Oligocene to middle Miocene times (Figs. 1c and 2a; Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012; Erak et al., 2017; Sant et al., 2018; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020). Additionally, the oroclinal bending was complicated by one other extensional\/transtensional deformation that affected the Serbian and South Carpathians during their movement around the Moesian indenter and the formation of the Circum-Moesian Fault System, driven by the Carpathian embayment slab roll-back kinematics (Figs. 1c and 2). In the prolongation of the Timok Fault (Fig. 2b), a late Oligocene \u2013 early Miocene period of transtension and extension led to the opening of the Getic Depression in the South Carpathians foreland, which was subsequently inverted and buried during the middle to late Miocene docking of the South Carpathians against the Moesian indenter (e.g., Matenco et al., 2003; R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013). This extension also created a number of presently E-W oriented intra-montane basins in the Serbian Carpathians (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020, 2022). These complex movements around the Moesian indenter are inferred to be driven by rotational kinematics of the retreating Carpathian embayment slab and the formation of a STEP (subduction-transform edge propagator) system at high depths beneath the South Carpathians (Fig. 2a; Govers and Wortel, 2005; Ma\u0163enco, 2017).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nStarting from a published analogue modelling setup with a fixed indenter, around which a deformable material is translating and rotating (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2021), we have performed crustal scale analogue experiments to simulate deformation in the upper to middle crust around a rigid indenter under the influence of variable extension direction. We note that the unusual high complexity of strain partitioning requires a correlation with this previously published study. Our experiments are designed (Fig. 3\n) to simulate the impact of the variability in kinematic boundary conditions and provide the possibility of a direct analysis of deformation styles. Four different kinematic setups were chosen to compare the deformation transfer and strain partitioning for cases with and without an externally-driven extension affecting the indentation process. The applied extension was either N\u2013S (model 2), E-W (model 3) or coevally in both directions (model 3), consistent with the observed extension directions that affect the Carpatho-Balkanides orocline in its South Carpathians and Serbian Carpathians segments (e.g., R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2022). Below we describe the modelling setup and results in a relative geographic framework where north is oriented upwards in top-view figures (e.g., Fig. 3), in analogy to the geographic framework of the Circum-Moesian Fault System (Fig. 2).\n\n3.1\nModelling setup\n\n3.1.1\nModel geometry and kinematics\nThe indenter is made of a 2\u00a0cm thick rigid polyvinyl chloride plate with rounded corners (Figs. 3a) and 35\u00b0 margin inclination (Fig. 3c), approximating the geometry of the base of the Cretaceous nappe-stack thrust over the Moesian Platform (Fig. 2b; Ma\u0163enco, 2017 and references therein). The indenter upper width of 26\u00a0cm (Fig. 3a) correlates with the N\u2013S dimension of the Moesian Platform (Fig. 2).\nSimilar to Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021), the base of the deformable part of models is made of a mobile basal plastic plate and a fixed plastic sheet (Fig. 3). The 1\u00a0mm thick plastic plate (green in Fig. 3) underlies the entire model, including the rigid block. Through a bar and mechanical joints it is connected to a motor (Fig. 3a) that pulls it northward at a constant velocity of 2\u00a0cm\/h. The other, fixed 0.1\u00a0mm thick plastic sheet (grey in Fig. 3) is placed on top of the moving plate north of the indenter, while it is below the moving plate to the north-west. This change is implemented at the N\u2013S oriented cut in the middle of the moving plate (dashed green line in Fig. 3a). The purpose of this configuration is to prevent an E-W oriented velocity discontinuity along the northern margin of the indenter. This setup pre-defines velocity discontinuities (VD) in all models along the southern and western margins, as well as along the south-western corner of the indenter and along the cut in the moving plastic plate in the north (Fig. 3a).\nThe mobile plastic plate moves north-wards in all models and its movement is controlled by the fixed guide bar in the north (Fig. 3a), which results in a coupled translational and rotational movement (Fig. 3b). The rotational component of motion is controlled by a stationary pin protruding from below the indenter (fixed pin in Fig. 3a), creating a pole of rotation. The cut in the moving plastic plate enables its sliding and rotation around the stationary pin. The coupled translation and rotation takes place during the entire period of each experiment, resulting in the total northward displacement of the mobile plate of 9\u00a0cm and 10\u00b0 of clockwise rotation (Fig. 3b).\nThe difference between our models is the change in kinematic boundary conditions applied to the northern and western margins of the model, simulating different effects of extensional directions on the deformation transfer around the indenter. In model 1 (Fig. 3e) all model boundaries are confined, either by metal bars or sand, to prevent the silicone putty (see material properties below) flowing and creating extension. The effect of extension is simulated in models 2, 3 and 4 by (partially) opening lateral boundaries in the northern, north-eastern and western parts of the models, which allows for extension of the model by gravity driven flow of the viscous, silicone putty layer in direction perpendicular to the open boundary. For loading conditions applied in this study, the gravity driven average velocity of the flow is \u223c9.6\u00a0mm\/h (see also section 3.2). Model 2 (Fig. 3f) has open northern and north-eastern boundaries, which facilitates the flow of the viscous layer away from the indenter (i.e., to the north and north-east). Model 3 (Fig. 3g) has a partially open western boundary and allows the silicone putty to flow to the west until it reaches a confining bar, which is at a larger distance in the north compared to the south (Fig. 3g) introducing a displacement gradient which simulates the limited extension of the south-ward narrowing Morava Valley Corridor. In model 4 (Fig. 3h) the northern boundary is fully open (as in model 2) and the western boundary is open partially (as in model 3).\n\n\n3.1.2\nModel materials\nAll four models consist of brittle and viscous layers with the same rheological properties (Fig. 3a\u2013d). The 1.5\u00a0cm thick brittle layer is made of dry feldspar sand with a bulk density of \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a01300\u00a0kg\/m3, a cohesion of 10\u201350\u00a0Pa and coefficients of friction of 0.68, 0.55 and 0.61, representing peak, dynamic and reactivation friction, respectively (Willingshofer et al., 2005, 2018). The sand has been sieved to the grain size of 100\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcm. Thin marker horizons of black feldspar sand mark vertical offsets along faults in cross-sections. Horizontal offsets are shown by passive maker lines of black and pink feldspar sand placed on the model's top surface. In Fig. 3a, the outline of the sand layer in the model is shown with a blue line and where it is in contact with the indenter it coincides with the upper edge of the inclined indenter margin (Fig. 3a, c).\nUnderlying the feldspar sand, the 0.5\u00a0cm thick viscous layer (pink dashed outline in Fig. 3a, see also Fig. 3c) is analogous to the ductile crust below the brittle-ductile transition. It is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS silicone polymer) putty that has a Newtonian behaviour for strain rates below 10\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 (Rudolf et al., 2016), with a density of \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0970\u00a0kg\/m3, no yield strength and an average viscosity of 2.8 104\u00a0Pa\u00a0s at room temperature (\u223c20\u00a0\u00b0C; Rudolf et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n3.2\nScaling\nWe scaled our models to nature according to principles of geometrical, rheological and kinematical similarities (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1981; Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986; Davy and Cobbold, 1991). When scaling lengths, we follow the previous analogue modelling study applied to the same natural case of the Carpatho-Balkanides by Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021). This means that 1\u00a0cm in our models corresponds to 7\u00a0km in nature, which yields a length-scale ratio L*\u00a0=\u00a01.43\u221910\u22126. With this length-scale ratio, 1.5\u00a0cm depth of the brittle-viscous transition in our models corresponds to \u223c10\u00a0km depth in nature, which is supported by the shallow seismicity and the crustal structure reported in the South and Serbian Carpathians (e.g., Dimitrijevic, 1994; Popa et al., 2018). Lithostatic stress at this depth in the experiments is 191\u00a0Pa, which corresponds to 280\u00a0MPa in nature, resulting in a stress-scale ratio of 6.82\u221910\u22127. Such stress conditions at the base of the brittle layer lead to a threefold increase of flow velocity of silicone as determined by separate gravity driven flow test, performed under loaded (1.5\u00a0cm feldspar sand on top of the silicone layer) and not loaded conditions. Following Brun (2002) strength profiles (Fig. 3d) have been calculated, which are representative for the initial model conditions. Externally imposed velocity, controlled by the engine, was used to calculate strength profiles for the strike-slip and compression regimes, whereas we used flow velocity of silicone putty under loaded conditions to calculate the strength of the viscous layer under gravity driven extension. Based on the flow properties of the viscous layer, we scaled velocity in our models for the strike-slip deformation, following Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021), by calculating a time-scale ratio (Hubbert, 1937) t*\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u221910\u221211, which yields a velocity ratio V*\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u2219104. It follows that a velocity of 2\u00a0cm\/h in our models scales to 0.65\u00a0cm\/yr in nature. This corresponds well with the 60\u201365\u00a0km displacement along the Timok Fault during \u223c10 Myr (Kr\u00e4utner and Krsti\u0107, 2003; Schmid et al., 2020). Though the velocity scaling is tied to the strike-slip deformation, we note that the displacement rates along normal faults in the Getic Depression (0.4\u20130.6\u00a0mm\/y during the period of activity of the Timok Fault, estimated from normal fault offsets reported in Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013 and references therein) are significantly lower compared to the strike-slip faults (e.g., Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013). This correlates well with gravity driven and engine driven flow velocities in our models, although the difference between the two velocities in our models is lower than those in nature.\n\n\n3.3\nExperimental procedures, monitoring and analysis approach\nAll models are built and run in a normal gravity field and at room temperature (\u223c20\u00a0\u00b0C). During the experiment, extensional deformation creates depressions in models. In order to track deformation in these depressions (i.e., basins), when they become \u223c1\u00a0mm deep, we fill them with alternating layers of differently coloured sand using a funnel. This sand represents, in a simplified way, syn-kinematic sedimentation. To preserve topography at the end of each experiment, two post-kinematic layers of black and white sand are sieved on top to cover the entire model. Subsequently, water is sprinkled on the sand layers to increase cohesion in the sand allowing for sectioning of the experiments in order to obtain information on the geometry of deformation structures.\nTop-view photographs perpendicular to the model surface are taken at regular time intervals of 3\u00a0min, which corresponds to 0.1\u00a0cm of motor-induced northward displacement between two photographs. We use particle image velocimetry on these top-view photographs (PIVlab, Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014) to calculate incremental particle displacements for each pair of adjacent photographs in the time series. The obtained incremental displacement fields are inspected for the presence of very large displacements that represent data outliers. Such outliers form due to incorrect correlations and are removed by applying a magnitude threshold filter, followed by visual inspection and manual removal. Displacements in basins for time frames when syn-kinematic sedimentation is added cannot be correlated automatically. Therefore, for these few time frames in each model, displacements in basin areas are interpolated from basin margins. Displacement fields are further analysed using the methodology and Strain Map software of Broerse et al. (2021) and Broerse (2021) to calculate 2D average strain type at the surface during evolution of our models. In the end, we combine our 2D strain analysis with visual interpretation of top-view photographs and vertical-cross sections to infer 3D deformation in our models.\n\n\n3.4\nModelling limitations and simplifications\nThe laboratory time-scale of our experiments is 5\u00a0h during which deformation is induced by horizontal motion of a mobile plate as described in section 3.1.1. This relatively fast deformation allows for adopting an inverse density gradient of the model layers without influencing the modelling outcome. This simplification is justified because buoyancy driven vertical motions typically occur on laboratory time-scales of days (e.g., Cobbold and Szatmari, 1991; Brun and Fort 2004, 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007; Warsitzka et al., 2015). Additionally, salt tectonic experiments have shown that syn-kinematic sedimentation significantly reduces diapirism even on longer time-scales (e.g., Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007; Brun and Fort 2011). We, therefore, consider that the buoyancy effect is negligible in our models and that no diapirism contributed to the overall deformation.\nFurthermore, our models do not account for isostasy, surface erosion and sediment transport, creating exaggerated topography in the contractional area in front of the indenter. However, this area is not the main target of our study as we focus more on the interaction between strike-slip and extension behind the indenter and along its lateral margin. As our models do not account for vertical temperature gradients, the viscosity of the silicone putty simulating viscous behaviour is constant with depth, which is considered acceptable in analogue modelling studies (e.g., Davy and Cobbold, 1991). All other simplifications follow Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nThe modelling results are presented as top-view photographs and average strain maps (Fig. 4\n \u2013 7) for key moments in the evolution of all 4 models (i.e., after 1\u00a0cm, 4\u00a0cm and 9\u00a0cm of northward displacement) and interpreted cross-sections (Figs. 4\u20137) portraying the final deep structure of each experiment. Furthermore, time-lapse map-view videos of each model (see Supplementary material) were used to derive kinematics and temporal and spatial evolution of fault pattern during deformation.\n\n4.1\nModel 1: reference model with closed boundaries\nIn this experiment, all sides are confined by metal bars or sand and the model shows a gradual transition from dextral strike-slip dominated deformation along the western indenter's margin through transpression around the indenter's SW corner to shortening-dominated deformation along the southern margin (Fig. 4). The evolution of this deformation transfer and fault pattern is gradual and increases its complexity through time.\nEarly in the deformation history, lateral movement along the western indenter margin is accommodated by en-\u00e9chelon NNE-SSW oriented Riedel shears (R in Fig. 4a, b) and a N\u2013S oriented strike-slip fault, which develops above the lower edge of the indenter's margin (1 in Fig. 4a and b). At the same time shortening south of the indenter is accommodated along the top-N basal thrust (Fig. 4a and b), which has no clear connection to the strike-slip faults.\nAfter approximately 4\u00a0cm of total northward translation (Fig. 4c and d), strike-slip fault segments connect to form a through-going N\u2013S oriented fault system (1 in Fig. 4c and d). North of the pole of rotation, this strike-slip system partitions deformation in a positive flower structure with shortening to transpression being accommodated along the margins of the system (red and orange in Fig. 4d) and strike-slip to transtension (green and light blue in Fig. 4d) in the centre of the deformation zone. Remnants of Riedel shears form NNE oriented curved splays within the strike-slip system (Fig. 4c and d). The strike-slip system transfers part of its offset south-east-wards to a basal thrust via transpressional NW-SE oriented faults (2 in Fig. 4c and d), during its gradual south-wards propagation (3 in Fig. 4c and d). Shortening in front of the indenter is also accommodated by a new back-thrust (Fig. 4c and d) and weak, distributed shortening farther to the south (pale red in Fig. 4d). In the area between the basal thrust and the back-thrust, minor extensional deformation (blue in Fig. 4d) accommodates the change from ramp to upper-flat surface of the indenter.\nThe first order style and kinematics of deformation remain similar until the end of experiment (i.e., after 9\u00a0cm of total northward translation; Fig. 4e and f), especially in the north, where the positive flower structure and north-east-ward splay remain with a similar geometry and strain pattern (Fig. 4e and f and cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 4g). To the south, the connection between the main strike-slip fault (1 in Fig. 4e and f) and the basal thrust remains active and linked up with the NW-SE transpressional fault (2 in Fig. 4e and f). A new complex strike-slip fault (4 in Fig. 4e and f and cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 4g) with numerous low-offset splays propagates south-wards from the main strike-slip system and deforms the previously formed thrust wedge. South of the indenter, weak extensional deformation with numerous low-offset normal faults partially reactivates the back-thrust, while the bulk shortening is accommodated along the basal thrust (Fig. 4e and f, and cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 4g).\n\n\n4.2\nModel 2: open northern boundary\nThe open northern boundary in model 2 creates extension, which results in the opening of a large fault-controlled extensional basin north of the indenter (highlighted semi-transparent white area in Fig. 5\na, c, e). This basin reflects the interplay between extension and strike-slip deformation because the entire fault system north of the indenter connects towards SW to the N\u2013S oriented dextral strike-slip deformation. This strike-slip system further transfers deformation to thrusting on top of the southern indenter's margin. The latter feature has the same evolution, geometry and kinematics as in the model 1 for the entire experiment duration (Fig. 5).\nThe early strike-slip deformation along the western indenter's margin is accommodated by NNE-SSW oriented Riedel shears (R in Fig. 5a and b) and early N\u2013S oriented strike-slip faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 5a and b). To the south, fault 2 connects to the basal thrust, while to the north, Riedel shears connect to numerous normal faults that accommodate extensional deformation (3\u20137 in Fig. 5a and b). These normal faults dip either to the north or south creating small and isolated basins (e.g., between faults 6 and 7 and 4 and 5 in Fig. 5a) separated by ridges (such as between faults 4 and 7 in Fig. 5a, cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 5g). Closer to the indenter, these normal faults have curved geometries (3, 6 and 7 in Fig. 5a), controlled by the NW indenter corner, as they gradually transfer extension through transtension to strike-slip deformation (Fig. 5b).\nAfter 4\u00a0cm of northward translation, the strike-slip system is fully connected into a continuous multi-strand structure (10 and 11 in Fig. 5c and d). In the north, the small, early basins connect into a single larger basin with intra-basinal highs and sub-basins, while new faults (e.g., 8 and 9 in Fig. 5c and d) form to connect normal faults with the strike-slip system along the western indenter's margin.\nTowards the end of the experiment, the basin system in the north further enlarges with new smaller normal faults forming within its interior (e.g., 12 in Fig. 5e and f, cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 5g). The overall strain pattern north of the indenter shows intercalating regions of extension-dominated and strike-slip to transtension-dominated deformation. The latter are more frequent around the NW indenter corner where the basin is narrower and extension connects with strike-slip system (Fig. 5f, cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 5g). Along the western indenter's margin, fault 2 propagates to connect with the main strike-slip system along an oblique thrust (13, Fig. 5e and f, cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 5g). To the south, the main strike-slip system (10 in Fig. 5e and f) completely inverts the narrow southern tip of the basin (cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 5g), creating a positive topography (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 5g) during its south-ward propagation (14 in Fig. 5e and f).\n\n\n4.3\nModel 3: partially open western boundary\nThe\u00a0\u223c\u00a0E-W extension induced along the western model margin creates a distinctively different fault pattern along the western indenter margin compared to the previous two models (Fig. 6\n), where strain is partitioned into two sub-parallel\u00a0\u223c\u00a0N\u2013S oriented zones of combined dextral strike-slip, transtension and extension. To the south, strike-slip deformation is transferred to thrusting on top of the southern indenter's margin, which creates the same deformation pattern as in the previous two models.\nThe early-stage deformation is localized in two closely spaced, sub-parallel dextral strike-slip faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 6a and b), also associated with a weak extensional strain (blue in Fig. 6b). North-wards, these two faults splay to form NE striking faults around the indenter's NW corner (Fig. 6a and b).\nThe evolution of both strike-slip and E-W oriented extension leads to formation of two separate deformation zones, which connect where strike-slip deformation is gradually replaced by transpressive deformation at the southwestern indenter corner (Fig. 6c and d). The eastern of the two forms on top of the velocity discontinuity and is controlled by faults 1 and 2 (Fig. 6c and d), while the western deformation zone is slightly younger and is controlled by faults 3 and 4 (Fig. 6c and d). In both zones, subsidence in narrow basins (Fig. 6c) is controlled by dominant dip-slip faults, while strike-slip deformation affects central areas of the basins (Fig. 6d).\nWith progressing deformation, new faults with dominant strike-slip kinematics form within the two deformation zones (e.g., faults 5 and 6 in Fig. 6e and f). The gradual cessation of extension along the western model margin leads to basins inversion, mostly along the eastern shear zone. This is, for instance, observed in cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 (Fig. 6g) where positive topography in the basin area (between faults 1 and 2), the offset at the base of the basin and deformed sedimentary infill indicate inversion of originally transtensive faults (1 and 2) and new strike-slip faulting (5). Strike-slip deformation becomes subsequently the dominant deformation along the western indenter's margin, where it propagates south-wards and overprints the earlier thrust wedge (e.g., fault 7 in Fig. 6e and f and cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 6g). The thrust wedge (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 6g) displays the same structural pattern as in models 1 and 2 (cross section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 4g and cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 5g) where most of thrusting is accommodated along the basal thrust, while a single back-thrust is reactivated by low-offset normal faulting.\n\n\n4.4\nModel 4: open northern and partially open western boundaries\nThe coevally evolving extensions along the northern and western model margins create a large extensional basin north of the indenter, which shows a combination of features observed in models 2 and 3. Extension is gradually transferred to dextral strike-slip and transtension that affects a wide area along the western margin of the indenter. South-wards, the strike-slip deformation is transferred to shortening like in all previous models (Fig. 7\n).\nEarly in the model evolution, the deformation along the western indenter's margin is accommodated by two N\u2013S oriented dextral transtensional faults (1 and 2 in Fig. 7a and b), which control a narrow basin in between. Distributed subsidence affects a wider area west of these two faults (blue in Fig. 7b), with no evident normal faulting at the resolution of the model. North-wards, strike-slip to transtensional faults curve around the NW indenter's corner to connect to transtensional to normal faults north of the indenter (3\u20138 in Fig. 7a and b). These normal faults dip north-wards or south-wards, creating several isolated basins (Fig. 7a, see also cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g).\nAfter \u223c4\u00a0cm of north-ward translation, the isolated basins and intervening highs are connected into one large basin (Fig. 7c and d, see also cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 7g). This basin enlargement and connection with strike-slip deformation takes place along previously and newly formed normal and strike-slip faults (8\u201312 in Fig. 7c and d). West of the indenter, new normal faults accommodate the extensional component of deformation which further contributes to basin enlargement (13 in Fig. 7c and d).\nTowards the end of the experiment, the basin system expands, especially to the west of the main strike-slip zone where new faults (14 and 15 in Fig. 7e and f) accommodate subsidence at the transition from extension in the north to strike-slip and the extension in the west. North of the indenter, the structure of the basin is characterized by sub-basins separated by intra-basinal highs (cross-section a-a\u2019 in Fig. 7g). In the area around the NW corner of the indenter where the two extension directions interfere, the structural pattern is more complex (Fig. 7e and cross-section b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g). In this area, strain is partitioned into extension-dominated and strike-slip-dominated regions (areas of blue and green in Fig. 7f). A distinct feature is a narrow zone of shortening to transpressional deformation located in the hanging wall of fault 3, which can be inferred from the strain analysis (Fig. 7f), but cannot be seen in cross-sections (i.e., no reverse displacement in cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g). In our view, this feature is probably an artefact of PIV analysis and is related to rotation of the hanging wall of fault 3 (or footwall of fault 7; see cross-sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g). This block rotates (clockwise in sections a-a\u2019 and b-b\u2019 in Fig. 7g) around a horizontal axis due to the listric geometry of fault 3 (Fig. 7h). While the entire block moves away from the indenter due to extension, the rotation brings the segment of this block located away from fault 3 up and towards the footwall (Fig. 7h). In map view such displacement creates local apparent shortening (Fig. 7h). A similar, but less expressed, feature can be observed also in the model 2 above the fault 3 (Fig. 5). Towards the south, the basin narrows significantly (Fig. 7e and cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 7g) until the strike-slip deformation starts its transfer to transpression and creates a positive topography (cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 7g). The main strike-slip fault system (1, 2 and 9 in Fig. 7e and f) propagates south-wards (16 in Fig. 7e and f and cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 7g) and overprints the thrust wedge.\n\n\n\n5\nEffects of extension(s) on strain partitioning and deformation transfer around an indenter\nThe previous study of Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021) has shown that deformation transfer during indentation without an additional externally driven extension is controlled mainly by the geometry of the indenter. The new modelling results of this study exhibit similar features to Krstekani\u0107 et al. (2021) for similar modelling setups (model 1) but differ for areas which are affected by extensional boundary conditions (models 2\u20134). All models show similar deformation patterns with the formation of a thrust wedge (overprinted by low-offset normal faulting due to gravitational collapse; compare cross-section c-c\u2019 in Fig. 4g, cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 5g, cross-section d-d\u2019 in Fig. 6g and cross-section e-e\u2019 in Fig. 7g) with almost similar topographic height (4.4\u00a0cm, 4.3\u00a0cm, 4.1\u00a0cm and 4.3\u00a0cm for models 1\u20134, respectively) in the south and its transition to transpression and strike-slip south-west of the indenter (Figs. 4\u20137). This suggests that extension imposed on the north-western and northern model boundary did not affect the deformation at the southern and south-western model areas. In contrast, significant subsidence associated with transtension and normal faulting creating isolated or connected basins is observed along the northern, north-western and western indenter's margins in models that allow extension at their margins (models 2\u20134, Figs. 5\u20137).\nThis extension and resulting subsidence are driven by the flow of the viscous layer in the direction of the free margin(s). Such flow of the viscous substratum underneath the brittle overburden is always a combination of a Poiseuille (the largest flow velocity in the middle of the viscous layer) and a Couette (the flow velocity in the viscous layer increases upwards) flows (Gemmer et al., 2004, 2005). With the progress of extension and the formation of the sedimentary basins, the effect of the Couette flow increases in the area beneath the sedimentary basins compared to the Poiseuille flow (Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007). This leads to the thinning of, and in cases of extreme extension, to breaking of the viscous layer. Effects of the viscous flow velocities on the model evolution are related to the rheological and geometrical characteristics of the model layers (Weijermars et al., 1993; Gemmer et al., 2004, 2005; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2007; Brun and Fort, 2011). In our models, we do not vary the rheology and initial thickness of our model layers and add syn-kinematic sediments in the same way (see section 3.3) in all models. Therefore, we consider that observed structural differences in our models are not related to the variability of the viscous flow velocities, but the general flow direction.\n\n5.1\nThe influence of the northern extension\nExtension along the northern boundary creates a NNE to ENE oriented displacement field in the area north of the indenter (Fig. 8\na) resulting in a large basin with a curved southern margin, controlled by the geometry of the indenter's NW corner. West-wards, the basin is bound by a strike-slip to transtensional fault system (Figs. 5e and 8d) that has numerous splays curved to the east, along which the connection with normal faulting is ultimately established. The extension evolves gradually, which results in a segmented basin that has several elongated depo-centres (yellow dashed lines in Fig. 8d), separated by intra-basinal highs of different elevation (red dashed lines in Fig. 8d; see also cross-sections in Fig. 8g). The largest basin depth is observed in the vicinity of the NW indenter's corner, reaching 1.5\u00a0cm (cross-sections 2 and 3 in Fig. 8g). South-wards, the basin narrows and becomes less deep, as the influence of the north-ward extension decreases. The southern tip of the basin is located at the transition of the curved NW corner to the straight N\u2013S oriented indenter's margin. This is the area where the main strike-slip deformation changes its kinematics, from transtension in the north to transpression in the south, while inverting the basin at the same time. This inversion results in the positive topography of the model and uplift of the basin floor (the elevation of the basin floor is, locally, higher than the original model surface in Fig. 8d; red arrows in cross-section 6 in Fig. 8g).\n\n\n5.2\nThe influence of the western extension\nWest-ward directed gravity spreading along the western model boundary combined with the north-ward motor-induced pull create a displacement field oriented towards NW (Fig. 8b), which distributes strike-slip deformation west-wards and adds a transtensional component. Such coupled strike-slip and extension partition the deformation in two elongated\u00a0\u223c\u00a0N\u2013S oriented transtensional corridors that control basin formation (Fig. 8e). These elongate basins merge south-wards and reach up to the centre of the N\u2013S oriented western margin of the indenter (marked by the dashed black marker line in Fig. 8e). With the cessation of the western extension, the strike-slip deformation takes over, inverting the basins, especially the one along the main eastern strike-slip corridor (Fig. 8e). This inversion is observed by uplift of the basin infill and its deformed floor (cross-sections in Fig. 8h), which implies that the relatively shallow basin system (less than 0.5\u00a0cm depth; see cross-section 3 in Fig. 8h) was deeper before inversion.\n\n\n5.3\nThe influence of the coeval and coupled bi-directional extensions\nWhen extension is bi-directional, the influence of extension along the northern boundary dominates over that along the western boundary, because more extension is applied along the former. The early model displacements are oriented to the NNW in the west, which changes to NE in the east (Fig. 8c). Similar to the model 2 (Fig. 8d), the northern extension creates a large basin with a curved southern margin and numerous elongated sub-basins and intra-basinal highs (Fig. 8f). These sub-basins are, in top-view, more often dissected, less continuous and wider towards the west when compared with model 2 (compare Fig. 8d with 8f). This is due to the north-west-ward flow of the silicone that distributes deformation over a wider area (compare Fig. 8a with 8c). The basin extends farther south-wards where the tip of the basin reaches central regions of the western indenter's margin, similar to model 3 (compare Fig. 8e with 8f). The basin reaches 1.3\u00a0cm depth (cross-sections 1 and 3 in Fig. 8i), which is \u223c13% less when compared with model 2, where the basin was about 1.5\u00a0cm deep, which indicates an extension and associated subsidence distributed over a larger area. The southern tip of the basin was likely inverted, which is suggested by the associated uplift resulting in positive basin infill topography (cross-section 6 in Fig. 8i). This inversion is the largest in the model with only northward extension and is lowest in the case when both extensions are present in the model (compare cross-sections 6 in Figs. 8g, 2 and 3 in Figs. 8h and 6 in Fig. 8i). Therefore, the northern extension controls the opening of a wider basin, the internal distribution of fault offsets, subsidence and the connection to the curved strike-slip faulting along the western indenter's margin. The west-ward extension creates a transtensional deformation regime with subsidence along N\u2013S oriented strike-slip faults, pulling and distributing the deformation towards the west, allowing for an additional, but relatively minor amount of subsidence west of the indenter.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for the indentation processes\nExisting modelling studies that investigate indentation and resulting shortening indicate that lateral extrusion during indentation requires a weaker crust and\/or lithosphere rheology to be present laterally in the system (e.g., Ratschbacher et al., 1991a; Sokoutis et al., 2000; Rosenberg et al., 2004; van Gelder et al., 2017), associated or not with extension driven by slab roll-back (e.g., Faccenna et al., 1996; Philippon et al., 2014; Schellart et al., 2019) and sometimes coupled with a collapse and spreading of orogenic wedges (Faccenna et al., 1996; Kydonakis et al., 2015). When the lateral margins are confined, there is no lateral extrusion and deformation is transferred only around the indenter and partitioned between shortening, transpression and strike-slip deformation depending on the indenter geometry (Zweigel 1998; Luth et al., 2013; Schellart et al., 2019; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2021). These results imply that a form of extension or gravity spreading at a high angle to indentation shortening along one or multiple margins of the system is essential for lateral extrusion in indentation systems. Our models are in agreement with these previous inferences, but further imply that the amount of extension and thus space generated by this process is critical for lateral extrusion to occur. In cases of limited externally-driven extension, the structural complexity increases by adding an extensional component to indentation-induced deformation, but it will not lead to large-scale extrusion of fault-bound crustal blocks.\n\n\n\n6\nImplications for the evolution of the Carpatho-Balkanides\nThe Circum-Moesian Fault System associated with the Carpatho-Balkanides backarc-convex oroclinal bending partitions the deformation around the Moesian Platform indenter in a similar way as in our analogue models, from transtension and strike-slip to transpression and shortening (Figs. 2 and 9\n; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020, 2021, 2022). This deformation was coeval with roll-back of the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slabs that together created the observed bimodal back-arc extension (Fig. 9; see also Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012).\nOur models suggest that the extension and transtension north and north-west of the indenter can be indeed explained by the bimodal N\u2013S and E-W oriented extension. The roll-back of the Carpathian embayment slab pulled its upper plate creating the orogen-parallel N\u2013S, NE-SW to ENE-WSW oriented extension in the Serbian and South Carpathians and their foreland due to the corner effect of Moesia (e.g., Schmid et al., 1998; Matenco and Schmid, 1999; Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown 4\u20136\u00a0km of maximum Oligocene - early Miocene subsidence in various locations within the Getic Depression (e.g., Matenco et al., 2003; R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013), which is smaller when compared with our models (1.3\u20131.5\u00a0cm in models scale to \u223c10\u00a0km in nature). Owing to the subsequent post-early Miocene basin inversion and burial to large depths (\u223c10\u00a0km) in the proximity of the South Carpathians, these studies were not able to establish a very precise internal geometry of the Oligocene - Early Miocene basin beyond a potential separation in northern and southern sub-basins by an intermediary high (e.g., Fig. 1b in R\u0103b\u0103gia et al., 2011 or Fig. 7 in Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013), which connect gradually to the west and SW in the present-day geometry. Our bi-modal extension results (Fig. 8f) predict a similar geometry and furthermore suggest that the Oligocene - early Miocene sediment thicknesses are similar in transects across sub-basins, but with higher northern values in the central Getic Depression. Although the detailed fault geometry and distribution is somewhat different, the deformation transfer and interplay between Timok Fault strike-slip offset to N- to NE-wards transtension and further east-wards normal faulting in the Getic Depression shows clear resemblance with our north and bi-modal extension models (see R\u0103b\u0103gia and Ma\u0163enco, 1999; Kr\u00e9zsek et al., 2013).\nThe size of the modelled basins, which reflects the combined effect of extension and strike-slip faulting, is for several reasons exaggerated when compared to the Getic Depression. Most importantly, extension rates are exaggerated in our models, which are, though smaller than the strike-slip rates, higher than extension rates in the natural case. At the same time, the contribution of the strike-slip deformation in the Getic Depression is higher in the natural case than in our models (e.g., Schmid et al., 2008, and references therein). Furthermore, we note that the position of the pole of rotation, which has been chosen following regional kinematic reconstructions and available paleomagnetic studies (e.g., Balla, 1987; F\u00fcgenschuh and Schmid, S.M., 2005; Panaiotu and Panaiotu, 2010; van Hinsbergen et al., 2020), also impacts the amount of extension as a function of distance from the rotation pole. Our models do not account for pre-existing topography at the onset of basin formation in the South Carpathians (e.g., Moser et al., 2005), which directly impacts on the size of the resulting basins. In the natural case, the interplay of strike-slip and extension\/transtension was distributed not only in the Getic Depression but also in the central and western part of the South Carpathians, where transtensional and extensional basins, such as the Petro\u015fani, Caransebe\u015f-Mehadia and Bozovici basins (Fig. 2b) formed during Oligocene - middle Miocene and are controlled by interacting strike-slip and normal faults, both orogen-parralel and orogen-perpendicular (e.g., Ratschbacher et al., 1993; Linzer et al., 1998; Matenco and Schmid, 1999; Codrea, 2001; Moser et al., 2005; H\u00edr et al., 2016). Furthermore, the coeval interplay between strike-slip and normal faulting led to renewed deposition in the earlier formed Late Cretaceous Ha\u0163eg Basin of the South Carpathians (Linzer et al., 1998, and references therein). Nevertheless, these natural observations are also reflected in our models showing that transtensional\/extensional deformation affected a larger area than the present-day Getic Depression.\nThe geometry of the extension along the western model margin is very similar to the one of the orogen-perpendicular extension in the Morava Valley Corridor, which is probably driven by the Adriatic slab roll-back, affecting only the hinge area of the Carpatho-Balkanides back-arc convex orocline (Figs. 2 and 9, the westernmost side of the Serbian Carpathians bordering the Morava Valley Corridor, Matenco and Radivojevi\u0107, 2012; Erak et al., 2017; Sant et al., 2018; Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020). This Oligocene - Miocene orogen-perpendicular extension decreases gradually E\u2212 and S- wards (Krstekani\u0107 et al., 2020), while extending with time during the middle Miocene to the SW into the external Dinarides (Andri\u0107 et al., 2018; van Unen et al., 2019 and references therein). Our modelling results show that the west-ward extension allows for the partitioning of strike-slip deformation into multiple sub-parallel strike-slip faults that merge into a single deformation zone along the western margin of the indenter. The connecting geometry and observed west-ward continuation of the orogen perpendicular extension is realistic in the model with bimodal extension when compared with the observed fault geometry and splaying characteristics (compare Fig. 2b with Figs. 7e and 8f, e.g., splaying the Timok offset along the Sokobanja-Zvonce and Rtanj-Pirot faults in Fig. 2b). These observations infer that the geometry of the Circum-Moesian Fault System requires the Morava Valley extension to be coupled with the oroclinal bending and orogen-parallel extension. The shallow (<1\u00a0km) E-W oriented intra-montane basins of the Serbian Carpathians (Fig. 2) were not reproduced by our modelling, possibly because of the limited gravity spreading created at the margins of our model, which does not completely reproduce the likely larger horizontal forces exerted by a slab roll-back, remaining a feature for further study.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe studied the effects of externally driven extension on strain partitioning and deformation transfer around an indenter by the means of analogue modelling. We have built four crustal scale analogue models where the deformable crust is translated and rotated around a stationary rigid indenter, while the externally driven extension is simulated by allowing the viscous layer to flow in directions parallel and perpendicular to the indenter margins. This allowed a quantitative assessment of the effects of superposed extension on the evolution of a strike-slip dominated deformation zone during indentation.\nPrevious studies have shown that the indenter geometry controls the style of deformation and that strike-slip at the margin of the indenter is gradually connected to shortening in its frontal part. Our modelling results show that the additional extension with a direction parallel to the strike-slip zone is responsible for the opening of a large sedimentary basin behind the indenter, characterised by sub-basins and intra-basinal highs, which are controlled by strain partitioning between the curved strike-slip, transtensional and normal faults. Furthermore, this extension stimulates an increase in the strike-slip faults curvature by connecting them with the basin-controlling normal faults. The extension perpendicular to the strike-slip system distributes deformation away from the indenter, creating a strike-slip system splaying into two zones of transtensional to strike-slip deformation that connect in the south and accommodate additional minor subsidence along N\u2013S oriented transtensional faults. The modelling furthermore shows that bi-modal parallel and perpendicular extension controls the first-order structure and extent (west-ward and south-ward) of the subsidence in the basin.\nThe modelling results infer that the Circum-Moesian Fault System was affected by extensions in different directions driven by the Carpathian embayment and Adriatic slab roll-backs. The extension in the north opened the Getic Depression, partitioned the strike-slip deformation and increased the curvature of the large Cerna and Timok faults and connected them with normal faults. The west-ward pull of the Adriatic slab added a component of transtensional deformation to the strike-slip system during the indentation by the Moesian Platform and contributed to splaying strike-slip deformation west-wards.\nOur modelling results demonstrate that the deformation transfer around rigid indenters can be significantly affected by far-field extension involving enhanced subsidence in newly formed basins, distributing deformation over a wider area and increasing in oblique kinematics along differently oriented faults, which create complex strain partitioning patterns.\n\n\nData availability\nAll raw unprocessed data related to this study are deposited in the Yoda data repository system of Utrecht University with the DOI number 10.24416\/UU01\u2013N7TDVH and can be accessed via: https:\/\/public.yoda.uu.nl\/geo\/UU01\/N7TDVH.html.

Well-established examples include mesothermal vein gold mineralization associated with ductile-brittle strike-slip shear zones (Robert et al., 2005; Micklethwaite et al., 2010; Wiemer et al., 2021), epithermal gold deposit hosted within brittle vein or dilatant fault networks at depths of less than 1\u00a0km (Simmons et al., 2005; Micklethwaite, 2009; Leary et al., 2016), and sediment-hosted (Carlin-type) gold mineralization associated with large-scale dip-slip faults (Hickey et al., 2014). Therefore, mineralizations associated with shear zones, veins and faults may be related to these pre-existing structural heterogeneities and\/or to the processes that operated when these tectonic structures were active.\nShear zones, veins and faults associated to a fault system often exhibit systematic patterns in their geometry and scaling properties (Cowie et al., 1995; Bonnet et al., 2001; Davis, 2002). These systematic patterns are the cumulative result of multiple displacement events in the tectonic structure (Sibson, 2001), thus having implications in the formation and spatial location of mineral deposits in the upper crust (Boullier and Robert et al., 2005; Woodcock et al., 2007). Mineral deposits controlled by geological structures were often formed by processes with episodic behavior. Textures of multiple overprinting phases of brecciation and crack-seal in veins hosting ore are typical examples of this behavior as a \u201cfault-valve\u201d structure (Sibson, 1990, 1992, 2020; Cox, 2005). These textures can indicate dilatant faulting and repeated episodes of highly focused fluid flow along the structure due to overpressure (Peacock et al., 2017a), prior to the new cementation and sealing by precipitation of material transported in solution.\nIn the upper crust, typical geometric features of shear zones and faults are segmentation, multiple en-\u00e9chelon segments, development of stepover zones (contractional and extensional), and braching at fault tips (Mann, 2007). Fault segmentation has been proposed to explain the spacing of mineral deposit clusters along structural systems (Robert et al., 2005; Micklethwaite et al., 2010). Mineralized faults and epithermal veins often comprise multiple segments that interact or link with adjacent segments across stepovers. Stepovers represent zones of more distributed strain, typically containing second-order structures such as branch faults, fracture networks and folds (Mann, 2007). Mineralization specifically is hosted in, or associated with, small displacement structures, some of which link across the stepover (Simmons et al., 2005).\nFaults typically provide the pathways for fluids, volatile and metals to migrate upwards from magmatic-hydrothermal sources towards the surface (Sillitoe, 2010, 2015; Heinrich et al., 2004; Hedenquist and Taran, 2013). In this shallow crustal environment, a subsurface volumetrically significant alteration domain can be formed when ascending acidic magmatic-hydrothermal fluids react with wallrocks (Cooke et al., 2014). The resulting lithocap is characterized by development of a lithologically and\/or structurally controlled zoned hydrothermal alteration, which provide criteria for epithermal mineralization exploration in conjunction to the geological structure (Hedenquist and Arribas, 2017).\nIn the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes (18\u00b0\u201328\u00b0 S), temporal and causal relationships between regional deformation, volcanic activity and related mineralization during Neogene are currently under discussion. The various alternatives proposed include: (1) variations in the regional stress-field that cause imbalance in a magmatic system close to the eruption (Sulpizio and Massaro 2017); (2) the (re)activation of crustal-scale N, NW and NE-striking fault zones that localize the volcanism (Riller et al., 2001; Trumbull et al., 2006; Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2014; Tibaldi et al., 2017); (3) volcanic chains location related to the intersection between orogen-parallel N-striking structures and transversal NW-striking structures (Chernicoff et al., 2002; Richards et al., 2006; Trumbull et al., 2006; Seggiaro et al., 2019); and (4) the formation of large volcanic collapse calderas in relation to NW-trending lineaments, the NW-directed transtensive deformation or the transfer of movement between N-striking faults from the early Miocene (Petrinovic et al., 2010, 2017, 2021; Norini et al., 2013, 2014; Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2017; de Silva and Kay, 2018; Seggiaro et al., 2021).\nIn order to shed some light on the matter, this paper present structural data at macroscopic and mesoscopic scales, fault-slip data inversion and 40Ar-39Ar geochronology data for volcanic rocks, hydrothermally altered lithological equivalents and associated epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization of the Quevar Volcanic Complex (QVC). The QVC is a large stratovolcano related to Neogene magmatism of the Central Andean Volcanic Zone, located in the Puna of the NW Argentina (Figs. 1 and 2\n\n; Kay et al., 1999; Quade et al., 2015; Petrinovic et al., 2017; Ramos, 2017). These data allow us to: (1) to determine the spatial and temporal relationships among felsic volcanism, hydrothermal alteration, epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization and diverse tectonic structures; (2) to establish the kinematics of faults measured in late Miocene volcanic rock; (3) to calculate the regional stress regime derived from the inversion of fault-slip data; and (4) to obtain the absolute age of the hosting volcanic rocks, the hydrothermal alteration and the associated epithermal mineralization. Finally, in conjunction with published regional data, we propose a structural evolutive model that integrates the volcanic, tectonic, hydrothermal alteration and mineralization processes in the QVC during the late Miocene.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nThe Altiplano-Puna plateau of the Central Andes\nThe geological domain of Altiplano-Puna is part of the Andean orogen, together with the Western Cordillera, the Eastern Cordillera, the Sub-Andean and the Sierras Pampeanas (Fig. 1). It constitutes a high elevation plateau (\u223c4\u00a0km above sea level, average) located east of the Central Volcanic Zone segment of the Cenozoic Andean magmatic arc, which is related to the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate (Allmendinger et al., 1997; Riller and Oncken, 2003; Ramos, 2009). The Puna is morphologically characterized by orogen-parallel N-trending mountain ranges cored by Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic rocks, separated by wide basins filled with Cenozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. In both the Puna and the Eastern Cordillera, the Lower Paleozoic and Cretaceous older structures controlled the Andean shortening, the architecture of the orogen and the evolution of the foreland basin during the Paleogene (Hongn et al., 2007; Norini et al., 2013; Quade et al., 2015; Montero-L\u00f3pez et al., 2017; Seggiaro et al., 2017).\nDuring the Cenozoic, the Altiplano-Puna plateau of the Central Andes was developed by the continuous subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate in a convergent margin setting. In the South American upper plate, the E to ENE-directed convergence developed E and W-vergent thrusts-and-folds systems sub-parallel to the Andean mountain range. This horizontal shortening produced the crustal thickening and uplift of the Puna plateau and the Eastern Cordillera, and was coeval with the deposition of thick syntectonic strata (Allmendinger et al., 1989, 1997; Marrett et al., 1994; Elger et al., 2005; Oncken et al., 2006; Giambiagi et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.2\nCalama-Olacapato-El Toro lineament\nThe general N\u2013S trend of the Andean folds and thrusts is locally rotated or interrupted by NW-trending structural lineaments (Fig. 1). Several authors relate the deflection in the trace of the regional Andean structures with the E to ENE-directed far stress field, which also produced the (re)activation and strike-slip motion on upper-crustal oblique fault zones or transfer zones, with displacements that can reach several tens of kilometers in the horizontal plane (Marrett et al., 1994; Riller and Oncken 2003; Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2019). These transverse structures have also controlled the distribution of late Cenozoic volcanism in the Central Andes, as well as the development of large volcanic collapse calderas (Riller et al., 2001; Ramelow et al., 2005; Richards et al., 2006; Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2014, 2017; Tibaldi et al., 2017), with associated hot springs and polymetallic mineralizations.\nIn the northern Puna, the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro lineament (COT) controlled the building of a NW-trending volcanic chain in the upper Miocene, composed of the Rinc\u00f3n, Guanaquero, Chivinar, Tul-Tul, del Medio, Pocitos and Quevar stratovolcanoes (Fig. 2; Matteini et al., 2002; Acocella et al., 2011; Petrinovic et al., 2017). The origin of the transverse lineaments has been related to changes in the convergence angle between the Nazca and South America plates (Marrett et al., 1994), the orogen-parallel stretching (Riller and Oncken, 2003; Riller et al., 2001), or with transfer zones between thrust systems (Seggiaro and Hongn, 1999; Petrinovic et al., 2010; Norini et al., 2013; Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.3\nNeogene stress-field evolution in the Altiplano-Puna\nThe Altiplano-Puna crust has been deformed for the last time during the Andean orogeny from the early Oligocene to the late Miocene. Following the Eocene onset of shortening at the western protoplateau margin, two main shortening peaks can be distinguished (e.g. Elger et al., 2005): early Oligocene (33-27\u00a0Ma) and middle\/late Miocene (19-8\u00a0Ma). This early compressional stage dominated by E to ESE-directed horizontal shortening and lithospheric thickening was followed by a late Miocene to Recent stage characterized N to NNW-directed horizontal extension, which controlled the storage and eruption of caldera-related magmas (Allmendinger et al., 1989; Marrett et al., 1994; Cladouhos et al., 1994; Riller et al., 2001; Elger et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2013; Daxberger and Riller, 2015). In the Western Cordillera, which represents the western margin of the Altiplano-Puna plateau, four stress regimes since the middle Miocene times have been described (Giambiagi et al., 2016): (1) an early to middle Miocene pure compression; (2) a late Miocene transpression; (3) a latest Miocene-early Pliocene phase characterized by partitioned normal and strike-slip faulting; and (4) a late Pliocene to Quaternary horizontal extension. The transition from a compressional to an extensional stress regime (sensu\nPeacock et al., 2017b) took place between 13-10\u00a0Ma and 8-5\u00a0Ma in the northern and southern Puna plateau, respectively. This change has been related to the increase in cortical thicknesses and regional topographic elevation to exceed threshold values in crustal strength, producing the orogenic collapse and the transfer of active shortening to the sub-Andean fold and thrust belt (Marrett et al., 1994; Cladouhos et al., 1994; Elger et al., 2005; Giambiagi et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.4\nQuevar Volcanic Complex\nThe Quevar Volcanic Complex covers an area of about 1,500\u00a0km2 of the Salta Province in the Argentinean Puna. Outcrops of their volcanic rocks are generally located above 4,000\u00a0m, reaching altitudes between 5,810\u00a0m and 6,130\u00a0m above sea level (Fig. 2; Robl et al., 2009; Grosse et al., 2017; Petrinovic et al., 2017). The volume of volcanic materials emitted is estimated at 550\u00a0km3, giving rise to one of the largest stratovolcanoes in the Puna.\n\n2.4.1\nLithostratigraphic units\nThe QVC includes the effusive centers of Cerro El Quevar, Cerro Gordo and Cerro Azufre, which are aligned with the NW-trending COT (Fig. 2). The QVC is made from bottom to top by the following late Miocene lithostratigraphic Formations (Fig. 3\n; Robl, 2003): Tajamar Ignimbrite, Rhyolites and Perlites, Quevar Dacite, Rumibola Andesite and Cumbres Dacite.\nThe Tajamar Ignimbrite outcrops on the N and SE flanks of the QVC. It constitutes up to 400\u00a0m-thick accumulation of pyroclastic flows of riodacitic to dacitic composition and K-rich calc alkaline geochemical affinity, have a late Miocene age (10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma; K\u2013Ar whole-rock) and are genetically related to the Aguas Calientes caldera (Petrinovic et al., 2010, 2017, 2021). The Rhyolites and Perlites unit outcrops along the Quebradas Incahuasi and Quir\u00f3n in the S and SW sectors of the QVC. It is made up of a devitrified rhyolitic extrusive dome, with brecciated and perlitic intrusive contacts. The Quevar Dacite constitutes the most extensive unit in the QVC and is made up of dacitic lavas and more subordinate pyroclastic deposits of block and ash flows emitted from various eruptive centers (Robl et al., 2009). In the Quebrada Incahuasi these deposits overlain the Rhyolites and Perlites unit. Typically, the dacites contain abundant phenocrysts of plagioclase and less abundant of pyroxene, hornblende, and biotite. Quartz phenocrysts are rare or absent. They include hornblende and plagioclase-rich mafic enclaves, suggesting a mixing of mafic and felsic magmas. The Rumibola Andesite unconformably overlain the Quevar Dacite. It includes the Azufre Andesite Member, which is composed of the andesitic lavas that outcrop at the Cerros Mamaturi and Quir\u00f3n, as well as in the sector between the Cerros Azufre and Gordo. The Azufre Andesite thus records the transfer of volcanic activity to the SW sector of the QVC. The breccia and fumarolic sulfur deposits of Cerro Azufre define a semicircular structure related to a chimney of the volcano (Robl et al., 2009). The Esquina Azul Andesite Member integrates the andesitic-basaltic lavas emitted in the N sector of the QVC, which has provided an age of 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma (K\u2013Ar whole-rock; Petrinovic et al., 2010). The Cumbres Dacite is formed by dacitic lavas rich in centimetric phenocrystals of sanidine, which cover the summits of Cerros Quevar and Gordo in the central sector of the QVC (Robl et al., 2009).\nOverall, the QVC recorded a magmatic evolution from acidic to intermediate-basic compositional terms. The sequence began with the basal rhyolites of Quebradas Quir\u00f3n and Incahuasi, continued with the main dacites of the central sector, and culminated with the andesites and basaltic andesites of the SW and N sectors. The final Cumbres Dacite departs from this compositional evolution.\n\n\n2.4.2\nHydrothermal alteration\nThe QVC includes a pervasive lithocap located on the southwestern flank of the stratovolcano, along the Quebradas Incahuasi, Toro Grande and Mamaturi, where the hydrothermal alteration has an areal extension of about 50\u00a0km2 and reaches a vertical thickness of 1.2\u00a0km (Robl et al., 2009; this work). Hydrothermal alteration affects the volcanic rocks of the Quevar Dacite, but it is not developed in the Azufre Andesite and in the Cumbres Dacite (Figs. 3 and 4\n). This alteration was apparently more intense in the volcaniclastic facies of breccia and tuff than in the coherent lavas. Following Cooke et al. (2014), it is possible to distinguish several mineralogical types of alteration in the Quebrada Incahuasi, which are briefly described below (see also Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021).\nThe dacites and andesites located near the summit of Cerro Fernando and to the S of the Vince deposit show a variable propylitic alteration. At the microscale, it is characterized by the partial or total pseudomorphic replacement of volcanic ferromagnesian minerals by secondary aggregates of chlorite, epidote and calcite, as well as plagioclase by calcite, epidote and zeolites. The volcanic groundmass has completely recrystallized to a very fine-grained aggregate composed of epidote, white mica, montmorillonite group minerals and zeolites. Between the zeolites, Robl et al. (2009) identify heulandite (stable at T\u00a0<\u00a0210\u00a0\u00b0C), clinoptilolite, laumontite and yugawaralite. This mineral assemblage is typical of the epidote subzone of a low temperature propylitic alteration (e.g. Cooke et al., 2014), which is probably genetically related to the depth intrusion of a hydrous porphyry stock. Spatially associated with the propylitic alteration there is a replacement of the primary ferromagnesian minerals by pyrite, accompanied by the pseudomorphosis of feldspars and the groundmass by albite, quartz and zeolites.\nThe phyllic alteration is associated with the fault and breccia zones located eastern Filo Quespejahuar and southern Cerro Fernando, as well as the vicinity of the Armon\u00eda deposit. At the microscale, it is characterized by the replacement of plagioclase and the volcanic matrix by an aggregate of very fine-grained phyllosilicates.\nThe argillic, advanced argillic and silicic alterations present a great extension in the Quebrada Incahuasi, defining a broadly stratabound domain of approximately 1\u00a0km-thick and more than 3\u00a0km of visible lateral extension. These hydrothermal alterations caused the progressive loss of the volcanic mineralogy and textures. The transformation and leaching of the rock gave rise to its progressive whitening, highlighting in the landscape of the Quebrada Incahuasi (Fig. 4a). At the microscale and with an increasing degree of argillic alteration, the mineral association of montmorillonite, halloysite and illite is replaced by alunite, kaolinite, quartz, gypsum and sulfur. Alunite is especially abundant on the Filo Quespejahuar. Advanced argillic alteration is frequently accompanied by intense silicification. Leaching of volcanic phenocrysts and replacement of the groundmass by aggregates of very fine-grained quartz and\/or amorphous silica results in vuggy-quartz textures. Both advanced argillic and silicic alterations overlap the propylitic alteration. Hypogene silicic, advanced argillic and argillic-altered rocks volumetrically define a lithocap in the sense of Cooke et al. (2014), which was formed by extensive water-rock interaction when acidic magmatic-hydrothermal fluids reacted with wallrock dacites during ascent towards the paleosurface (Sillitoe, 2010, 2015; Hedenquist and Taran, 2013). Therefore, it was probably formed above a shallow-crustal unexposed, hydrous intrusive complex.\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi (Fig. 3), the lithocap is zoned and characterized by an outwards transition from a central silicic core composed of residual quartz (with massive and\/or vuggy textures), through advanced argillic alteration (typically quartz-alunite) to argillic (quartz-kaolinite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0illite) and propylitic (chlorite-calcite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0epidote) assemblages (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021). The fumarole sulfur deposits located at the highest topographic levels of Cerro Azufre and southward Cerro Fernando constitute the places of superficial discharge of the magmatic volatiles, probably located directly above the main upflow zone.\nAt elevations above 4500\u00a0m above sea level, precipitation\/alteration products forming surficial insoluble minerals are widespread and related to a paleo-relief surface developed on top of Quevar Dacite. This supergenic alteration is characterized by the formation of iron oxides\/hydroxides, clay minerals, manganese oxides and silica, which stains the rock in red-orange colors (Fig. 5\ng). At the microscale, it is made up of jarosite, goethite, hematite and limonite, among other minerals (Fig. 5h). The Rumibola Andesite and Cumbres Dacite unconformably overlie this leached cap.\n\n\n2.4.3\nEpithermal mineralization\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi, the QVC contains a polymetallic epithermal system of Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn (Sb, As, Bi), which has been exploited mainly in the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar mineral deposits (Figs. 3 and 4). These deposits have been exploited intermittently, having provided about 3,000 tons of ore, with an average grade of 8.06% Pb and 0.26% Ag. Mineralization is located (Robl, 2003; Robl et al., 2009): (1) in vein systems and breccia cement; and (2) disseminated in pockets and more irregular domains of hydrothermaly altered rocks. The first type of deposit is mainly located along a ca. 3\u00a0km long, ENE-trending band (Fig. 3).\n\nRobl et al. (2009) distinguish two main stages of mineralization. The first stage is made up of various mineral species of Ag in the Armonia deposit, which are members of the lillianite and andorite groups, as well as bournonite, galena and pyrite. The second stage consists mainly of galena and lead sulfosalts in barite gangue, among other mineral phases, which is present in all deposits. A third stage would be established in the minerals formed and metals remobilized during the supergenic alteration. Robl et al. (2009) indicate that mineralization is generally associated with vuggy-quartz, in the form of very fine-grained sulfides and sulfosalts, cementing the microbreccias of the host volcanic rock and filling the voids originated during the leaching of volcanic phenocrysts (Fig. 5e and f). The microtextural relationships between neotectonic structures and mineralization will be presented elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nMineralized veins and fault-slip data analysis\nStress or strain can be evaluated using inversion methods of brittle fault-slip data (Angelier, 1994). It involves collecting data of fault plane orientations, fault striae directions and sense of slip from kinematic indicators at the outcrop scale. Mesoscopic kinematic indicators used to infer the sense of slip on the fault-plane along the striae direction were the growth of fibrous crystals in steps, R and P-Riedel shears, grooves and crescent fractures, among others (e.g. Petit, 1987). In order to obtain from fault-slip data the principal stress axes (\u03c31\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c32\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c33) and the stress ratio R = (\u03c32-\u03c33\/\u03c31-\u03c33) that best fit the reduced stress tensor at a given site, several inversion methods have been proposed (see reviews by C\u00e9l\u00e9rier et al., 2012; Sperner and Zweigel, 2010; Twiss and Unruh, 1998). Using multiple methods, hence different algorithms, will allow us to increase accuracy in the results by reducing the effect of systematic errors.\nIn natural conditions, fault-slip data sets measured at one location can be polyphasic, that is, include several fault subpopulations consistent with different stress tensors. The separation of the fault subpopulations referring to each tensor was performed prior to the inversion method for stress, calculating the pressure (P or compression axis) and tension (T or tensional axis) axes for each fault-slip data. Appearance of several clusters of P or T axes in stereographic projection were interpreted as indicative of the existence of fault-slip data related to different paleostress tensors, allowing their separation in fault subpopulations. Fault cross-cutting relationships, the overprinting of several striations in the same fault plane and the absolute age of the faulted rocks have also been used as criteria to date faults and thus paleostress tensors and tectonic phases.\nVisualization of the fault-slip data in stereographic projection, statistical processing and inversion of the fault-slip data was performed with the TectonicsFP v1.7.9 software of Reiter and Acs (2000) and Ortner et al. (2002). Fault-slip data analysis and principal stress axes calculation were first performed with the kinematic right-dihedra method (Angelier, 1994), which shows the distribution of the percentage of compression or extension dihedra in stereographic projection. Inversion of fault-slip data was accomplished after with two inverse independent methods (Ortner et al., 2002, and references herein): direct inversion and numeric dynamic analysis. On the other hand, mineralized epithermal veins generally present a late brittle reactivation of their planes, which does not allow to obtain an unambiguous state of stress during their formation by means of kinematic analysis. In these conditions, clustering of vein data using a mixed Bingham distribution was used for paleostress analysis (Yamaji et al., 2010; Yamaji and Sato, 2011). Bingham distributions, or the orientation distributions with orthorhombic symmetry, has been applied to infer the state of stress during formation of magmatic dykes, mineral veins and fractures (Yamaji and Sato, 2011). In these works, the symmetry axes of the Bringham distribution of planar anisotropies (\u03b51, \u03b52 and \u03b53 eigenvectors) correspond to the principal axes of the stress tensor (\u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33, respectively). Yamaji et al. (2010) further argue that the stress ratio R = (\u03c32\u2212\u03c33)\/(\u03c31\u2212\u03c33) of the stress field related to the formation of an epithermal vein set could be approximated by the ratio of the concentration parameters \u03ba2\/\u03ba1 of the Bringham distribution. Further explanation of the methodology of acquisition and analysis of mineralized veins and fault-slip data followed in this work is included in Appendix A of the electronic supplementary material.\n\n\n3.2\n\n40Ar\/39Ar geochronology analytical techniques\nRock samples for 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology were crushed and sieved to obtain fragments ranging in the size range from 0.1 to 0.5\u00a0mm. The samples were rinsed in dilute nitric acid, washed in deionized water, rinsed and then air-dried at room temperature. Whole rock chips were stacked in an irradiation capsule with similar-aged samples and neutron flux monitors (Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine, 28.02\u00a0Ma; Renne et al., 1998). The samples were irradiated at the McMaster Nuclear Reactor in Hamilton, Ontario, for 56 MWH, with a neutron flux of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 neutrons\/cm2. Analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a054) of 18 neutron flux monitor positions produced errors of <0.5% in the J value. The samples were step-heated at incrementally higher powers in the defocused beam of a 10\u00a0W CO2 laser (New Wave Research MIR10) until fused, at the Noble Gas Laboratory of the Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, University of British Columbia. The gas evolved from each step was analyzed by a VG5400 mass spectrometer equipped with an ion-counting electron multiplier. All measurements were corrected for total system blank, mass spectrometer sensitivity, mass discrimination, radioactive decay during and subsequent to irradiation, as well as interfering Ar from atmospheric contamination and the irradiation of Ca, Cl and K. Isotope production ratios were (40Ar\/39Ar)K\u00a0=\u00a00.0302, (37Ar\/39Ar)Ca\u00a0=\u00a01416.4306, (36Ar\/39Ar)Ca\u00a0=\u00a00.3952, Ca\/K\u00a0=\u00a01.83(37ArCa\/39ArK). The plateau and correlation ages were calculated using Isoplot 3.09 software (Ludwig, 2003). Errors are quoted at the 2\u03c3 (95% confidence) level and are propagated from all sources except mass spectrometer sensitivity and age of the flux monitor. The geologic time scale is from Cohen et al. (2013, updated in 2021).\n\n\n\n4\nStructure of the Quevar Volcanic Complex in the Quebrada Incahuasi\nThe structure of the QVC has been inferred from: (1) tectonic deformation affecting late Miocene volcanic rocks, hydrothermally altered equivalents and mineralization; (2) orientation of faults and folds at all scales; and (3) paleostress tensors and tectonic regimes deduced from the inversion of faults-slip data.\n\n4.1\nField structural relationships\nOur structural map compiled at the 1:10,000 scale covered the whole Quebrada Incahuasi and complements the work of Robl (2003). This fieldwork area was selected for its accessibility and for containing the main mineralized structures of the QVC. The geology of the Quebrada Incahuasi consists mainly of (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021): (1) scarce remnants of a lower extrusive dome of rhyolites; (2) an intermediate group of faulted and folded dacites and subordinately andesites; (3) an upper unaltered sequence of slightly faulted and tilted andesites and dacites, that unconformably overlie an erosive surface developed on the intermediate volcanic rocks; and (4) an unconformable cover of Quaternary gravitational, alluvial and fluvial deposits. The spatial distribution of these groups of rocks is included in the lithological-structural map and cross-sections of Figs. 3 and 4. The lower rhyolitic dome and the variably altered intermediate dacites, as well as the hosting epithermal mineralization, are deformed by strike-slip and extensional faults. The upper sequence of andesites and dacites are deformed by normal or normal-oblique faults and were not affected by hydrothermal alteration.\nField mapping, microscopic observations and XRD whole-rock analysis have allowed to distinguish several lithological types in the intermediate Quevar Dacite, depending on the degree of the replacement of the volcanic mineralogy and textures by hydrothermal mineral assemblages in the lithocap (Figs. 3 and 4; Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021). In general, the coherent facies show slight alteration and are made up of porphyritic dacites and minor andesites characterized by a massive or flow foliated internal structure. They exhibit porphyritic and aphanitic textures produced by cooling and solidification of magma. These characteristics indicate that these are silicic subaerial lavas and extrusive domes, with associate autobreccias linked to the advance of the flows. The unaltered pyroclastic facies are little or no-vesicular and consist mainly of block and ash flow deposits of dacite and subordinately rhyodacite and andesite composition (Fig. 5a), resulting from explosive volcanic eruptions. These fragmentary facies are composed of poorly vesicular silicic juvenile clasts, crystals and sparse to abundant lithic fragments.\nIn the altered rocks and with the progressive increase of the hydrothermal replacement, lithological types are distinguished with a slight or non-existent argillic alteration, a moderate argillic alteration and incipient feldspar destruction (Fig. 5b), an intense argillic alteration with complete texture destruction (Fig. 5c), an advanced argillic alteration and incipient silicification, and a pronounced silicification or residual vuggy-quartz (Fig. 5d). Transit between lithologic types may be gradual or relatively abrupt in the field, defining a spatial zonation in the hydrothermal alteration.\nThe upper unaltered sequence of andesites and dacites are part of the Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite, respectively. The Azufre Andesite is made up of subaerial lavas of andesite and minor dacite composition, porphyritic to aphanitic texture, little or no-vesicular, and with a massive to flow-banded internal structure. The Cumbres Dacite is composed of dacites and subordinately riodacites, in coherent facies of subaerial lavas, with a well-developed porphyritic texture and banded structure.\n\n\n4.2\nMacro and mesoscale structures\nThe spatial distribution of macrostructures deforming the Quevar Dacite, its volcanic basement, the lithocap and the hosting epithermal deposits is included in the structural map of Fig. 6\n. Structural analyses at all scales allow grouping structures into three main sets: (1) sub-vertical dykes and veins with epithermal mineralization; (2) strike-slip faults; and (3) normal faults. The appearance of these structures on the outcrop scale is shown in Fig. 7\n and their stereographic projection in Fig. 8\n. Field examples of crosscutting relations between different mesostructures are displayed in Fig. 9\n.\n\n4.2.1\nDykes and veins with epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization\nDykes and veins with epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn (Sb, As, Bi) mineralization occur along an ENE-trending band, which includes the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits (Fig. 6). They present a dominant ENE-trend and a sub-vertical dip both towards the NW and SE (Fig. 8). However, the vein orientation can locally change to a NE\/NNE and NW trend, as in the Vince deposit. At the outcrop scale, the individual veins have a millimeter to centimeter (<5\u00a0cm) thickness (Fig. 7a and b). Mineralized veins are grouped in swarms of subparallel structures whose thickness varies between 5\u00a0cm and 1\u00a0m, hosted in the Quevar Dacite with an argillic, advanced argillic and silicic hydrothermal alteration. In the Armon\u00eda deposit, mineralized vein swarms exhibit roughly subparallel silicification development.\n\n\n4.2.2\nStrike-slip faults\nThese brittle structures are organized into three sets of different orientation: (1) ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults; (2) NW to NNW-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults; and (3) NNE to N-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults. All of them have a high-dip angle (>65\u00b0) and contain striations with a low-pitch angle (<25\u00b0; Fig. 8), Strike-slip faults have been observed at all scales affecting the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar mineral deposits (Figs. 6 and 9). The ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults are cartographically dominant and are often disposed with an en-\u00e9chelon map pattern, laterally connected by NW to NNW-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults. The NNE to N-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults are less developed at all scales. The local development of ENE to E-trending anticlinal and synclinal folds with large wavelength and sub-horizontal axes (Fig. 6) is spatially associated to this strike-slip deformation.\nIn the Quespejahuar and Armon\u00eda deposits, the strike-slip faults deform the dacites variably affected by the argillic and advanced argillic alterations, the subparallel silicified bands, and the mineralized veins (Fig. 7c, d, e). In some sectors of the advanced argillic alteration, the development of alunite aggregates elongated along the mesoscopic strike-slip faults is frequent, as well as filling subparallel tension gashes. Some fault planes exhibit fills and impregnations of oxides and oxy-hydroxides of Fe, which have resulted from the oxidation of the sulfide mineralization and the mobilization\/precipitation of dissolved material within the fracture network (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.2.3\nNormal faults\nThe ENE to E and ESE-trending normal and oblique-normal faults exhibit high-dip angles towards the N and S (Fig. 8). These extensional structures have been observed at all scales, mainly on the southern slope of the Filo Incahuasi, along the Incahuasi valley, and in the sectors of the Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits. They produce important vertical block displacements and juxtapose rocks of different type and degree of hydrothermal alteration (Fig. 7h). On the southern slope of the Filo Incahuasi a normal fault system produced a vertical throw of about 75\u2013100\u00a0m on the lava flows of the Azufre Andesite (Fig. 7f and g). In the Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits, the ENE to E-trending normal faults contain striations characterized by high-pitch angles (>60\u00b0), which indicate a direct normal movement or with a small strike-slip component (Fig. 8). In these sectors, normal faults deform argillic alteration, silicification and the hosted mineralized veins. These extensional structures coexist with the ENE to E-trending strike-slip faults at both map and outcrop scales, so that both types of structures can be kinematically related or result from successive deformation phases that occur over time. However, the reactivation of the strike-slip surfaces as normal faults, evidenced by high-pitch angle striations overprinting low-pitch angle striations on the same ENE to E-trending planes (Fig. 9), as well as the kinematical compatibility (see fault-slip data inversion section), imply the existence of two deformation events.\n\n\n\n4.3\nStress field solutions obtained by inversion of mineralized veins and fault-slip data\nStress inversion of the mineralized vein sets and fault-slip data yield 11 stress tensors, whose geological characteristics and site locations in the Quebrada Incahuasi are reported in Appendix B, C and D. This compilation of stress tensors only includes data derived from veins and faults developed in volcanic rocks of late Miocene age. Appendix E includes the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, stress regime, kinematic type of faults and the immersion method used in each site, which are generally consistent with each other.\n\n4.3.1\nStress tensors obtained from the bingham distribution of mineralized dykes and veins\n\nFig. 8 shows the stereographic projection of the symmetry axes (\u03b51, \u03b52 and \u03b53) of the Bingham distribution of mineralized dykes and veins in 6 locations of the Quebrada de Incahuasi, relative to the maximum, intermediate and minimum plane pole concentration. The characteristics of the corresponding stress tensors are summarized in Appendix C. Stress tensors present a dominant ENE to NE-trend for the maximum horizontal stress (\u03c31) and a NNW to NW-trend for the minimum horizontal stress (\u03c33), indicating that the Quebrada de Incahuasi was subjected to a strike-slip stress regime during the formation of the mineralized dykes and veins. The obtained sub-vertical orientation of the \u03c32 stress axis is consistent with the frequent arrangement of mineralized veins in conjugate en-\u00e9chelon systems in plan view, where the sub-horizontal \u03c31 bisects the acute angle formed by the intersection of conjugate vein systems (Fig. 9). Sub-vertical mineralized structures were initially opened normal to the orientation of the sub-horizontal \u03c33 stress axis, which presents a relatively homogeneous NNW to NW-trend in all studied sites.\n\n\n4.3.2\nStress tensors obtained by inversion of fault-slip data\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi, reduced stress tensors were calculated from fault-slip data measured in 5 sites located near the main strike-slip fault zones and around the mineral deposits. The stereographic projections of the obtained principal stress axes from several inversion methods at each geographic site are shown in Fig. 8. Paleostress analysis was limited to the availability of rock outcrops with a sufficient number of fault-slip data, but the obtained results have allowed us to reconstruct the evolution of the stress regime in the late Miocene.\nIn the 18JE02 site of the Quespejahuar deposit, the stereographic projection of the fault planes and the low-pitch angle (<25\u00b0) of associated striae establishes that these are strike-slip faults (Appendix B). Aplication of the right-dihedra method to these strike-slip faults set gives a stress tensor whose principal stress axes \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 have an orientation (and relative value) of N232\u00b0E\/07 (0.49), N101\u00b0E\/79 (0.32) and N323\u00b0E\/08 (0.20), respectively. These results establish a NE-directed sub-horizontal shortening in a strike-slip regime (\u03c32 is sub-vertical, R\u00a0=\u00a00.09), which is reflected in a sub-vertical intersection in the compression and extension dihedral diagram. Inversion of the fault-slip data using the direct inversion method yields a similar stress tensor. The trend of the principal strain axes obtained by numeric dynamic analysis is also compatible, with \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 oriented N233\u00b0E\/08, N066\u00b0E\/82 and N323\u00b0E\/02 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.5), respectively.\n\nFig. 8 shows the results of the inversion method in the 18JE05 site located in the Armonia deposit. Stereographic projection of fault-slip data establishes the existence of sub-vertical faults characterized by striations with low and high-pitch angles, which indicate strike-slip and normal movement, respectively. Stereographic projection of P and T kinematic axes of all fault-slip data shows a great dispersion (Appendix B). However, the distribution of these axes allows separating two fault subsets compatible with strike-slip (sub-horizontal P axes) and extensional (sub-vertical P axes) stress regimes. Application of the right-dihedra method to the strike-slip fault set gives a stress tensor whose main stress axes \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 are N053\u00b0E\/00 (0.48), N144\u00b0E\/66 (0.31) and N322\u00b0E\/24 (0.24), respectively. Similarly, the values for principal stress axes obtained for the normal fault subset are N066\u00b0E\/88 (0.46), N261\u00b0E\/02 (0.33) and N171\u00b0E\/01 (0.21), respectively. Dihedral diagrams for each calculated stress tensor are characteristics of strike-slip and extensional faults. The application of the direct inversion method to the same fault sets gave rise to strike-slip and extensional tensors of very similar orientation. (Fig. 8). Using the numeric dynamic analysis for the strike-slip faults subpopulation, yields a compatible strain tensor of axes (\u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3) trending N060\u00b0E\/10, N194\u00b0E\/75 and N328\u00b0E\/10 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.55), respectively. Analogously, the principal strain axes obtained for the normal faults subpopulation are N045\u00b0E\/88, N262\u00b0E\/01 and N172\u00b0E\/01 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.47). In summary, inversion of the fault-slip data establishes the existence of two different stress tensors in the 18JE05 site of late Miocene age. As field data indicate that high-pitch angle striations indicative of an extensional movement are superimposed to low-pitch angle striations formed during a strike-slip movement (Fig. 9), the extensional stress tensor is more recent in time.\nThe result of the inversion of fault-slip data in site 18JE13 located near the power keg of the Quespejahuar deposit is included in Fig. 8. The stereographic projection of the measured sub-vertical faults characterized by striations with high-pitch angle establishes that these are normal faults. Their kinematic axes indicates that they were formed during a single deformation phase (Appendix B). Application of the right-dihedra method establishes an orientation for \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 of N069\u00b0E\/59 (0.46), N273\u00b0E\/29 (0.30) and N177\u00b0E\/11 (0.24), respectively. These results define a sub-vertical compression under an extensional regime in the NNW trend (\u03c31 is sub-vertical, R\u00a0=\u00a00.08), which is reflected in a sub-horizontal intersection in the compression and extension dihedral diagram (Fig. 8). Although independent of each other, the results obtained with the direct inversion and numeric dynamic analysis methods are compatible with right-dihedra method. For example, the trend of the main strain axes obtained by numeric dynamic analysis is N075\u00b0E\/75, N267\u00b0E\/15 and N177\u00b0E\/03 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.32).\n\nFig. 8 shows how the inversion of fault-slip data in site 18JE16 located in the Arena sector of the Incahuasi river upper valley also yielded two stress tensors: a strike-slip regime under ENE-directed shortening and an extensional regime of NNW trend. Stereographic projection of fault-slip data establishes the existence of sub-vertical faults characterized by striations with low and high-pitch angles, which indicate strike-slip and normal displacements. Their kinematic axes shows a large dispersion without a single well-defined maximum (Appendix B). Application of the right-dihedra method to the strike-slip fault set gives a tensor of axes \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33 with trends N059\u00b0E\/08 (0.48), N308\u00b0E\/67 (0.31) and N152\u00b0E\/21 (0.24), respectively. Similarly, the set of normal faults is compatible with a tensor of axes N091\u00b0E\/71 (0.41), N241\u00b0E\/16 (0.33) and N334\u00b0E\/09 (0.26). The right dihedral diagrams for each fault set are characteristics of strike-slip and extensional faults (Fig. 8). Application of the direct inversion method leads to similar results, which establishes strike-slip and extensional deformation regimes for each fault set. The principal strain axes (\u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3) obtained from numeric dynamic analysis for the strike-slip faults are N068\u00b0E\/20, N278\u00b0E\/67 and N162\u00b0E\/11 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.59). Analogously, the strain tensor obtained from the normal faults is N087\u00b0E\/80, N256\u00b0E\/09 and N346\u00b0E\/02 (\u0395\u00a0=\u00a00.47). Therefore, the tensors obtained from the different inversion methods are compatible with each other.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n40Ar\u201339Ar geochronology\nThe main objective of geochronology was to obtain the ages of the Quevar Dacite, the hydrothermal alteration and the Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn epithermal mineralization, as well as indirectly the age of coeval tectonic deformation. To fulfill this objective, dacites affected by a different degree of hydrothermal alteration were sampled and separated volcanic and hydrothermal mineral fractions with different closure temperatures (in the sense of Hodges, 2003) were analyzed. A summary of sample location, 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating experiments and the 40Ar-39Ar spectrum and isochron diagrams of mineral separates are reported in Appendix F of the electronic supplementary material.\nQV04 sample is a dacite collected in the lower stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite at the Armon\u00eda deposit. It corresponds to pyroclastic facies, with ash to block-size clasts, affected by a moderate argillic alteration and incipient destruction of the feldspar. In the vicinity, there are hot springs with a clear structural control in relation to ENE-trending faults. The obtained biotite plateau age is 4.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.33, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.81, 2\u03c3, including a J-error of 0.4%) for four steps (6\u20139) of the incremental heating and 84.0% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10\n). The inverse isochron age on six points is 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.25), with an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0Ma (Appendix F). The individual ages for the plateau have been calculated with the initial Ar ratio obtained from the isochron intersection. Although the collective interpretation of the geochronological results is addressed in a later section, given the late Miocene age of the Quevar Dacite (Robl et al., 2009), these results suggest the existence of a Zanclean age (early Pliocene) isotopic resetting thermal event, which reached temperatures above the biotite closure temperature (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C) or, alternatively, the opening of the system during the hydrothermal alteration process.\nA separate of the volcanic groundmass from QV04 sample has provided a plateau age of 9.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.85, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.55) for eight steps and 77.4% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age on eight points is 9.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.92), with an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 293\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma close to the atmospheric value (295.5). Given the quick cooling of the groundmass in volcanic conditions, the plateau age is an estimate of the extrusion age of the QV04 dacite in the Tortonian (late Miocene). A separate of plagioclase from sample QV04 has also provided a plateau age of 8.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.65, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.74) for nine steps and 90.8% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age on nine points is 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.94), with an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 284\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma. The rapid cooling of the felsic magma and the closing temperature of the plagioclase (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0225\u00a0\u00b0C) suggest that this plateau age corresponds to the dacite extrusion in the Tortonian, which is similar, within the error, to those obtained for the groundmass.\nQV10 sample is a porphyritic dacite lava, slightly affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration and devoid of mineralization. The sample was collected about 400\u00a0m SE of Quespejahuar deposit and represents the lower stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite. The obtained biotite plateau age is 7.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.32, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.90) for six steps and 85.4% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age obtained for the four points with the lowest temperature is 11.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6\u00a0Ma, for an 40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a018), which has a large error and is far from the atmospheric value. The inverse isochron age obtained for the six points of the highest temperature is 8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma, for an initial ratio 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0281\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.35), which is close to the atmospheric. Therefore, this age calculated from the high-T steps of the plateau is the best age estimation for biotite crystallization in the Tortonian. The inverse isochron on five first steps suggests Ar mobility through the mineral lattice causing a loss of 40Ar at low temperatures.\nA separate of the volcanic groundmass from QV10 sample has provided a plateau age of 9.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.88, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.52) for eight steps and 81.8% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The older ages obtained in the higher temperature increments suggest incorporation of older material in the groundmass or an Ar excess. The inverse isochron age obtained for eight points is 9.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0Ma, for an initial ratio 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0309.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.8). Given the quick cooling of the groundmass under volcanic conditions, the plateau age probably corresponds to the extrusion age of the dacite in the Tortonian.\nQV16B sample consists of a dacitic lava with small sulphide-mineralized veins and argillic alteration, collected at high stratigraphically levels of the Quevar Dacite. However, feldspar and biotite phenocrysts are apparently fresh. The obtained biotite plateau age is 6.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.22, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.99) for eleven steps and 91.9% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age obtained for ten points is 6.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\u00a0Ma, for a40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 301\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.23), which is close to the atmospheric value. Therefore, the plateau and inverse isochron ages are similar. These results suggest the existence of a Messinian age (highest Miocene) thermal event with isotopic resetting, which reached temperatures higher than \u223c400\u00a0\u00b0C or, more likely, the opening of the system during the hydrothermal alteration process.\nA separate of the groundmass with hydrothermal minerals from sample QV16B has provided a plateau age of 7.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.70, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.10) for nine steps and 92.5% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age on ten points is 7.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.5) for an initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept of 303.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0Ma. Therefore, both ages coincide within the error. This sample has also provided a younger plagioclase plateau age of 1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.65\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.55, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.77), for seven steps and 87.7% of the 39Ar released. Due to the probable opening of the isotopic system during the alteration processes of the dacite, the plateau age obtained for the volcanic groundmass of 7.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 (Tortonian-Messinian boundary) can be an estimate for the age of the hydrothermal alteration.\nQV17 sample is a dacitic lava related to autoclastic facies of monomictic breccia, affected by a minor argillic alteration. It is located in the upper stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite, under the Azufre Andesite. A separate of the gray groundmass with hydrothermal minerals in the magnetic range of 0.2\u20130.5 A has provided a plateau age of 6.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.62, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.71) for seven steps and 88.3% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age for these seven points is 6.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.74), for a low initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034. Although both ages coincide within the error, the best estimate of age is 6.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0Ma, since the individual ages in the plateau were calculated with the initial Ar ratio obtained from the intersection of the inverse isochron.\nIn the same sample, a separate of the pink groundmass with hydrothermal phases in the magnetic range 0.5\u20131.0 A yielded a plateau age of 6.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.09, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.36) for five steps and 72.8% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The corresponding age obtained by the inverse isochron method for eight points and a low initial 40Ar-36Ar intercept at 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.9) is 6.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0Ma. This age is the best estimation for the sample, since the ages obtained in the plateau increments were calculated with the initial Ar relation obtained from the intersection of the inverse isochron. The four highest temperature increments provide an age by the inverse isochron method of 8.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.4), which suggests the existence of an older component in the volcanic groundmass and\/or mobility of Ar through the rock.\nAdditionally, the QV17 sample yielded a plateau age for plagioclase of 7.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.56\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.71, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.73), for 100% of the 39Ar released in twelve steps of the incremental heating (Fig. 10). The similar age obtained by the inverse isochron method in the five high-T increments is 7.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, for an initial ratio 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0296\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.23) close to the atmospheric value. Taken together, the Messinian ages obtained in the QV17 sample suggest a thermal resetting event, which reached temperatures higher than 150\u00a0\u00b0C and\/or an opening of the system during the hydrothermal alteration. Note that there are components in the groundmass of Tortonian age, similar to the extrusion ages obtained in other samples of the Quevar Dacite.\nQV19 sample consist of a dacitic lava, moderately replaced by silicic and advanced argillic alteration. It contains mineralization dispersed in the rocks and filling fracture planes. The sample was collected at the highest stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite. Biotite phenocrysts have provided a plateau age of 9.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.12, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.99) for nine steps and 90.5% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The inverse isochron age obtained for nine points is 9.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0Ma, for a40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 294\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.12), which is close to the atmospheric value. Therefore, both ages coincide within the error and account for the time of biotite crystallization by cooling during the magma extrusion in the Tortonian (late Miocene).\nA separate of the groundmass with hydrothermal minerals in the magnetic range of 0.5\u20131.0 A yielded a plateau age of 6.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.23, probability\u00a0=\u00a00.98) for eight steps and 89.6% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 10). The age in the same groundmass separate obtained by the inverse isochron method for 7 points and an 40Ar\/36Ar initial ratio of 293\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.10) is 6.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0Ma. This age is similar to those obtained in the pink groundmass of the QV17 sample. Analogously to this sample, the four highest temperature increments of the plateau provide an older age by the inverse isochron method of 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma, which also suggests the existence of an older component in the groundmass or the Ar mobility through the rock.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nRelationships between volcanic stratigraphy, hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization\nThe field data in the Quebrada Incahuasi indicate that, after the rhyolitic dome emplacement of the Rhyolites and Perlites unit, the dacites and andesites of the Quevar Dacite were erupted. The accumulation of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits gave rise to the building of a large strato-volcano, during the late Miocene evolutionary stage of the QVC in the Central Andean Volcanic Zone. The volcanic mineralogy, textures and structures of the Quevar Dacite were later modified by the superposition of an hydrothermal alteration. In the Quebrada Incahuasi, the map distribution of this hydrothermal alteration defines the steeply-dipping structural root of the lithocap, which follows an ENE-trending band that includes the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar mineral deposits (Fig. 3). Therefore, the upflow of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid from the deeper-seated source to the lithocap environment was structurally controlled by the ENE-trending fault zones. However, the lithocap is composed of a large sub-horizontal lenticular domain in excess of 1\u00a0km-thick, between the topographic heights of 4550\u00a0m (Vince deposit) and 5700\u00a0m (Cerro Azufre), extending laterally up to 10\u00a0km in the N and NE trends, along the Quebrada Toro Grande and Mamaturi (Marquetti et al., 2017). Therefore, the lateral outflow of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid occurred when the ascending fluid reached its neutral buoyancy level and encountered a permeable stratigraphic aquifer, as the poorly consolidated volcaniclastic breccias and tuffs of the Quevar Dacite.\nThe lithocap hosts the high-sulfidation epithermal mineralization (Robl et al., 2009), which appears forming (1) dykes, veins and\/or breccia cement and (2) more disseminated stratabound replacements. Mineralization in veins and breccia cements is mainly related to ENE-trending fault planes and sub-vertical fracture systems, located in the structural roots of the lithocap, as in the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits. Therefore, this style of mineralization had a clear structural control. Reactivation of veins as faults during episodic deformation can result in several stages of tectonic brecciation, mineralization disruption and new infill of the created open spaces. Mineralization by replacement is generally located at a higher topographic elevation in the QVC. It is volumetrically much more extensive and typically hosted as replacements in the residual quartz domains. The extent of this type of mineralization was probably controlled by the lateral flow of mineralizing fluids (Escuder-Viruete et al., 2021).\nThe coherent facies of the Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite unconformably overlap the Quevar Dacite, or hydrothermally altered rock equivalents. The field data imply: (a) an interruption of felsic volcanism; (b) the cessation of the hydrothermal alteration system and the high sulfidation mineralization; (c) the beginning of a stage of erosion of the volcanic edifice with the formation of a paleorelief; (d) the exposure of deep levels of the volcanic stratigraphy and lithocap that are brought close to the surface; and (e) a new reactivation of silicic magmatism in the QVC with the eruption of subaerial lavas. The erosion and formation of an erosive surface controlled the late gossan-type alteration, which has been preserved in the topographically higher sectors of the Quevar Dacite.\n\n\n6.2\nLate miocene structures in the Quebrada Incahuasi of the QVC\nIn the study area, the most prominent structure is the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro lineament, which both includes NW-trending segmented left-lateral strike-slip faults and broad bands of distributed shear deformation (Fig. 1). The lateral limits of the COT lineament are constituted by the Quevar and Chorrillos left-lateral strike-slip fault zones (Fig. 2; Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013). Both large-scale fault zones, together with other related lower-order structures, define a tectonic left-lateral strike-slip stepover at regional-scale (Seggiaro et al., 2016), which controlled the evolution of the Aguas Calientes caldera and the Quevar Volcanic Complex in the late Miocene, as well as the location of the mineralized veins in the Quevar and La Poma districts (Seggiaro et al., 2021). Thus, the main WNW-trending Quevar fault zone defines the southwestern boundary of the stepover. Internally, the stepover is divided by related subsidiary faults into smaller tectonic blocks.\nIn the Quebrada de Incahuasi, the geometric and kinematic analysis of faults carried out in this work indicates that the E to ENE-directed regional sub-horizontal shortening could have (re)activated the Quevar fault zone as a left-lateral strike-slip fault (Fig. 6). Angular relations between the main Quevar fault zone and ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults, suggest that these subsidiary faults correspond to synthetic R-type structures (sensu\nSchreurs, 2003) laterally connected to the Quevar master structure. Therefore, the Quevar fault zone accommodated only a portion of the far stress field, whereas the remained was transferred as a near-field stress to ENE to E-trending R-type faults and left-lateral strike-slip duplexes (sensu\nWoodcock and Fisher, 1986) at several scales. These R-type faults juxtapose zones with different degrees of alteration in the lithocap, as well as control the tectonic landscape of elongate valleys in the Quebrada Incahuasi. Although development of NNW to N-trending, right-lateral strike-slip faults is rather limited in the Quebrada Incahuasi, the general trend of these structures with respect to the orientation of the external stress field suggests that these correspond to antithetical R\u2032-type structures. Therefore, R and R\u2032-type structures were able to accommodate a part of the far stress field through the internal disruption of the stepover into small tectonic blocks and, probably, a minor contribution through rotation and\/or translation of such blocks.\nOn the other hand, the dykes and veins with epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization have a sub-vertical dip and a dominant ENE to NE trend, although in the Vince and Armonia deposits vein plane orientation ranges to a NNE strike (Fig. 8). Comparison between the orientation of the far stress field and the general trend of the mineralized structures suggests that they are favorably oriented T-type structures. This is consistent with the existence of open space fill textures in mineralized veins and associated fracture systems, opened by a NNW-trending orthogonal extension. In turn, the contact between the mineralized veins and the hosting altered dacite frequently exhibits a reactivation as a brittle fault (Fig. 9), in which the kinematic indicators in these planes establish both strike-slip and normal movements.\nIn summary, the epithermal mineralization in sub-vertical veins had a clear structural control, resulting from a general left-lateral strike-slip regimen, which gave rise to the opening of the ENE to NE-trending dykes and veins that channeled the mineralizing fluids. Furthermore, the different strike-slip fault sets distinguished in the Quebrada Incahuasi were also formed by a similar WNW-trending left-lateral strike-slip regime. Therefore, epithermal mineralization, associated hydrothermal alteration and strike-slip faulting are part of a progressive deformation, consequence of the regional stress field imposed by the E to ENE-directed convergence. On a larger scale, this progressive deformation was related to the formation of a left-lateral strike-slip stepover, produced between the Quevar and Chorrillos fault zones of the COT lineament (Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2016). The fault zones developed in Quebrada Incahuasi are thus integrated into the rhomboidally shaped stepover, or zone of slip transfer, between these overstepping and subparallel strike-slip faults.\nThe Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite are not hydrothermally altered and apparently only deformed by normal faults. Therefore, the eruption of these subaerial lavas marks cessation of hydrothermal activity and strike-slip motion along the COT, as well as the transition to an extensional or transtensive regional stress regime. This transition is documented by analyzing fault-slip data in the next section.\n\n\n6.3\nLate miocene tectonic stress regimes obtained from fault-slip data\nIn the Quebrada de Incahuasi, stress field solutions calculated from inversion of measured fault-slip data establish late Miocene strike-slip and extensional stress regimes, which are summarized in Fig. 9. Strike-slip stress regimes (\u03c32 disposed sub-vertical) obtained from strike-slip faults are characterized by ENE to NE-trending maximum horizontal stress (\u03c3H\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c31) and stress ratio values of 0.37\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a00.48 (Appendix C), that establish a pure strike-slip type of deformation. The ENE to NE-trending sub-horizontal shortening was oblique to the WNW-ESE trend of the Quevar and Chorrillos fault zones of the COT lineament (Acocella et al., 2011; Lanza et al., 2013; Seggiaro et al., 2016). This obliquity resulted in the partition of the deformation inside the rhomboidally shaped stepover located between them, producing a left-lateral slip in the WNW and ENE\/E faults (P and R-types) and a right-lateral slip in the NNW\/N faults (R\u2032-type).\nThe stress tensors obtained from the Bingham distribution of mineralized dykes and veins are characterized by the ENE to NE-trending of the maximum horizontal stress (\u03c31) and values of the stress ratio between 0.02\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a00.16 (a value equal to 0.47; Fig. 9). Therefore, the prevailing stress regime during the formation of the epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralizations was strike-slip\/compressional (R\u00a0<\u00a00.25; \u03c32\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c33). The \u03c31 trend is subparallel to that of the mineralized dykes and veins, so their opening as T-type structures could have taken place during this tectonic regime. The internal tectonic brecciation of the veins, with successive stages of cementation and mineralization of the resulting matrix, and the reactivation of the vein-wallrock contact as a strike-slip fault indicate that the strike-slip was coeval and subsequent to mineralization. Therefore, the obtained stress regimes support the interpretation that formation of mineralized veins, their subsequent reactivation as strike-slip faults and the formation of the different kinematic fault-sets are different stages of a progressive deformation under a similar strike-slip regime. The change from a strike-slip\/compression to a pure strike-slip regime, recorded by the R-value increase, is interpreted as related to a permutation (sensu\nPeacock et al., 2017b) of \u03c33 into \u03c32 vertical stress (Fig. 9).\nExtensional stress regimes (\u03c31 disposed sub-vertical) obtained from normal and oblique-normal faults are characterized by NNW to N-trending minimum horizontal stress (\u03c33) and stress ratio values of 0.27\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a00.47 (Appendix C), that establish a pure extension type of deformation (Fig. 9). Field crosscutting relationship and timing of fault movement indicate in several locations (as Armonia and Quespejahuar deposits) an initial left-lateral strike-slip movement along ENE to E-trending faults caused by the strike-slip regime, followed by a normal movement in the same fault surfaces triggered by the extensional regime (Fig. 9). The strike-slip regime prevails until the eruption of the Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite, which are only deformed by normal faults. Therefore, in Quebrada Incahuasi, the extensional regime replaces that of strike-slip, and it does so prior to the eruption of these units. The change from a pure strike-slip to a pure extensional was related to a permutation of the vertical stress from \u03c32 to \u03c31 (Fig. 9).\n\n\n6.4\nAge of the Quevar Dacite and hydrothermal alteration in the Quebrada Incauhasi\n\nFig. 11\n summarizes the 40Ar-39Ar geochronological results obtained for Quevar Dacite samples in the Quebrada Incahuasi of the QVC. The oldest obtained ages were in the biotite phenocrysts of the QV19 sample, which belongs to the highest stratigraphical levels of the unit that were apparently not affected by the hydrothermal alteration. This age is interpreted as that of biotite crystallization by cooling during the magma eruption in the Tortonian (late Miocene). The plateau and inverse isochron ages obtained for the rest of the biotites in rocks affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration (QV4 and QV10) are younger, although they were collected at lower levels of the volcanic sequence. These results suggest the existence of a Messinian age (latest Miocene) thermal event with isotopic resetting, which reached temperatures above the biotite closure temperature (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C) or, more likely, the opening of the system during hydrothermal alteration processes.\nHowever, the plagioclase phenocrysts from the QV4 sample have provided relatively older ages, similar within error to those obtained in the biotite phenocrysts from the QV19 sample. Therefore, this age also records the plagioclase crystallization by cooling during the magma eruption in the Tortonian. The rest of the plagioclase have provided younger plateau and inverse isochron ages. These ages were obtained in samples collected at the highest stratigraphic levels of the Quevar Dacite, which contain sulphide-mineralized veins and are variably affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration (QV16B and QV17). Therefore, these Messinian ages are related to a thermal resetting event, which reached T\u00a0>\u00a0150\u00a0\u00b0C (plagioclase closure temperature; Hodges, 2003) and\/or to a system opening during the hydrothermal alteration.\nSeparates from the volcanic groundmass have also provided relatively old plateau ages (QV4 and QV10), similar within error or slightly older than those obtained in part of the biotite and plagioclase phenocrysts. Although these samples are slightly affected by hydrothermal argillic alteration, they have preserved the primary isotopic values and the resulting age is interpreted as corresponding to the rapid cooling of the dacitic magma during the eruption. In favor of this interpretation is the inverse isochron age obtained in the four highest temperature increments for the pink groundmass in the QV17 sample, which suggests the existence of an older component in the volcanic groundmass. The rest of the plateau and inverse isochron ages obtained in the groundmass fall in the 7.46 to 6.32\u00a0Ma interval (latest Miocene). These relatively young ages were obtained in samples with veins and disseminated sulphide mineralization, as well as variably replaced by silicic and advanced argillic alteration (QV16B, QV17 and QV19). As in the case of the younger age group obtained in the biotite and plagioclase phenocrysts, these ages record the opening of the isotopic system during the hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization processes in the Quevar Dacite.\n\n\n6.5\nLate miocene evolution of the QVC\nIn this section, a structural evolutive model is proposed that integrates all data obtained in the Quebrada de Incahuasi of the Quevar Volcanic Complex. This model allows establishing the relationships between dacitic volcanism, hydrothermal alteration, epithermal mineralizations and coeval deformation. The model comprises three main stages schematically shown in Fig. 12\n.\nThe first stage included the eruption of the Quevar Dacite in the Tortonian (9.9\u20138.7\u00a0Ma) over the Aguas Calientes caldera ignimbrites (10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma), within the evolutionary context of the Quevar Volcanic Complex. The construction of the volcanic complex took place through the accumulation of lavas and pyroclastic deposits, together with the syn-volcanic intrusion of subaerial felsic domes and\/or crypto domes (Fig. 12a). The coherent facies consisted of dacitic and subordinately andesitic and riodacitic lavas, as well as autoclastic rim facies, and the pyroclastic facies included proximal monomictic block and ash flows deposits, and distal scoria and ash flow deposits. The regional WNW to NW alignment of the contemporary Rinc\u00f3n, Tul-Tul, Del Medio, Quevar and Azufrero volcanoes indicates a control of the COT lineament in the volcanic activity during this stage.\nThe second stage included the implantation of an extensive hydrothermal alteration system in the Quevar Dacite and the related formation of the epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in the Messinian (7.7\u20136.3\u00a0Ma). The geometric and kinematic characteristics of the mineralized dykes and veins, the mineralized breccia zones and the related hydrothermal alteration (silicic, advanced argillic, argillic), indicate that the alteration and mineralization processes took place during a regional strike-slip deformation. This deformation was related to ENE to E-directed sub-horizontal shortening induced by Cenozoic regional convergence and the (re)activation of the Quevar fault system of the COT, which formed a large-scale left-lateral strike-slip stepover between WNW-trending regional faults (Fig. 12b). In the Quebrada Incahuasi, the internal deformation in the stepover produced mainly synthetic ENE to E-trending left-lateral strike-slip faults (R) and NNW to N-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults (R\u2032), as well as the opening of ENE-trending planes (T) that host most of the mineralized dykes and veins. The main mineral deposits are included in an ENE-directed band that probably channeled the ascent of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluids.\nThe third stage included the erosion of the volcanic edifice and the lithocap, as well as the mobilization of chemical elements in relation to a supergenic alteration (gossan). The hydrothermal system ceased its activity prior to the eruption of the unaltered Azufre Andesite and Cumbres Dacite. In Quebrada Incahuasi, the kinematics of the brittle reactivation of mineralized veins and ENE-trending strike-slip faults indicate the subsequent implantation of a NNW-directed extensional regime. In this sector, ENE to E and WNW-trending extensional faults control the morphology and the incision of the drainage network.\nThe tectonic stress evolution of the QVC included a first regime of strike-slip\/compression to a pure strike-slip, which was followed by a regime of pure extension. The successive changes in the stress regime were related to a permutation of \u03c33 into \u03c32 and after \u03c32 into \u03c31 vertical stress. The timing for the orogen-normal strike-slip stress regime ranges between \u223c10 and 6.5\u00a0Ma and the orogen-parallel extensional stress regime started in the latest Miocene (<6.5\u00a0Ma). This evolution of the regional stress regime during the Cenozoic is similar to that previously described in various sectors of the Antiplano-Puna plateau, Western Cordillera and along the Andes of southern and central Peru (S\u00e9brier et al., 1988; Marrett et al., 1994; Cladouhos et al., 1994; Marrett and Strecker, 2000; Elger et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2013; Daxberger and Riller, 2015; Giambiagi et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nIn the Quebrada Incahuasi of the QVC, the epithermal Ag\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in sub-vertical dykes and veins of the Vince, Armon\u00eda and Quespejahuar deposits, associated hydrothermal alteration and strike-slip faulting are part of a progressive deformation, consequence of the regional stress field imposed by the E to ENE-directed convergence. This progressive deformation was related to the formation of a left-lateral strike-slip stepover between the Quevar and Chorrillos fault zones of the COT lineament.\nThere are two age groups in the Quevar Dacite: (1) ages between 9.9 and 8.7\u00a0Ma (Tortonian) for syn-volcanic processes such as crystallization of phenocrysts and rapid cooling of the groundmass; and (2) ages between 7.7 and 6.3\u00a0Ma (Messinian) for post-volcanic processes that imply mobility of Ar through the rock produced by the opening of the system and\/or thermal events with isotopic resetting at temperatures higher than the closing of each mineral. Therefore, the first group dates the time interval of Quevar Dacite eruption and the second group the hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization.\nThe evolution of the stress regime recorded in the QVC during the Cenozoic has been interpreted regionally in terms of two main geodynamic phases: (1) an orogenic constructional phase, older than late Miocene, and (2) a gravitational collapse phase, active from late Miocene to present. The discussion of possible causes for the stress regime change in the northern Puna plateau exceeds the objectives of this work, focused on a sector of the QVC. However, this work documents how the transition from a strike-slip to an extensional regime led to an important hydrothermal alteration and epithermal mineralization in Quebrada de Incahuasi, as well as other coeval mineralizations described in the northern Puna, which illustrate why structural geology is critical to finding, evaluating and mining ore deposits.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nJavier Escuder Viruete: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing- Original draft preparation, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Eduardo A.

The development of crustal faults also provides insights into plate boundary interaction and crustal deformation processes past and present. Although faults and associated fracture zones have been studied for several decades, the absolute timing of fault slip and fracture formation has in general remained a poorly constrained parameter. Indirect dating methods include using the timing of uplift using thermochronology (e.g. Brichau et al., 2006), exposure dating of geomorphological features (e.g. Brown et al., 2002), and dating of structures offset by displacement (e.g. Searle et al., 2010). Direct dating of ductile deformation (shear) zones is potentially more straightforward as it can utilise the growth\/overgrowth or isotopic resetting of moderate to high temperature minerals (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) such as mica, zircon, monazite and titanite, to infer when shearing was active (e.g. Mottram et al., 2015; Viola et al., 2016). Beyond the timescales of surface exposure dating, the direct dating of faults in the brittle regime requires the presence of mineralization formed during or shortly after slip, either in gouge, veins or along fault surfaces (e.g. Eyal et al., 1992; van der Pluijm et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2015; Dichiarante et al., 2016). One of the most widespread syn-tectonic upper crustal mineral precipitates is calcite, commonly occurring along shear fractures or faults as slickenfibres and in fault-related opening-mode fractures as veins. If calcite can be reliably dated, and can be shown to have grown at the time of fault-slip and\/or regional deformation events, then it offers a method that has wide applicability across many upper crustal deformation zones.\nHere, we present a summary of recent progress in calcite geochronology applied to upper crustal faults that has seen a rapid adoption of this method, and show that this is opening new avenues of investigation in structural geology. We focus our attention here on fault-related structures, rather than opening-mode fractures (or veins) in general. Although not specifically covering geochronology, the review of Laubach et al. (2019) provides an excellent synopsis of opening-mode fracture cements and fills which should also be used as a reference source for calcite cement dating studies in general. With regard to fold-related structures, Lacombe et al. (2021) also provide detail on several associated mineralization structure types than can potentially be dated using calcite fills. Here, we discuss the importance of linking the dating of mineralization to fault movement and fracture opening, which represents a critical, but currently somewhat underdeveloped keystone of this geochronological application.\n\n\n2\nThe calcite chronometer\nCalcite (CaCO3), a trigonal mineral, and the most stable form of calcium carbonate, is commonly found precipitated within opening mode fractures and along fault planes in a wide variety of host lithologies and tectonic settings. These are commonly termed \u2018veins\u2019, but as Gale et al. (2014) point out, the term is used somewhat inconsistently. Calcite incorporates various metals at the trace level which can act as potential radioisotopic chronometers (Jahn and Cuvellier, 1994; Rasbury et al., 2009). Most commonly utilised is uranium, which can be dated through decay to its final daughter product, lead (U-Pb geochronology) or via decay to its intermediate daughter products 234U and 230Th (U-Th geochronology). U-Th geochronology is applicable over timeframes ranging from several years to around 600,000 ka (Edwards et al., 1987; Williams et al., 2017), although it requires very high analytical precision at the older end of this age range. U-Pb geochronology is theoretically applicable across the entire geological timescale, but is most commonly used beyond the realm of U-Th dating at > 1\u00a0Ma, and within the Phanerozoic eon (Roberts et al., 2020). The Sm-Nd isotopic system has been utilised in several past studies, mostly for hydrothermal carbonates in economic mineral deposits (e.g. Peng et al., 2003; Uysal et al., 2007; Barker et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2020). Other possible systems in carbonate minerals include Rb-Sr and Lu-Hf (Maas et al., 2021); we will return to these in a later section.\nEach radioisotopic system has benefits and limitations. With the exception of U-Pb, all other methods are traditionally achieved through micro-drilling aliquots of the sample, followed by chemical dissolution and chromatography to separate parent and daughter isotopes. This is than followed by analysis with either Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). The spatial resolution of the micro-drilling sampling can be as fine as <100\u00a0\u03bcm; however, depending on the technique used for measurement and concentration of the isotopes, the volume needed can be considerable (>5\u00a0mm3). Given that hydrothermal calcite is commonly zoned at a very fine scale (e.g. Roberts et al., 2020a), these methods can potentially average out several generations of calcite growth. More recently, the in-situ technique, laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) has been developed for U-Pb in calcite (Li et al., 2014; Ring and Gerdes, 2016; Roberts et al., 2017). Although LA-ICP-MS can also be applied to U-Th dating (Eggins et al., 2005), the method has large uncertainties and requires relatively high U contents compared to that of U-Pb. Use of the LA-ICP-MS technique means that ablation spots on the order of 50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm can be accurately placed within single growth phases and combined to calculate a single date. The benefits and applications of LA-ICP-MS to U-Pb dating of carbonate phases have been extensively reviewed in recent publications (e.g. Woodhead and Petrus, 2019; Roberts et al., 2020a; Kylander-Clark et al., 2020; Guillong et al., 2020; Elisha et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nCalcite as a syn-kinematic mineral associated with faults\nCalcite precipitates within fault zones along individual fault and fracture planes, forming mineral fills and cements that can be discrete or continuous at the outcrop scale. The types and origin of fault-related calcite fills have been reviewed extensively in the literature, e.g. Bons et al. (2012), Gale et al. (2014), Ukar and Laubach (2016) and Laubach et al. (2019) for recent summaries, along with Ramsay et al. (1983), Passchier and Trouw (2005) and Fossen (2016) for relevant book chapters. A key premise of using calcite fill to date the timing of fault slip, is that the dated mineral growth occurred either during fault slip or associated fracture opening, or, shortly thereafter. The notion of \u2018shortly thereafter\u2019 in this context, being that the duration between fault slip and calcite precipitation is smaller than the uncertainties of the dating method. This premise is complicated by the fact that: (1) faults will often be composed of many incremental phases of slip over hundreds to millions of years (e.g. Fossen 2016); and (2) some cements and fills may potentially result from localised chemical diffusional processes that are unrelated to faulting (e.g. Wiltschko and Morse, 2001). A second premise, is that the calcite fill, and in particular, the dated isotopic system, has remained undisturbed by later structural or fluid-related activity (Roberts et al., 2021).\n\nFig. 1\n highlights several common field occurrences of calcite precipitated as a consequence of fracture opening associated with faulting, i.e. the fractures either lie along a fault zone or occur in its associated damage zone. These include: slickenfibres grown along a fault plane with a clear lineation azimuth (Fig. 1a); calcite fills occurring in extensional jogs along a fault plane that exhibits a lineation (Fig. 1b) and multiple phases of deformation (Fig. 1c); calcite fill in a planar opening-mode fracture with no shear displacement (Fig. 1d); a swarm of sub-parallel contemporaneous calcite fills in opening-mode fractures (Fig. 1e); fracture-fill cements that have hosted open fluid-filled space leading to vuggy crystal growth (Fig. 1f); en-echelon fractures filled with calcite formed in association with a fault plane with a sense of shear (e.g. \u2018wing cracks\u2019 Fig. 1g); a cemented fault breccia (Fig. 1h); and an example of a cone-in-cone structure in calcite that is spatially associated with a fault plane (Fig. 1i).\nThe ability to link calcite mineralization to fault kinematics and associated fracturing processes is dependent on its origin and morphology; critically, this requires an understanding of the microstructure and textures of calcite fills, and can be assisted with the addition of geochemical and compositional information. Fig. 2\n schematically shows several types of fracture morphologies that can be cemented with calcite, whilst Fig. 3\n shows a range of natural examples viewed in thin section. The fill types and textures shown here are not exhaustive, but include some of those commonly used to directly infer the timing of fault slip and associated fracture opening relative to calcite precipitation (e.g. Roberts and Walker, 2016; Nuriel et al., 2012a, 2017, 2019; Oren et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020b; Miranda et al., 2020; Cruset et al., 2020). The purpose here is not to discriminate the only fill morphologies that can be used for geochronology, but to demonstrate that some examples of calcite mineralization can be more confidently linked to fault slip and associated fracturing than others. The cemented fractures shown in Fig. 2 have varying ability to be confidently linked to both the timing and kinematics of fault slip, and are drawn so that those on the left are easiest to unequivocally link to fault slip, whilst those on the right are less reliable. We also highlight common growth morphologies in calcite associated with these vein types. The terminology is purposely restricted to syntaxial and antitaxial to describe growth from the host rock towards the centre of the open void (syntaxial), and from a nucleation point within the void or vein towards the host rock (antitaxial); stretching fibres may exist with both of these opposing growth structures, and various other terms are in use in the literature (see Bons et al., 2012).\nSlickenfibres (Type I in Figs. 2 and 3a and b), although a sometimes-misplaced term (in terms of being used more broadly for calcite fault plane precipitation), are generally one of the most desirable forms of fault precipitates in that it provides clear kinematic information such as the azimuth of slip and in many cases the sense of shear. Slickenfibre calcite is a form of fracture-filling cement that fills an extensional jog space that is created in incremental steps (Bons et al., 2012); these are often on a scale that is not discernible to the naked eye, but are clearly seen in thin section. The example of Type II (Figs. 2 and 3a) is a larger pull-apart void space \u2013 or jog - that is mineralized during each phase of fault slip, i.e. precipitation is occurring synchronous with movement along the slip plane, as with slickenfibres. Opening mode tensile and hybrid (shear) veins (Type III) may form adjacent to major fault planes, or along minor fractures within fault damage zones. In such cases, it is important to establish the relative timing and kinematic links between fracture-sets and fault displacements where the relationships are evident. For example, it can be demonstrated that vein geometries and opening directions are consistent with the sense of displacement along nearby faults (e.g. Fig. 3a, b, d).\nThe aforementioned varieties all commonly exhibit crack-seal inclusion trails (e.g. Fig. 3b and c) left behind when a fracture opens due to displacement, and is then subsequently sealed by mineralization (Ramsay 1980). Petit et al. (1999) introduced the term \u2018crack-seal-slip\u2019, which is appropriate here, because there is commonly a cyclicity of fault slip along individual fault planes that leads to multiple phases of cracking and sealing. The crack-seal concept has been addressed in a number of studies investigating the role of stress release, dilation rate, fluid pressure and host rock strength, amongst other factors, on the formation of these cement types (Gaviglio, 1986; Lee and Wiltschko, 2000; Hilgers & Urai, 2005; Renard et al., 2005; and Holland & Urai, 2010). Crack-seal-slip cemented fractures along faults commonly display curved or inclined fibrous\/elongate mineral growth leading to the development of \u2018slickenfibre steps\u2019, which can be used to infer the sense of shear (e.g. Passchier and Trouw 2005). Because such mineral growth forms synchronously with displacement along shear fractures, these types are desirable for confidently linking dated mineral growth to fault slip.\nCalcite precipitate Types IV and V may also form from a process akin to \u2018cracking\u2019 and \u2018sealing\u2019, but are single phase, i.e. crack-seal but not crack-seal-slip. This does not mean that the associated host fault only had one phase of slip however, as subsequent slip may have been accommodated along adjacent or nearby fractures (i.e. crack-jump; Caputo and Hancock, 1998). Wall rock clasts in fault-related breccias and gouges (e.g. Type IV) may display overgrowths of calcite \u2013 so called strain shadows (see Passchier and Trouw 2005 for a review) \u2013 that are also arranged in an orientation consistent with the sense of fault slip (e.g. Fig. 3e).\nThe last precipitate (Type VI), is associated with the development of vuggy textures (e.g. Fig. 3f and g) and is potentially the least reliable in terms of providing robust timing constraints on fault slip. This is because the time gap between fault slip and precipitation into an open fracture void may be prolonged and could be much greater than the uncertainty of the dating method (Becker et al., 2010; Fall et al., 2012; Nuriel et al., 2012b). The vugs may remain open to the present day or become occluded by later calcite or other minerals. In many examples the calcite may display complex zoning, rind development, bridging structures (single bridge shown in Fig. 2) and even cockade textures consistent with repeated episodes of mineral precipitation and fluid flow (e.g. Fig. 3f; Laubach 2003, Frenzel and Woodcock 2014; Lander and Laubach, 2015). Dates of Type VI can provide minimum dates of fault slip (e.g. Roberts et al., 2020b), but they may also be used to determine the timing of other processes such as the timing of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation (e.g. Fig. 3g; Drake et al., 2019; Holdsworth et al., 2019, 2020). Fault-related open fracture systems of this kind commonly contain sediment fills when formed close to the surface (e.g. Wright et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2011; Holdsworth et al., 2019) and dating of calcite precipitates in such cases may help to constrain the timing of both faulting and regional exhumation (Fig. 3h; Roberts et al., 2020b).\nIt is clear therefore that, despite the many complexities of natural fault-associated fracture fills, one can usually distinguish pre-, syn- and post-kinematic calcite and other mineralization using careful field observation and petrographic analysis. It is also notable that calcite mineralization shows a remarkably high survival rate following brittle deformation and cataclasis and that even post-kinematic fills are useful as they provide a minimum age for fracture opening. We suggest that fault hosted crack-seal-slip mineral fills are the most desirable for direct dating methods, and are the most reliably identifiable as syn-kinematic; we provide three reasons for our suggestion: (1) they record the direction of slip via mineral growth; (2) individual slip phases can be identified and dated; and (3) they preserve evidence of incremental growth that is unlikely to be preserved should phases of post-faulting fluid-flow and calcite reprecipitation occur. In addition, crack-seal-slip veins often host fluid inclusions which are useful for determining the composition and temperature of fluids at the time of faulting (e.g. Bons et al., 2012). This then allows linking of fracture fill temperatures to burial history curves (e.g. Becker et al., 2010; Fall et al., 2012, 2016; Laubach et al., 2016). In contrast, it is theoretically possible to overprint simple single-stage veins, breccia cements or crack-fill veins during later phases of fluid-flow, therefore these may be harder to unambiguously link to fault slip. Regarding crystal morphology, although blocky calcite may form as a response to precipitation during fracture opening (Ankit et al., 2013; Spru\u017eeniece et al., 2021), it is potentially harder to distinguish from later phases of fluid-flow and vein overprinting than fibrous or elongate growth types.\nThe above discussion focuses on fault plane precipitation; however, there are other means to use calcite to date fault activity. Notably, through the use of calcite precipitation that occurs due to enhanced fluid-flow during episodes of crustal deformation and hydrothermal mineralization in near surface settings. These most commonly occur in certain regions where geological conditions are ideal, i.e. areas with carbonate-rich lithologies, and hydrothermal fluid circulation. The various forms of these carbonate precipitates, most commonly referred to as travertines, have been used extensively in areas such as Turkey to understand neotectonics (e.g. Temiz et al., 2009, 2013). Brogi et al. (2021) recently reviewed this field of travitonics. Some of the dated structures can be classed as opening-mode (tensile) veins (e.g. Uysal et al., 2011), and can be linked to local fault displacements. Other features are linked to underlying faults through their morphology, such as fissure ridges. In the latter case, the kinematic link is somewhat limited since it is difficult to link calcite precipitation to exact episodes of fault displacement. Also noteworthy is that the same premise has been used for dating of neotectonic activity offshore within continental margins, where carbonate precipitating at methane seeps has been linked to fault reactivation driven by glacial tectonics (e.g. Himmler et al., 2019).\n\n\n4\nChronology within context\nFollowing the arguments outlined above, detailed structural characterisation of dated material is necessary to make the links between timing of crystal growth and fault slip\/fracture opening (Nuriel et al., 2012a, 2012b; Craddock et al., 2021). It is also necessary to elucidate whether primary crystal growth has been preserved, or obliterated by secondary reprecipitation and\/or alteration due to later fluid activity; a process that is entirely permissible, even for calcite slickenfibres (Roberts et al., 2021). There are a range of imaging techniques available for micro-structural and compositional characterisation of calcite. Collectively, Rasbury et al. (2021) and Roberts et al. (2020a) provide a synopsis of these with examples for different carbonate occurrences. Although advanced analytical techniques can provide intricate detail on elemental composition, such as U zonation using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, some of the more readily available methods are the most useful for structural characterisation at the sample scale. Standard microscopy using transmitted and reflected light on well-polished surfaces can provide excellent detail of crystal morphology and the structural relations between growth phases (e.g. see Fig. 3), as well as detail on inclusions. Using microscopy on orientated samples, the twinning of calcite within and across a sample can be described; calcite twinning can be used an indicator of strain direction, intensity and temperature of deformation (e.g. Rowe and Rutter, 1990; Ferrill et al., 2004; Van der Pluijm et al., 1997). Cathodoluminescence (CL) provides some of the highest resolution levels of elemental zonation, and can be conducted using an SEM, or desktop microscope fitted with a CL detector and vacuum stage. CL remains one of the most common methods for carbonate petrography and microstructure. Elemental mapping using LA-ICP-MS provides compositional information at a useful scale for in-situ geochronology, and reveals detailed compositional variation of elements beyond the detection limits of SEM-based techniques. Information from elemental maps can also be easily correlated with isotopic age information, improving the ability to objectively interpret the resulting data (Drost et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2020a; Simpson et al., 2021b). Electron back-scatter detection (EBSD) is a less common technique currently for calcite, but can be used to assist with characterisation of calcite growth and deformation structures (Elisha et al., 2021).\nThe scale of in-situ analyses (typically 50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm spots), means that precise location of sample analyses can be achieved with respect to structural and compositional domains. The scale of complexity within calcite fills should not be underestimated however. To demonstrate this, Fig. 4\n shows an example of a complex calcite vein with structural domains narrower than 100\u00a0\u03bcm. The sample comes from a bedding-parallel fracture fill hosted in the Jurassic Whitby Mudstone Formation at Staithes in N England. Minor truncation of bedding laminations is seen in the field images, but the vein extends for over 400\u00a0m broadly parallel to the bedding. The CL image shows that at least three different gross structures can be discerned, with syntaxial growth zoning at the upper level, and repeated bands of bladed and fibrous calcite. The latter are inclined, indicating the direction of oblique opening and therefore a component of shear displacement across the fracture. A stylolite indicates dissolution due to vertical\/sub-vertical shortening. This example demonstrates that precise placement of ablation spots, or micro-drilled domains, is required to sample individual structural domains and potentially date different stages in the filling and associated fault movement history.\n\n\n5\nFaulting and calcite precipitation timescales\nAn important concern in the application of calcite geochronology to fault timescales is the duration of time between fault slip (and associated fracture opening) and calcite precipitation. The rates of calcite precipitation and of fracture sealing are also an important consideration in understanding rock strength and permeability in the sub-surface; e.g. because sealed mineral fills can be stronger than the host rock (Caputo and Hancock, 1998). To date, Williams et al. (2019) is the only study which has been carried out with the sole intention of providing accurate constraints on calcite growth rates using absolute geochronology. U-Th dates from the centre and edge of several vein samples provided rates between ca. 0.05\u20130.8 mm\/ka. Several other previous studies exist where multiple dates across single fracture fills have been measured, which can be used to estimate growth rates. Based on continuous precipitation of a coseismic travertine sample 20\u00a0cm wide that yields a span of ages over 400 ka, a 0.5\u00a0mm\/year growth rate can be inferred (Uysal et al., 2007; Karabacak et al., 2019). Karaback et al. (2019) dated the centre and rim of several travertine-type deposits with U-Th, yielding growth rates between 0.1 and 0.11\u00a0mm\/yrs. Observations of calcite precipitation in modern environments reveal even shorter time-frames. For example, Tulloch (1982) observed growth of platy calcite crystals in a geothermal well of 0.1\u00a0mm\/day. Such platy (or bladed) crystals occur typically in natural geothermal fractures with high fluid temperatures (McNamara et al., 2016).\nEstimates of fracture fill sealing rates can be determined empirically, using the premise that where resolvable ages of fault recurrence can be demonstrated, the sealing rate is likely to be much faster than the measured recurrence rate. At the coarser end of the scale, Craddock et al. (2021) resolved several distinct phases of faulting within a single fracture fill sample from the Gishron Fault, part of the Dead Sea fault zone. Based on the ability to resolve different generations of faulting using multiple ages, it can be inferred that the sealing time of each crack-seal phase was less than the recurrence time of ca. 2 million years. The ages of this single fracture fill overlap those from across the region (Nuriel et al., 2017), indicating that detailed chronologies of single fills can record protracted regional deformation. At a finer scale, Williams et al. (2017) demonstrated a recurrence interval of the Loma Blanca fault using U-Th geochronology of 40\u201350 ka.\nGrowth rates of calcite fracture fills and veins have also been modelled both experimentally and numerically. Experimental models suggest that solute (i.e. Ca) saturation and volume of the fluid control the rate of precipitation, and that filling of natural fracture fills may take thousands to millions of years (e.g. Lee et al., 1996; Lee and Morse, 1999); however, these types of growth models may be overly simplistic compared to nature, and thus the rates may not be directly applicable (Hilgers and Urai, 2002). Numerical modelling of fracture-fill mechanisms have become more complex over time (e.g. Hilgers et al., 2001, 2004; Nollet et al., 2005; Ankit et al., 2015; Prajapati et al., 2018; Sp\u00e4th et al., 2021; Spru\u017eeniece et al., 2021), but the scaling of these experimental rates to natural examples is uncertain. It is clear from the previous studies utilising absolute chronology summarized above that rates of crystal growth and vein sealing probably have a high variability in relation to availability, composition and temperature of fluids (e.g. Williams et al., 2019), and this will vary, potentially by orders of magnitude, across individual fault strands, damage zones and fault systems. With regard to the application of directly dating faulting, the key issue is knowing what the rates are likely to be within \u2018normal\u2019 upper crustal fault systems. Importantly it seems that the precipitation and sealing rates observed in these empirical studies, indicate that fracture fill\/vein sealing generally occurs on much shorter timescales than those of the current dating methods. This validates the use of these methods for constraining fault slip chronologies.\n\n5.1\nCase studies \u2013 individual fault histories\nSeveral studies have used calcite geochronology to investigate the timescales of individual fault strands (Fig. 5\n). Craddock et al. (2021) document a single mineralized fill sample from a strand of the Gishron Fault that exhibits normal and sinistral strike-slip offsets within the Dead Sea region. They obtained nine reliable ages, which clustered into five periods of faulting spanning ca. 20 to 13\u00a0Ma, each of which is associated with a change in the recorded direction of strain across the fault as determined through calcite twinning analysis. Williams et al. (2017) presented twenty reliable U-Th dates from the Loma Blanca normal fault in the Rio Grande rift, spanning several individual fracture fill samples. Their dates range from ca. 575 to 150 ka and, as highlighted above, can be used to demonstrate a recurrence interval of some 40 to 50 ka. The Dead Sea Fault Zone has been dated in several studies using both U-Th and U-Pb. Nuriel et al. (2012a and 2012b) dated several samples from a single quarry, close to the Hula Western Border Fault, which exposes several sinistral strike-slip fault planes. One sample has U-Th dates ranging from 237 to 28 ka, with another ranging from 159 to 61 ka. Uysal et al. (2011) dated a 3\u00a0cm wide banded calcite opening-mode vein taken from a normal fault in a tectonically active area of SW Turkey. Twenty dates across this single vein range from 23.9 to 11.8 ka. These studies indicate prolonged activity across individual fault strands on the order of thousands of years to 10s of ka.\n\n\n5.2\nCase studies - regional fault histories\nAnalysing regional fault histories with U-Pb has become the most common use of absolute chronology to faulting timescales, and has been applied to a wide variety of geodynamic settings (Fig. 6\n). Roberts and Walker (2016) dated several conjugate normal, strike-slip and oblique-slip fault strands that dissect the Faroe Islands using calcite precipitates occurring as filled extensional jogs and implosion breccias. The structures themselves were previously linked into a multi-phase kinematic framework of deformation that occurred as the North Atlantic Ocean opened (Walker et al., 2012). The dates (45\u201311\u00a0Ma) are younger than the widely accepted age for the onset of rifting (ca. 55 Ma), demonstrating that deformation associated with this rifted continental margin was protracted and outlasted the propagation of the oceanic spreading centre.\nFar-field and intraplate deformation has been dated in several studies. Goodfellow et al. (2017) dated slickenfibres precipitated on brittle strike-slip fault planes exposed in SE Sweden. Although complex age systematics were obtained, the authors unpicked ages of movement of 65 and 55\u00a0Ma, which they loosely tied to the far-field effects of Alpine convergence to the south. Roberts et al. (2020b) dated calcite fills associated with the final phase of normal fault movements along the Flamborough Head fault zone in NE England in an area where previous structural work had proposed a complex kinematic evolution with multiple reactivation events due to Alpine and other inversion events (e.g. Starmer, 1995). A cluster of dates ca. 65-56\u00a0Ma from a normal fault breccia cement and adjacent opening-mode veins, indicate that the normal faulting and earlier deformation occurred in the late Cretaceous. This means that all of the Flamborough Head fault zone movements onshore were unlikely to be related to Alpine or Pyrenean inversion. The dated deformation and associated calcite mineralization does, however, overlap the North Atlantic hotspot uplift and regional tilting of Britain.\nAs far as collisional orogens go, the timing of deformation within the European Alps is receiving considerable attention using calcite geochronology. Sinistral transtensional deformation, accommodated by both normal and dip-slip movement along faults bounding the Alpenrhein Graben in the Central Alps, was dated using slickenfibre calcite at 25 to 22\u00a0Ma by Ring and Gerdes (2016). The authors interpret this deformation as forming due to E-W extension in the Oligocene related to localised tangential stretching induced by subduction and convergence geodynamics along the Alpine belt. The Jura mountains represent a foreland fold and thrust belt in the northwest of the Alpine orogen, that exhibits detachment faulting along evaporite layers (e.g. Sommaruga, 1999). Looser et al. (2021) dated thrust faults within the Jura that were active during the foreland propagation of this belt, with one thrust being active at ca. 15 to 9\u00a0Ma, and another as young as 4.5\u00a0Ma. The Penninic Frontal Thrust represents a boundary in which \u2018internal\u2019 high-grade metamorphic units were thrust over less metamorphosed \u2018external\u2019 units of the Alpine belt; this thrust zone was then reactivated as an extensional fault during the late stages of the orogen (e.g. Sue and Tricart, 2003). Bilau et al. (2020) date the onset of this extensional reactivation through calcite veining and cementation of cataclasite to at least ca. 3.5\u00a0Ma, with a separate phase of reactivation occurring at ca. 2.5\u00a0Ma.\nVarious strike-slip and transform fault systems have been dated, some with large sampling campaigns. The Big Creek Fault is a large (>150\u00a0km) strike-slip fault within the Canadian Cordillera. Mottram et al. (2020) dated calcite that yielded two ages of fault movement, at ca. 73 and 60-57\u00a0Ma. Notably, they also utilised K-Ar illite dating to compare with the calcite chronology, and both methods yielded overlapping age constraints for fault activity. The Dead Sea Fault Zone is an active transform plate boundary between the Arabian and Sinai tectonic plates. Nuriel et al. (2017) dated onset of strike-slip fault activity through calcite fault precipitates to ca. 21 Ma in the southern Elat region, and ca. 17 Ma in the northern Hermon region. Oren et al. (2020) expanded upon this study, providing strike-slip fault activity constraints of 18 to 10\u00a0Ma, peaking at 14\u00a0Ma, indicating that faulting likely propagated from south to north. The Sinai-Negev Shear Zone is an E-W trending strike-slip fault slip that interacts with the Dead Sea Fault Zone at its eastern boundary. Weinberger et al. (2020) demonstrated that faulting here was initiated as early as ca. 73 Ma, with the main phase beginning at 27 to 22\u00a0Ma, and activity continued until at least 10\u00a0Ma, as constrained by the youngest U-Pb calcite date obtained. The North Anatolian Fault Zone is another seismically active strike-slip dominated region within the eastern Eurasian margin. Nuriel et al. (2019) dated part of the fault zone that was active as an extensional normal fault at 42\u00a0Ma, and showed that reactivation as a dextral fault zone occurred at ca. 11 Ma. Calcite sampling and dating campaigns of this nature are throwing additional insight to the interaction of plate boundaries and the resultant duration of activity along individual fault strands.\n\n\n\n6\nLimitations\nThere are several important limitations to the application of absolute geochronology methods to fault timescales, some that are general, and some specific to the isotope system. A general limitation is the ability to confidently link measured calcite dates with specific fault activity, and to provide robust evidence that the dated material represents primary calcite growth, and not later thermal or fluid-related activity. As discussed above, alleviating this limitation requires a combination of geochemical, compositional and microstructural characterisation (e.g. Figs. 1\u20134).\nThe usefulness of a date depends in part upon its age precision. For U-Pb dating, the individual uncertainties are often large spanning several million years or more. However, applying the method to areas where the timing of faulting is inferred based on cross-cutting relations, and often limited to periods of time such as \u2018Alpine\u2019 or \u2018Laramide\u2019, means that any new absolute age constraints still represent significant advances in our knowledge of regional timings (e.g. Parrish et al., 2018; Holdsworth et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020b).\nIn order to improve the precision of the in situ U-Pb carbonate method, more homogeneous reference materials will be required (in terms of their measured age), as the commonly used reference material (WC1; Roberts et al., 2017) imparts a >2.5% limit with which we can interpret any one age. The recently characterised material ASH15D presents a suitable candidate with an age uncertainty of only 0.4% (Nuriel et al., 2021), although its low concentration of radiogenic lead make it really only suitable for multi-collector instrumentation.\nAn important limitation to all radioisotopic methods, is having measurable quantities of the parent and daughter isotopes. For U-Pb, low uranium is a common and unpredictable issue in particular for fracture-filling calcite, as is a high abundance of common lead, which can swamp any measurement of radiogenic lead (Roberts et al., 2020a). At present, there are no known ways to easily screen samples to pick those most suitable for U-Pb dating, as U and Pb incorporation are compounded by a multitude of factors during calcite precipitation (Rasbury et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2020). Widespread interest in this method hopefully means this will not always be the case. A further limitation of U-Pb dating, is the potential disequilibrium of intermediate daughter products, which can significantly impact the accuracy of very young (<5\u00a0Ma) samples (see Roberts et al., 2020a).\nFor the U-Th method, similar problems of low U and high Th compound the measurement and obtainable precision. For isochron methods, such as Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and Lu-Hf, age precision will in part be limited by the spread in initial parent-daughter isotope compositions, with a low spread in parent isotope abundance across the measured sample region leading to a lower precision isochron. The literature data on incorporation of these elements into calcite is sparse, but over time it is hoped that selection of suitable materials for each of these isotopic systems will become feasible. As all of these techniques develop over the next few years, it is likely that \u2018best practise\u2019 and knowledge about the most efficient means of screening, documenting and analysing samples will also improve.\n\n\n7\nBeyond faulting\nFaults are one of the major manifestations of crustal deformation; folds are another, and the two are often intimately linked. As with faulting, the timing of folding can be dated using associated calcite mineralization, as certain fracture fill (or \u2018vein\u2019) occurrences can be kinematically linked to fold development. Lacombe et al. (2021) provide a recent review of this application and the types of structures that can be utilised. To date, a number of studies have used U-Pb dating of fold-related structures to establish the absolute timing of deformation within various orogenic settings. These include basin inversion resulting from far-field tectonic stress in southern England (Parrish et al., 2018); Laramide and Sevier foreland shortening in the western USA (Beaudoin et al., 2018); shortening and extension due to ophiolite obduction in Oman (Hansman et al., 2018); and nappe stacking in the Pyrenees (Cruset et al., 2020; Hoareau et al., 2021).\nOpening-mode calcite veins in the upper crust can also form due to changes in lithostatic and hydrostatic pressure during burial and exhumation, typically through \u2018overpressure\u2019 relating to trapped fluids in the subsurface. The timing of such vein formation can potentially give information about the burial history of a sedimentary basin and the potential timing and processes of hydrocarbon formation and migration (e.g. Cruset et al., 2021). Overpressure related veins are just one example of opening-mode fractures that are not fault-related. The reviews of Bons et al. (2012), Gale et al. (2014) and Laubach et al. (2019) cover the formation of fracture fills in the various different settings that lie beyond the realm of those directly related to faulting.\nThe dating of calcite related to faulting has to date been restricted to brittle deformation. However, carbonate-bearing rocks can also be found in ductile shear zones. Such rocks, typically occurring as calc-silicates or marbles, could potentially yield information about the timescales of ductile shearing. How conclusive the data acquired would be, requires knowledge about the mineral growth and isotopic resetting \u2013 topics that are currently underexplored. For example, do dissolution-precipitation creep processes, as found in many mylonites and other foliated fault rocks, lead to isotopic resetting of calcite? At what temperature, on geological plausible timescales of heating, does isotopic resetting occur within calcite? At present, the empirical and experimental data on U and Pb diffusion within calcite are sparse, with the experimentally derived estimate of Cherniak (1997) indicating that temperatures above >350\u00a0\u00b0C are needed to induce diffusion on relevant length scales. Meinhold et al. (2020) dated a calcite concretion exhibiting cone-in-cone texture that has been deformed. A younger date for a deformed region compared to the undeformed region, led the authors to speculate that the U-Pb had been reset during low-grade regional metamorphism. Calcite within deformed calc-silicate rocks formed under semi-brittle to ductile deformation has been dated from a detachment fault in Turkey (G\u00fcrer, pers comm. 2019; G\u00fcrer et al., 2019), implying that there is potential for the dating of ductile shear-zone activity using this method.\n\n\n8\nFuture directions\nThe future directions for using calcite geochronology fall under two areas. The first lies within the development and improvements to the analytical techniques themselves. At present, LA-ICP-MS U-Pb is being rapidly adopted by many groups as it is requires instrumentation that is commonly available in many institutions and research centres. Other isotope systems that require clean suites for chemical procedures are likely to remain less popular. A new generation of instrumentation, whereby collision cell technology is employed in ICP-MS instrumentation, both of the quadrupole and multi-collector types, is opening up new frontiers in other isotope systems. For example, Rb-Sr, a method that was popular in the late 20th century but declined in popularity in the last couple of decades, is undergoing a renaissance, as Rb-Sr dating is now in the reach of LA-ICP-MS instrumentation (e.g. Zack and Hogmalm, 2016; Li et al., 2020; Bevan et al., 2021; Subarkah et al., 2021). Tillberg et al. (2020, 2021) have demonstrated the application of Rb-Sr dating to cogenetic adularia and calcite formed in various fault and fracture-fill mineralization occurrences within the Fennoscandian Shield. Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf are both permissible methods that are achievable using LA-ICP-MS, but require significant ingrowth of the daughter isotopes to reach useful levels of precision; this means a combination of high concentrations of parent Sm and Lu, and samples that are old enough. How old depends on the instrumentation and concentration, but Simpson et al., (2021a, 2022) have used a quadrupole instrument to demonstrate the ability to date Proterozoic apatite, garnet and calcite using Lu-Hf in situ. Dating young samples (<500 ka) with the U-Th method is not a common method, and developments of laser ablation U-Th dating have been slow to progress. In general, the U contents of vein-related calcite seem too low for the current generation of instrumentation for in situ (laser ablation) measurement, meaning that the method is confined to a micro-drilling and sample dissolution approach (e.g. Uysal et al., 2011; Prouty et al., 2016).\nThe other direction lies in the application of the method to ever more detailed levels of fault and fracture-fill timescales and processes. For example, at the largest scale this may involve campaign-style dating of transform fault systems to learn the complete history of plate boundary evolution. At the finer scale, it can encompass a better understanding of fault recurrence intervals through detailed and precise chronologies of young and active fault systems, potentially impacting our knowledge and prediction of hazardous (seismically active) faults. The method also has significant application to several applied research areas. These include dating faulting in relation to hydrocarbon migration (e.g. Holdsworth et al., 2019) and mineral systems (e.g. Jin et al., 2021), particularly since many economic deposits host calcite as a cogenetic hydrothermal mineral. In general, the information we require about the terrestrial subsurface is changing, with geothermal energy, underground carbon and hydrogen storage, and building of offshore wind farms and onshore nuclear facilities, all being examples where greater knowledge of the timing of fault and fracture-controlled deformation, strength, fluid-flow and permeability of rock volumes are required. Furthermore, the ability to directly link dated calcite to the composition and temperature of the source fluid, through fluid inclusions, stable isotopes (carbon and oxygen), radiogenic isotopes (Sr) and clumped isotopes (\u039447), and the possibility of doing this within or across individual crystal domains (e.g. MacDonald et al., 2019; Drake et al., 2021), means that calcite provides a powerful repository of past fault and fracture-hosted fluid-flow and fluid-rock interaction.\n\n\n9\nSummary\nAs initiated through the pioneering work of Ramsay (1980) on crack-seal processes, calcite mineralization associated with faulting can provide robust constraints on the timing of fault slip and associated fracturing. A key requirement for geochronology, is that detailed field observations and petrographic information of the analysed domains need to be carried out in order to unambiguously link the calcite growth history to fault activity. Crack-seal-slip calcite mineralization typically gives the best opportunity to link dated calcite to specific episodes of fault slip recognized in the field. Various isotope systems (U-Th, U-Pb, Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf) make the technique potentially applicable to fault histories across a wide range of geological timescales. The spatial resolution of the laser ablation technique lends itself to dating of fine-scale, complex-zoned, fault-related calcite.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nNick Roberts: Conceptualization, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Visualization.

They considered an idealized case of simple shear with or without additional dilation\/compaction across the zone. Ramsay's analysis formed the basis for a new way to deal with shear zones and the relation between their displacement, strain and internal structure in a quantitative way, as exposed in several analytical papers from the 1970s and 80s (e.g., Ramsay and Graham, 1970; Ramsay and Allison, 1979; Simpson, 1983). This fundamental framework was soon expanded into more general strain types (Coward, 1976; Coward and Kim, 1981), including sub-simple shear (Ramberg, 1975; Ramberg and Ghosh, 1977; Simpson and De Paor, 1993) and transpression\/transtension (Sanderson and Marchini, 1984; Fossen and Tikoff, 1993, 1998; Robin and Cruden, 1994). Another important step forward was the general awareness that deformation in shear zones is not only heterogeneous, but also partitioned into different components, from the grain scale to that of plate boundaries (Lister and Williams, 1983; Tikoff and Teyssier, 1994; Jones and Tanner, 1995; Clegg and Holdsworth, 2005; Carreras et al., 2013) and that many if not most geologic structures repeat themselves at all such scales. Some of the earliest studies of foliation trajectories associated with ductile shear zones were made by John Ramsay (e.g., Ramsay, 1967; Ramsay and Graham, 1970). An excellent understanding of what was later called S-C fabrics, asymmetric boudins, and lineations and folding associated with shear zones followed (e.g., Escher et al., 1975), leading to the classification of shear-related foliations as S-C-C\u2032 structures (e.g., Berth\u00e9 et al., 1979; Lister and Snoke, 1984) and the frequently observed partitioning of deformation into simple shear bands separating domains dominated by rotation and\/or flattening (Dennis and Secor, 1990), and into zones of coaxial deformation within a simple shear zone due to slip along layer contacts (Harris and Cobbold, 1984).\nA related example is deformation partitioning in rocks with rigid inclusions such as porphyroclast systems, and understanding the underlying processes enables us to use the resulting asymmetric geometries as kinematic indicators in shear zones (Passchier and Simpson, 1986); they can sometimes also be used to estimate vorticity quantitatively (Marques et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2009; \u00c1vila et al., 2019). The understanding of S-C-C\u2019 structures, and asymmetric shear zone fabrics and other kinematic indicators in general, led in the 1980s to what is arguably the most important advance in field-related structural geology for many decades, allowing kinematics to be readily interpreted from mere field and thin section observations of sheared rock. The same kinematic indicators have subsequently been applied to interpretations of regional ductile shear zones using remote sensing (e.g., Martelat et al., 2000) and aeromagnetic data (Stewart and Betts, 2010; Jessell et al., 2012; Harris and B\u00e9dard, 2014; Cleven et al., 2020; Harris, this volume), including mapping strain partitioning in regional transpressional shear systems (e.g., Cleven et al., 2020, their Fig. 16).\nUnderstanding shear zone structures is extremely important, given their close link to tectonics (displacements, strains and kinematics recorded in sheared rocks are paramount to both the identification and testing of regional tectonic models), their controls on mineralization and related hydrothermal fluid flow and pluton emplacement.\nIn this contribution we will analyze structural aspects of the shear zone network in the Borborema Province in NE Brazil, based on the fundamental knowledge that developed from John Ramsay and others\u2019 work in the second half of the 20th century. The shear zone network in the Borborema Province in NE Brazil on the N margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig. 1\n), and its extension into Africa on the N margin of the Congo Craton in continental reconstructions (e.g., Caby, 1989; Arthaud et al., 2008) is one of the largest ductile shear zone systems on Earth and covers aspects of shear zone structure from the micro-scale to that of more than 2000\u00a0km. In NE Brazil, the shear zone system is reasonably well exposed, mapped on a regional scale by the Brazilian Geological Survey (CPRM, geosgb.cprm.gov.br; Fig. 2\na) and, for the most part, covered by a consistent medium-resolution aeromagnetic data set that we here employ to better interpret its internal structure and kinematics. Whilst, with some exceptions (e.g., the combined aeromagnetic and gravity research of Oliveira and Medeiros, 2018 and the study of dikes by Melo et al., 2022), most previous interpretations of aeromagnetic data in the Borborema Province are either detailed local studies (e.g., Santos et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2019) or were applied more to mapping of lithostratigraphy, igneous intrusions, and basement fabric controls on rifts (Bezerra et al., 2014; Vasconcelos et al., 2019), and not the detailed structure of the Brasiliano shear network. Mocitaiba et al. (2017) present low resolution aeromagnetic images for the Parna\u00edba Basin overlying the western part of this shear system, though only an approximation of the continuation of the two main E-W shears is discernible (flight lines are mainly from 1 to 4\u00a0km apart, although one small area is covered by 500\u00a0m line data). Our focus, however, is to use enhanced aeromagnetic data to study the kinematics and geometry of structures of the two major Patos and Pernambuco shear zones of the region and the E-W trending deformed Central Domain (a.k.a. Transversal Domain; Van Schmus et al., 2011), and in part the Northern Domain adjacent to the Patos shear zone. A subordinate aim is to show how different enhancements of the same initial aeromagnetic data allow the maximum amount of detail to be extracted in regional structural analysis, hence additional enlarged high-resolution images are included in the accompanying Supplementary Material.\n\n\n2\nGeneral setting of the Borborema shear system\nThe Borborema shear zone network in the Borborema Province developed in Archean-Proterozoic crust in the late Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) to early Cambrian, during the regional Brasiliano\u2013Pan-African orogenic cycle associated with the amalgamation of Gondwana (Caby, 1989; Arthaud et al., 2008; de Wit and Reeves, 2008; Van Schmus et al., 2008; Neves et al., 2021a). The Borborema Province is tectonically separated from the presently exposed S\u00e3o Francisco\u2013Congo craton by the Rio do Pontal-Sergipano-Central African belt, whose main Neoproterozoic tectonic rift-related events follow either Paleoproterozoic rifting or subduction and continental arc magmatism, depending on different authors (discussed below). The Borborema Province is separated from the Amazon and West African cratons by the Cear\u00e1 Central and Transbrasiliano-Kandi strike-slip system, part of the major West Gondwana orogen (Fig. 1). The latter includes a collisional event where subduction of oceanic crust during closure of the Goi\u00e1s-Pharusian ocean east of Amazonia led to collision between the Amazonian and S\u00e3o Francisco cratons around 620-610\u00a0Ma (Fetter et al., 2003; Ganade de Araujo et al., 2014a,b). Proterozoic and older rocks of the Borborema Province are overlain by a number of Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary basins, beneath which the shear zone system can be traced on aeromagnetic images.\nDiverse models have been proposed for the formation of Borborema Province sequences, especially in the Central and Southern domains. The Central Domain records evidence for formation, metamorphism and deformation of a 2125\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 and 2044\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma juvenile crust, 2.05\u20132.03\u00a0Ga Transamazonian metamorphism, and 1.99\u20131.97\u00a0Ga late-to post-Transamazonian magmatism (Neves et al., 2006). Mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Carmo Suite and felsic rocks of the Pedra d'\u00c1gua Suite of the Central Domain (Santos et al., 2015) overlap formation of the N-S trending 2.2 to 2.0\u00a0Ga Salitre Rift in the N S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (de Paula Garcia et al., 2021). Magmatic events and amphibolite facies metamorphism in orthogneisses and supracrustal rocks (Neves et al., 2006) in the Central Domain suggest an E-W rift, contemporaneous with the Salitre Rift, initiated in the Paleoproterozoic, where the change of rift orientation and mafic-ultramafic magmatism suggest the possibility for a mantle plume, although more research is required to confirm this.\nThe Southern and Central domains subsequently went through a history of intracontinental Tonian rifting from \u223c1000 to 820\u00a0Ma, reactivating the Paleoproterozoic rift, which may have culminated in, or have been further reactivated between 630 and 610\u00a0Ma. This was a time of deposition of supracrustal sequences, formation of flat-lying foliations and Brasiliano high-T\/low-P metamorphism (Caby et al., 1995; Caby and Atthaud, 1986; Neves et al., 2000, 2005, 2016), again consistent with an extensional tectonic setting. Other models invoke one or more subduction-accretion events (e.g., Oliveira et al., 2010; Santosde Oliveira et al., 2021), but as Neves et al. (2016) contend, no conclusive evidence is seen for a subduction-related magmatic arc on the N margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton between 1000 and 920\u00a0Ma in the SW part of the Southern Domain (Caxito et al., 2020) or for the oceanic subduction and collision between 635 and 580\u00a0Ma suggested by Brito Neves et al. (2016) and Caxito et al. (2014, 2017, 2021). Indeed, seismic tomographic and gravity data suggest that the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton continues beneath the southern, especially southeastern part of the Borborema Province (Rocha et al., 2019; Ganade et al., 2021).\nInternally, the Borborema Province underwent intracontinental deformation during this entire Neoproterozoic period, and the general understanding is that multiple intraplate rifting events described above were followed by subduction-related orogeny along the northern margin of Borborema (the Cear\u00e1 Central domain north of the Patos Shear Zone) around 620\u2013600\u00a0Ma, followed by transcurrent shearing and magmatism mainly between 590 and 570\u00a0Ma (Archanjo et al., 2008, 2011; Neves et al., 2015, 2016; Ganade et al., 2021). This time interval is largely based on dating of several of the many granitic bodies in the province (Ganade de Araujo et al., 2014b; Ganade et al., 2021; \u00c1vila et al., 2019). Along with the intrusion of mostly granitoid bodies, the Borborema crust underwent partial melting at the time of shearing, particularly in the Northern Domain, within the Patos shear zone and in the central and western part of the Pernambuco shear zone. Basement rocks in the Central domain are also migmatized, but the age of this migmatization is not well constrained. The widespread partial melting underscores the hot nature of the tectonic events in the Ediacaran and the weak nature of the crust (Cavalcante et al., 2016).\nPast research has established a bulk dextral sense of displacement on the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones (e.g., Vauchez et al., 1995; Corsini et al., 1991; Viegas et al., 2014; Archanjo et al., 2021). Most authors also show a dominance of dextral shear on NE-striking shear zones north of the Patos shear zone, whereas there are highly conflicting interpretations of the sense of displacement on similarly oriented shear zones in the Central Domain. For example, a sinistral sense was assigned by Archanjo et al. (1999), Neves et al. (2005, 2012, 2021b), Ganade de Araujo et al. (2014b) and Pereira et al. (2019), while Tommasi et al. (1995) and Vauchez et al. (1995, 1998), Vauchez and Egydio-Silva (1992), Caxito et al. (2016, 2020, 2021), Oliveira and Medeiros (2018) and Liu et al. (2019) infer dextral shearing for the same structures. Our study attempts to clarify these disparate interpretations, and we demonstrate that these prominent NE-striking shear zones in the Central Domain are clearly sinistral.\n\n\n3\nBorborema aeromagnetic data, processing and applications\n\n3.1\nAeromagnetic data and its enhancement\nThe aeromagnetic data employed in this project was a compilation produced by the Brazilian company GSM Geophysics of data acquired in 2008 through a joint effort by the Brazilian Geological Survey and the Ministry of Mines and Energy along variably but mainly NW-SE oriented flight lines at a 100\u00a0m nominal height and with a 500\u00a0m spacing, interpolated on a 126\u00a0m grid. The initial Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) data in Fig. 3\na and Supplementary Material Fig. 1a (Supplementary Material figures are subsequently referred to as SM1a, etc.) show high (red) to low (blue) anomalies that relate to rock magnetic susceptibility, largely due to the presence of magnetite and other magnetic minerals (see Isles and Rankin, 2011 and Dentith and Mudge, 2014 for explanations of the magnetic geophysical technique). In order to use this data for lithologic and structural mapping, a reduction to the pole (RTP) algorithm was applied to locate the magnetic anomalies above their causative rock bodies (Fig. 3b, SM1b). Without this initial RTP treatment, large magnetic highs have commensurate large magnetic lows, giving a false impression of different juxtaposed high and low magnetic values for those not used to interpreting geophysical data. Additionally, anomalies are laterally displaced from their sources and false more E-W trends sometimes appear in the data that are not validated by mapping, at the expense of more N-S structures. Some folds and planar structures that are not recognizable from the original TMI map are then identified; these are largely consistent with the geologic map (Fig. 2a), but not completely, because geologic maps show surface expressions in areas of outcrop while magnetic images also contain information from the subsurface (see Isles and Rankin, 2011). Total field magnetic images therefore reflect lithologic and structural patterns that are representative for a volume of crust in comparison to classical geologic maps based on surface observations. Volumes corresponding to different source depth ranges can, however, be extracted using filtering techniques in the frequency domain based on changes of slope of the radially averaged power spectrum (Spector and Grant, 1970; Likkason, 2011), hence near surface short wavelength (\u201cresidual\u201d) components that, with source depth less than ca. 10\u00a0km, relate more directly to surface geologic maps were separated from deeper crustal, long wavelength components (Fig. 3c). This method is preferred to more commonly used vertical derivatives (e.g. 1VD; Fig. 3d) as residual potential field images contain less noise and one has a control on source depths portrayed; the images also reflect measurements in a given depth range in nT instead of gradients (i.e. nT\/m) as in the 1VD. RTP aeromagnetic data was also converted to pseudo-gravity potential (Baranov, 1957; more commonly shorted to pseudo-gravity), a treatment based on Poisson's relationship between gravitational and magnetic potential fields (Poisson, 1826) assuming constant magnetization. Pseudo-gravity (Fig. 4\n) accentuates deep crustal domains due to vertical integration incorporated in its calculation. Especially where their edges are enhanced (Fig. 4b and c), pseudo-gravity depth slices provide complementary information to that provided by standard treatments of aeromagnetic and gravity data (Cooper and Cowan, 2005; Jekeli et al., 2010).\nBoth residual magnetic and pseudo-gravity images were enhanced for structural interpretation. The tilt angle (= arctan of the ratio of the vertical derivative and the total horizontal derivative; Miller and Singh, 1994; Salem et al., 2007, as in Fig. 3e) and theta map\/angle (Wijns et al., 2005) derived from the analytic signal, itself calculated from horizontal and vertical gradients (Roest et al., 1992), highlight contacts and structures such as faults and ductile shear zones, and enhance subtle features in aeromagnetic data. Using the theta angle to highlight edges (contacts) in aeromagnetic data, as in Fig. 3c, and pseudo-gravity data (Fig. 4b and c) is especially advantageous close to the equator to help overcome any distortion arising from the reduction to the pole (Wijns et al., 2005). More examples of the use of theta angle images for portraying complex fold geometries are included in the Supplementary Material. Ternary combinations of different gradient-based images (Fig. 3f) increase contrast, and these are especially useful in portraying foliation trajectories (Fig. 5\n) and to differentiate between different types of intrusions.\nMultiscale edges in the horizontal gradient of pseudo-gravity data for different source depths, commonly termed \u201cworms\u201d (a wavelet analysis technique developed by Hornby et al., 1999, conceived independently, although purely theoretically, by Moreau et al., 1997). Pseudo-gravity worms highlight sharp magnetic contrasts that result from discontinuities or interfaces between different lithologies or geologic structures such as faults, unconformities, or intrusive contacts (Holden et al., 2000). Worms also portray differences between near-surface and deeper structures (Fig. 4d), and also provide a rapid means to estimate dips of faults or lithologic contacts. Further details on \u2018worming\u2019 methodology are provided by Hornby (2019) and Holden et al. (2000), and a regional example of pseudo-gravity (\u2018magnetic\u2019) worms is given by Vos et al. (2006). Worms also provide a means of verifying reduction to the pole calculations which may be problematic if remanent magnetization is present or, as for NE Brazil, areas close to the equator. Comparison between pseudo-gravity worms calculated from RTP aeromagnetic data with geologic contacts mapped in the field confirms the validity of undertaking RTP for our study area (see SM6-7).\n\n\n3.2\nAeromagnetic expression of Brasiliano shear zones in the Borborema Province\nIn addition to complementing previous regional mapping, enhanced aeromagnetic images provide hitherto unknown details of shear zone kinematics and geometries, fold styles and orientation, strain distribution, and controls on shear localization. The ternary gradient images shown in Figs. 3f and 6 enhance the foliation trajectories to produce a high-contrast structural image that portrays the structural shear zone pattern particularly well. This image tends to display felsic rocks in red-orange, and supracrustal rocks in tones of blue and black. Neoproterozoic and younger metasedimentary rocks with rather uniform magnetic properties have a bright and uniform expression. Paleozoic-Mesozoic basins attenuate the magnetic signal from underlying units, but they can still be recognized to some degree, for instance under the Araripe and Parna\u00edba basins. A modified version of this map (included in Supplementary Material) that provides another visual representation of structure was used together with Fig. 3f for structural interpretation. A manual structural interpretation based on the enhanced residual aeromagnetic anomaly maps and an interpretation of main shear zones and their kinematics is shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. Mesozoic dikes have been excluded in these map interpretations.\nComparing the processed aeromagnetic images and the manual structural interpretation with the surface geologic maps produced by the Brazilian Geological Survey, we see a clear correlation between lithologic boundaries and RTP aeromagnetic anomalies (compare Fig. 2a with 2b and images in Fig. 3). Several of the granitoid bodies are easily correlated, as are fold and shear zone patterns. The aeromagnetic images also reveal how the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones continue westwards underneath the Parna\u00edba basin. Fig. 6\n provides an example of an enlarged area to show the expression of shear zones on different enhancements. The increased contrast in the ternary image better portrays foliation trajectories. Overlaying a simplified interpretation of ductile shears from the ternary image on the intermediate wavelength pseudo-gravity image in Fig. 6c (highlighting deeper lithologic domains) in Fig. 6d shows that several NE-SW to ENE-WSW sinistral, antithetic shears are controlled by lithologic domain margins. The ternary image in Fig. 6b also clearly shows the location and differences in deformation of felsic rocks not so apparent in the initial, residual image in (a): the orange-colored granitoid body at the left (W) margin is unfoliated but cut by fractures whereas many other layers in orange are highly foliated. Further detailed comparisons are given in the Supplementary Material.\n\n\n\n4\nThe Patos and Pernambuco shear zones\nThe roughly E-W trending Patos and Pernambuco shear zones are the main features of the shear network of the Borborema Province (Figs. 1 and 2). They are up to a few tens of kilometers wide and characterized by steep foliation and dextral offsets, although the Patos shear zone is thicker and internally more complex. Calculations of average dips from the surface to 5\u00a0km depth based on pseudo-gravity worms show E-W shear structures within the Patos shear zone dipping between ca. 50\u00b0 S and 78\u00b0 S, although in its western part one shear zone between two S-dipping shear structures dips northwards between ca. 45\u00b0 and 65\u00b0. Shear structures in the western half of the Pernambuco shear zone dip between ca. 40\u00b0 NNE and 55\u00b0 NNE, while no clear dips could be established in its eastern half. The Patos and Pernabuco shear zones can be traced continuously for more than 700\u00a0km in length; aeromagnetic data suggest they continue southwestward beneath the Parna\u00edba Basin and merges with the Transbrasiliano lineament (de Castro et al., 2016). In tectonic reconstructions, the Patos-Pernambuco shear system correlates with shear zones of the same age on the N margin of the Congo Craton, hence their total original length was at least 2000\u00a0km (Fig. 1; Caby, 1989; de Wit at al., 2008; Julios et al., 2020). Occurrences of unsheared Cambrian to Cretaceous sediments (Fig. 2) provide a minimum age for the ductile shearing history. They are, however, affected by brittle deformation associated with the Cretaceous rifting that led to the pre-opening rifting of the Atlantic margins.\n\n4.1\nThe Pernambuco shear zone\nThe Pernambuco shear zone is composed of two almost straight segments (west and east Pernambuco shear zone, separated by the Mesozoic Jatob\u00e1 Basin) with a rather abrupt but continuous change in orientation at the northern boundary of the Jatob\u00e1 basin (Figs. 2 and 3). The shear zone stands out as a marked and continuous lineament on the aeromagnetic images that separates rocks of different ages and of different lithologies and magnetic properties (Fig. 3). It has previously been suggested that these two segments are unconnected and associated with relatively limited displacements (Vauchez and Egydio-Silva, 1992; Neves and Mariano, 1999). However, the magnetic data (Fig. 3) and structural considerations presented here support the view that the segments are connected and form a single large-displacement ductile shear zone, and that one or two sub-parallel shear segments occur south of the east Pernambuco shear zone (Fig. 7\n).\nThe Pernambuco shear zone is a predominantly ductile (plastic) structure with classic rotation of foliations and lithologic units into the zone, particularly well-developed along its northern margin (Fig. 7). The shear zone contains evidence for both high- and low-temperature deformation (Neves and Mariano, 1999; Castellan et al., 2020), suggesting that the shear zone was active at a range of thermal conditions. For the eastern Pernambuco shear zone, Castellan et al. (2020) estimate conditions of 0.475\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0GPa and 526\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0\u00b0C in synkinematic granitoids of the Caruaru domain and 0.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0GPa and 437\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0\u00b0C in the Gravat\u00e1 domain further east. Brittle reactivation of the ductile gneissic or mylonitic fabric is also seen, and a U-Pb age of calcite fibers on one such normal-sense slip surface provided a lower Cretaceous age of 135\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma, taken to date the time of reactivation (Miranda et al., 2020). This is the time of Mesozoic rifting of the region, with formation of the nearby Jatob\u00e1 basin of the R\u00eaconcavo-Tucano-Jatob\u00e1 rift system.\nThe shear zone thickness is here defined as the distance between points where the external fabric starts to rotate into the shear zone. This thickness is \u223c20\u00a0km in the west, where the Pernambuco shear zone gets covered by Silurian and younger rocks of the Parna\u00edba basin. It then decreases to 10\u00a0km near the W margin of the Jatob\u00e1 basin, where part of the shear zone has been faulted and covered by the clastic basin fill. Eastwards from the Jatob\u00e1 basin, the zone seems to be only around 5\u00a0km thick on average, getting close to 10\u00a0km again near the Atlantic coast. This could reflect an eastward drop in displacement from the location of the Jatob\u00e1 basin. Such an eastward drop in displacement was explained by a northeastward splaying of the shear zone (Vauchez and Egydio-Silva, 1992). However, this model predicts the splays to be dextral, whereas they are clearly portrayed as sinistral on the aeromagnetic images. Instead, our study shows that dextral displacement is accommodated on several dextral shear zones parallel to and S of the east Pernambuco shear zone with both N and S dips (Figs. 2b and 3).\nThe magnetic images also show a southern shear zone segment that underlies the basin, forming a lens-shaped geometry with the main Pernambuco trend. We interpret this lens-shaped geometry as a possible linkage structure, where the two main segments of the Pernambuco shear zone initiated as individual shear zones of slightly different orientations and linked during mutual propagation (Fig. 7e\u2013f) \u2013 a lengthening mechanism that is extremely common for faults (e.g., Walsh et al., 2003; Fossen, 2016), but also demonstrated for ductile shear zones (Fossen and Cavalcante, 2017).\nA dextral sense of shear is consistently observed along the Pernambuco shear zone. This is clearly expressed by rotation of foliations and lithologic units into the shear zone that can be seen both from the geologic and aeromagnetic anomaly maps (Fig. 7). This shear sense is also evident from outcrop to microscale structures as observed in the field and thin section (e.g., Neves et al., 2000).\n\n4.1.1\nHorizontal displacements\nThe aeromagnetic data helps to constrain the thickness of the shear zone and to visualize the pattern of rotation of host-rock fabrics into the zone. This pattern can be utilized to construct strain profiles across the shear zone, as has been done along two sections across the western segment where the pattern is particularly clear (Fig. 7). We assumed simple shear deformation and employed the equation for rotation of preexisting passive markers (Ramsay 1980):\n\ncot\u03b2'\u00a0=\u00a0cot\u03b2\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b3\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the angle that the marker initially makes with the shear zone, and \u03b2\u2032 is the new angle whose value will depend on the local shear strain (\u03b3). It is possible that the shear zone deformation deviates from simple shear, which would introduce an error to the strain estimates. However, the large offset of this shear zone suggests that the simple shear component is completely dominating, and the largest error comes from accurately determining the angle \u03b2\u2032 where strain is high. In this portion of the zone the foliation is almost parallel to the shear zone, and small variations in the angle make large differences in calculated shear strain. We have used the assumption that the strain in the central part of the zone is as high as it is where we lose control as we move through its margin, i.e. \u03b3\u00a0\u2248\u00a050\u201360. In other words, we made the strain profile flat across the inner and highest strained part of the zone. The results (Fig. 7d) show classical shear strain profiles, and integration of shear strain over the width of the zone (Ramsay 1980) yields estimates of around 308 and 222\u00a0km.\nThis amount of displacement (222\u2013308\u00a0km) is corroborated by the offset of units along the shear zone. In particular, the Tonian Lagoa das Contendas complex, shown in Fig. 7b in violet color, appears to have been displaced around 200\u00a0km along the zone before vanishing in a highly sheared state within the zone. If we consider other Tonian subracrustal units on both sides of the shear zone, an offset on the order of 200\u00a0km is also indicated (Figs. 7c and 8\nc). Paleoproterozoic gneissic units also show an apparent lateral offset in excess of 200\u00a0km (Fig. 8b). A similar estimate was made by Ganade et al. (2021) based on the regional distribution of radiometric model ages. In summary, the consistency between our structural analysis and offset patterns of rock units leads us to the conclusion that the ductile Ediacaran strike-slip displacement of the Pernambuco shear zone is about 200\u2013250\u00a0km.\n\n\n\n4.2\nThe Patos shear zone\nThe more than 700\u00a0km long Patos shear zone is located almost 200\u00a0km north of the Pernambuco shear zone, in the middle of the Borborema Province (Fig. 1). A NE-trending segment links the Western Patos shear zone with the Pernambuco shear zone and continues under the eastern part of the Parna\u00edba basin to merge with the Transbrasiliano lineament (de Castro et al., 2016). In our main study area, the Patos shear zone continues eastwards from the Parna\u00edba basin for \u223c700\u00a0km (Fig. 2); Fig. 9\na\u2013c shows an enlarged image, geologic map and interpreted internal geometry of its central section. An up to 70\u00a0km wide strike-slip duplex (Fig. 10\n) marks the change from its NE-trending western section to the E-W central section (Corsini et al., 1996), possibly with another, somewhat smaller duplex to the southwest (ca. 40.5\u00b0W, 7.5\u00b0S; Fig. 3e and f). The latter is partly covered by Phanerozoic deposits but discernible from the aeromagnetic data.\nEastwards the shear zone continues as the straight central segment of around 30\u00a0km thickness until it bifurcates into several E-W to NE-SW trending branches. The aeromagnetic images show that one branch continues more or less straight towards the coast. Another set of branches is located along the NNE-trending Serid\u00f3 belt (Fig. 9). The Serid\u00f3 belt is interpreted as a high-T transpressional segment with peak metamorphism around 575\u00a0Ma in which deformation is partitioned into a set of subparallel NNE-trending dextral shear zones, thrusts and folds (Archanjo and Bouchez, 1991; Archanjo et al., 2002, 2013; Domingos et al., 2020; Cioffi et al., 2021).\nA characteristic feature of the sheared rocks within the Patos shear zone is the range in thermal conditions recorded during deformation. In its main E-W segment from Cajazeiras past Patos (Fig. 2c), the main portion of the shear zone is hot with the occurrence of syn-kinematic metatexites and diatexites that formed together with high-temperature banded gneisses, where the melt has been dated to around 565\u00a0Ma (Viegas et al., 2014; Archanjo et al., 2021). Temperatures of 550\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C at 0.3\u20130.4\u00a0GPa were determined from metamorphic assemblages in the Serid\u00f3 Belt ca. 60\u00a0km\u00a0N of the Patos shear zone (Cioffi et al., 2021). However, its southern part is constituted by low-temperature mylonites. It is not clear if these variations in thermal conditions are due to differential syntectonic exhumation or migration or localization of deformation during regional cooling. It has been suggested that the shear zone acted as a vertical conduit for melt that would weaken and heat it (Cavalcante et al., 2016), which could also cause lateral thermal variations. Transpressional deformation is suggested for internal parts of the strike-slip duplex, where thrusting appears to be synchronous with the overall strike-slip motion (Corsini et al., 1996). Overall, however, we consider the Patos shear zone to be approximately simple shear. The consistent dextral sense of shear (little evidence of conjugate shear bands) exhibited by abundant field-scale kinematic indicators (Fig. 7) supports this view.\n\n4.2.1\nRelationship between regional folding and shearing N of the Patos shear zone\nThe area N of the Patos shear zone, enlarged in Fig. 6a\u2013c, shows that whilst in the NE corner of the residual aeromagnetic image in (a) a foliation trending NE-SW appears to be sheared into parallelism with the Patos shear zone, the intermediate wavelength pseudo-gravity image (Fig. 6b) clearly portrays a very tight to isoclinal overturned synform with NE-dipping axial surface, thickening in the hinge and\/or thinning in the limbs (\u201cregional isoclinal fold\u201d in Fig. 6b). The fold axial trace and shear zone thus define a regional S-C relationship (as described by Ramsay, 1967). This fold was not shown on the geologic map of the Borborema Province in Fig. 2 nor in other enhancements of aeromagnetic data in Fig. 3c\u2013e. Folds with similarly oriented axial traces are also observed in regional pseudo-gravity data in the Northern Domain outside our study area. This is an excellent example of how significant regional folds may easily go unidentified in high grade terrains, as foliations mapped in the field and conventional enhancements to show near surface features (such as the most commonly used first vertical derivative, 1VD) are tectonic fabrics where lithologic layering is transposed into parallelism with fold axial surfaces. A similar example in another high-grade gneiss terrain is portrayed in pseudo-gravity data by Harris (this volume).\n\n\n4.2.2\nInternal structures and kinematics of the Patos shear zone\nThe rotation of external fabrics into the shear zone and synthetic dextral C\u2032 shears indicate dextral kinematics within the main shear zone, although merging shear zones of the Central Domain give sinistral shear along parts of its southern margin. Dextral kinematics are also consistently observed in the field (Fig. 11\n) and thin section, associated with subhorizontal lineations and a steep shear zone foliation in outcrop (although pseudo-gravity worms indicate that dips may shallow with depth). As observed from the processed aeromagnetic maps, asymmetric folds occur in several places. A particularly clear example of such folding exists on the NE side of the duplex (Fig. 10c). These folds occur in the extensional sector of the instantaneous strain ellipse for dextral shear (Fig. 12\na) and represent a classical example of quarter structures commonly seen on smaller scales (F in Fig. 11). There are also slightly oblique km-scale shear bands within the shear zone that, together with the foliation, create large-scale S-C\u2019 structures (Fig. 10a). Also, large asymmetric lenses that bear similarities to asymmetric porphyroclasts can be seen from the aeromagnetic images (Fig. 10b; c.f. Harris and B\u00e9dard, 2014 and Harris, this volume).\n\n\n4.2.3\nShear strain and displacement\nAs for the Pernambuco shear zone, rotation of foliation in the wall rock into the shear zone can be used to constrain displacement. We have performed such analyses across three profiles (Fig. 9d). The western one (Profile A) captures the shear strain immediately west of the Serid\u00f3 belt. A gradual increase in shear strain is recorded across the northern margin over a distance of about 12\u00a0km, adding up to a displacement of \u223c170\u00a0km before entering the core of the shear zone. In the core, where the average shear strain is roughly estimated to around 50\u201360 (Fig. 9d), the foliation is subparallel to the shear zone and affected by low-angle C\u2019 shear bands, which makes shear strain estimation inaccurate. As for the Pernambuco sections above, we could take the shear zone in the core to be similar to that of the most sheared part of the margin. This assumption, together with the \u223c17\u00a0km thickness of the zone, would imply around 1000\u00a0km of displacement. However, this must be an overestimate, because kinematically, the southern part of the Patos shear zone is sinistral, representing the northern part of NE-striking sinistral shear zones of the Central Domain that were zipped together with the dextral Patos during shearing.\nThe other two profiles show similar marginal geometry and strain and suggest similar levels of shear strain (\u03b3 close to 60) and minimum horizontal displacements of roughly 300\u00a0km (Profile B) and 200\u00a0km (Profile C). The eastward reduction in displacement estimates for profiles B and C goes together with an eastward reduction in thickness, which again is related to the bifurcation of the Patos shear zone immediately east of Profile A. A considerable part of the Patos shear zone strain is probably taken up by the Serid\u00f3 belt, as documented as a dextral transpressional zone by several authors (e.g., Corsini et al., 1991; Hackspacher et al., 1997; Archanjo et al., 2002, 2013; Cioffi et al., 2021). This belt represents an eastward dextral splay of the shear zone. As such, it is different from the apparent splays seen along the Pernambuco shear zone, where the NE-SW splays themselves are sinistral (see below). Hence, we conclude that the main Patos shear zone involves displacement on the order of several hundred kilometers, and that this displacement is partitioned between northeastward-trending shear zones within and parallel to the Serid\u00f3 belt and the eastward direct continuation of the Patos shear zone toward the Atlantic coast.\nDisplacement can be independently evaluated by the offset of lithologic units. Dextral shearing of the Edicarian Serid\u00f3 Formation (Fig. 8a) implies more than 230\u00a0km of displacement in the northern margin and central part of the Patos shear zone. Along the southern margin, other Edicarian supracrustals are sheared at least 100\u00a0km. Adding these two components gives a minimum displacement estimate of 330\u00a0km for the Patos shear zone as a whole. Similarly, a minimum of 350\u00a0km displacement is indicated by sheared Archean units (notably the Granjeiro Complex; Archanjo et al., 2021) (Fig. 8c). Deflection of Tonian supracrustals indicates at least 120\u00a0km displacement along the south side of the East Patos shear zone (Fig. 8a). Paleoproterozoic metaigneous rocks within the Patos shear zone may also suggest displacement on the order of 350\u00a0km (Fig. 8b). Hence, the estimates from structural analysis and the distribution of lithologic units as observed from the geologic map pattern roughly agree, with a displacement of around 350\u00a0km, and a displacement of >100\u00a0km for the eastern segment that continues straight eastward to the Atlantic coast.\nFinally, displacement can also be constrained from shear zone thickness, as thickness generally scales with displacement. Displacement was estimated for twelve shear zones (excluding the Pernambuco and Patos) using patterns of rotation of structures through the zones or the offset of lithologies and magnetically distinct anomalies. With a 10\u201372\u00a0km range in maximum displacement and a 2.5\u201320\u00a0km range in maximum thickness (Fig. 13\n) the data confirms that displacement scales positively and linearly with thickness, so that displacement for a given shear zone is close to 10 times its thickness. Our Borborema observations are consistent with the global trend presented by Fossen and Cavalcante (2017). When plotting our 200\u00a0km estimate from the Pernambuco and 350\u00a0km estimate from the Patos shear zone in Fig. 13, it is clear that they fit the trend defined by the other Borborema shear zones.\n\n\n\n4.3\nThe shear zone network of the Central Domain\nThe Central (or Transverse) Domain is the volume of rocks bounded by the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones. This 200\u00a0km wide domain exposed in Borborema for 700\u00a0km is affected by a number of interconnected steep shear zones, each with a thickness of up to 20\u00a0km. Its numerous Neoproterozoic granites also show an average NE-SW oriented long axis (X-strain axis) that is different from that of the Northern Domain (closer to NNE-SSW), reflecting the difference in strain in these two domains (Fig. 2). This defines a structural expression that is different from the northern and, in particular, the southern domain, suggesting that these shear zones formed during the ductile shearing on the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones.\nBased on our structural analysis of aeromagnetic anomaly images, the internal shear zones of the Central Domain fall into two populations that can be separated based on both orientation and kinematics (Fig. 2c). The dominant group is NE-SW oriented (average strike of 050\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0) and sinistral, and thus antithetic to the other, dextral population (average strike of 100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00b0). The most prominent shear zone belonging to the dextral population is the Coxixola shear zone (Fig. 2c), which stretches for about 300\u00a0km in the eastern and central part of the Central Domain (Hollanda et al., 2010).\nDifferent models can be called for to explain the internal shear zone pattern of the Central Domain. First of all, the prominent NE-SW trending set parallels the general lithologic structure of the domain, and if this map-scale lithologic zonation is pre-shearing, as indicated by Ganade de Araujo et al. (2014), this may explain why there are so many NE-SW trending shear zones in the Central Domain. One approach is to consider the two sets as extensional shear bands. The dextral set has a few elements that would classify as reverse shear bands (Dennis and Secor, 1990) and some are parallel to the Patos shear zone (C-bands), but most are slightly oblique to the Patos shear zone in an extensional sense, and can be classified as (extensional) C\u2032 shear bands (e.g., Berth\u00e9 et al., 1979) or ecc1 (Platt, 1984). The sinistral antithetic set would then be considered conjugate C\u2033 shear bands or ecc2 (Platt, 1984; Xypolias, 2010). Well-developed C\u2033 bands characterize shear zones with a coaxial component (e.g., subsimple shear or transpression), implying a component of N-S shortening across the system. Based primarily on numerical modeling, Grasemann et al. (2003) concluded that conjugate sets of shear bands indicate pure shear-dominated flow with a kinematic vorticity number Wk\u00a0<\u00a00.6, and Xypolias et al. (2010) used this approach to map variations in vorticity in ductile thrust zones in Greece. Xypolias (2010) also pointed out that shear bands can be used to calculate vorticity, as shown in his Fig. 11. Using this rather uncertain approach, the maximum angle of our synthetic set (30\u00b0) to the Patos shear zone would give a Wk of roughly 0.5 for the bulk deformation of the Central Domain (note that individual shear zones would still be approximately simple shear).\nOn the contrary, Finch et al. (2020) demonstrate numerically that subordinate antithetic shears can develop also during bulk simple shearing, particularly in models with a large (45%) weak phase. In the case of the Borborema, partial melt could possibly represent the weak phase, as seen in other migmatitic terrains (e.g., Cleven et al., 2020). If so, the deformation may be less coaxial than the above estimate of Wk\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.5. On the other hand, the antithetic shear bands reported by Finch et al. (2020) are very short, rather diffuse and not comparable to the extensive NE-striking shear zones of the Central Domain that are localized along lithostratigraphic domains.\nIn anisotropic rocks and analogue materials, antithetic shears may also be associated with boudinage of a competent layer (e.g., Lister and Snoke, 1984) or develop within a layer, forming a conjugate set with shear zones of the opposite sense of displacement due to strain partitioning during layer parallel slip (Harris and Cobbold, 1984).\nAs an alternative approach, we consider the two sets of semi-regional shear zones within the Central Domain as classical conjugate shear zones that initially were bisected by the instantaneous shortening direction. Any noncoaxial component would cause progressive rotation of the sets, and the bisector would not accurately represent the finite shortening direction anymore. In our case the antithetic set would rotate faster (clockwise) by an amount that increases with increasing Wk. The current angle between the bisectrix is only 15\u00b0 west of north, making a \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a075\u00b0 to an E-W shear plane. Back-rotating the sinistral set counterclockwise would lower this angle, but the 60\u00b0 counterclockwise rotation required for a simple shear deformation is unrealistic. Hence, although we do not know the exact rotation of this set, this approach implies a component of coaxial deformation that thinned and extended the Central Domain.\nBased on the above considerations, we find indications of a component of N-S shortening across (and E-W stretching of) the Central Domain, and a roughly NNW shortening direction. This agrees with the interpretation by Archanjo et al. (2008), who pointed out the strong pure shear (N-S shortening) seen in the northern part of the Central Domain ESE of the town of Patos (Fig. 2c). It also agrees with shear zone data presented by Neves et al. (2012) from the SE Central Domain. Furthermore, several minor thrusts have been mapped and although their ages are not well constrained, they may be an expression of Neoproterozoic shortening (e.g., Neves et al., 2012; Silva and Neves, 2021). Regardless of the interpretation of the thrust, it is clear that the structural pattern observed in the Central Domain is different from the pattern north of the Patos shear zone, meaning that different domains accommodated strain in different ways.\n\n\n4.4\nThe Northern Domain\nThe aeromagnetic images show a more complex picture north of the Patos shear zone, and location and kinematics of shear zones are not as easily defined as in the Central Domain. This domain shows an overall NNE-SSW trend of fabrics and lithologic contacts, with a variation in planar structures from steep to low-angle. Field observations show that steep shear zones are strike-slip dominated, while there are also low-angle shear zones interpreted as thrusts or extensional shear zones (Archanjo et al., 2002). There are also basement domes that may have resulted from extensive partial melting in the Neoproterozoic, and extensional shear zones may be related to this doming process. Hence, we have supported the aeromagnetic image interpretation with field observations when compiling the shear zone map shown in Fig. 2c. This map shows multiple NNE-striking dextral shear zones and an additional conjugate NNW-striking set of sinistral zones. Kinematic criteria involved include numerous kinematic indicators such as porphyroclast systems, veins, shear bands and boudins, and map-scale asymmetric shape of syntectonic granite plutons (e.g., Archanjo and Bouchez, 1991; Trindade et al., 1999; Archanjo et al., 2002; Souza et al., 2006; Archanjo et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\n5.1\nShear zone geometry, displacement and kinematics\nThis study shows how interpretations of different enhancements of aeromagnetic data not commonly used by structural geology researchers (although more common in the mineral exploration industry), and enhanced pseudo-gravity data (derived from the same original aeromagnetic data), may be integrated to provide a wealth of additional structural information that complements field mapping of the Borborema shear system in NE Brazil. In addition to identifying or confirming shear zones and confidentially constraining their shear sense (particularly successful in the Central Domain), regional tight to isoclinal folds are identified in the Northern Domain using edge enhanced pseudo-gravity images (which are shown to be invaluable in defining deep domain boundaries and their geometry), where only a few minor folds appear in aeromagnetic images enhancing the upper crust. This interpretation is consistent with field observations of NNE-SSW striking dextral shear zones and thrusts (Fig. 2c). Aeromagnetic images portray spectacular examples of the range of fold styles, reorientation and superposition, producing a full spectrum of fold interference patterns establish by Ramsay (1967) at a regional scale similar to those observed at the outcrop and thin section scales, and produced in physical and numerical simulations (e.g., Grasemann et al., 2004).\nThe analyses presented here are consistent with an interpretation of the Patos-Pernambuco shear zone system as an enormous intracontinental dextral transcurrent shear system, where the exposed level developed at mid-crustal depths. We have employed classical shear zone theory to estimate the kinematics and strains related to the shear zones and find a consistent pattern of both dextral and sinistral zones. The Patos and Pernambuco shear zones show evidence of very high shear strains and accumulated lateral dextral offsets on the order of 200 and 350\u00a0km, respectively. These shear zones themselves must therefore be close to simple shear, as confirmed by very consistent asymmetry of internal shear zone structures. However, the domains between and outside of these two major shear zones show a different deformation style with two sets of conjugate shear zones.\nA particularly interesting feature in this respect is the many NE-striking sinistral antithetic shear zones in the Central Domain, and similarly oriented shear zones in the Northern Domain with opposite (dextral) kinematics. This alone implies a change in strain regime across the Patos shear zone. In the Northern Domain, field-based kinematic indicators show a combination of NE-striking dextral shear zones accompanied by N to NNW-striking sinistral shear zones (Fig. 2c), and together they indicate an ENE-WSW apparent shortening direction that is very different from that of the Central Domain (see rose diagrams in Fig. 2c). The orientations of these internal shear zones do not fit those of typical shear bands (C, C\u2032 or C\u2033) and suggest an influence of coaxial strain. The Southern Domain (south of the Pernambuco shear zone) also show shear zones with kinematics and orientations in agreement with a component of N-S shortening, similar to the Central Domain. We suggest from these observations that the Neoproterozoic deformation in the Borborema Province is participated into simple shear localized on the two major shear zones and more complex and overall lower vorticity-type deformation of a nature that differs between the Central and Northern domains.\nTo better constrain this strain partitioning and the deformation in general in the Borborema region, dating of individual shear zones is necessary. It is unlikely that all shear zones were active at the same time everywhere, and it is also unlikely that the far-field kinematic boundary conditions were stable over the ca. 50 million years of dextral shearing in this region. More work could also be done on constraining the pre-shearing rheologic structure, including the rift-related structures and how they influence the development of the Borborema shear zone system.\n\n\n5.2\nTectonic implications\nAltogether, following peak metamorphism between 650 and 590\u00a0Ma in the Central Domain Neves et al., 2015), more than 550\u00a0km of combined dextral shear is indicated during the Ediacaran. Based on AMS studies and radiometric dating, synkinematic plutons were emplaced between 585 and 571\u00a0Ma (Archanjo et al., 2998, 2013; Hollanda et al., 2010; \u00c1vila et al., 2020). Shearing appears to have peaked at around 590-560\u00a0Ma, but locally lasted into the Cambrian (Hollanda et al., 2010; Cioffi et al., 2021) when brittle reactivation resulted in the formation of pull-apart basins in which molasse sediments were deposited (\u00c1vila et al., 2020). Regionally the Brasiliano orogeny initiated with continental collisions around 640-630\u00a0Ma, following a prolonged period of rifting (Neves et al., 2015). The interpretation that the Pernambuco shear zone represents a reactivated rift boundary of such an Early Tonian pre-Brasiliano rift system (Neves et al., 2020) is supported by the total field pseudo-gravity image in Fig. 4a that is dominated by deep crustal features that may equate to rift margins. That this may also be the case for the Patos shear zone (Neves, 2018) is supported by the same pseudogravity image, and the continuity of some units from the Southern to Northern domains places doubt on the suture model presented for this structure (Brito Neves et al., 2016). In general, a model where the shear zones formed in response to Brasiliano\u2013Pan-African shortening of a rifted hot crust (Ganade et al., 2021) seems likely. Our observations fit the widely accepted model of lateral dextral shear primarily driven by an eastward push from the Amazon craton (Archanjo et al., 2021).\nOur structural interpretation shows that the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones accumulated approximately 350 and 200\u00a0km of lateral offset, respectively, through simple shear-dominated deformation, amounting to a total of ca. 550\u00a0km of lateral displacement between the Northern and Southern domains. In addition, the different domains that are delimited by the major shear zones deformed in different ways, reflecting complex deformation partitioning at the 100-km scale. The difference in deformation between the Central and Northern domains suggest a more complex deformation pattern than the rotational extrusion model presented by Ganade de Araujo et al. (2014b), who also assign an undocumented sinistral movement to the NNE-striking dextral shear zones in the Northern Domain west of the Serid\u00f3 belt to fit their model (their Fig. 4). Although more work is needed to better understand the strain patterns portrayed in this work, particularly through dating of shear zone activity in this complex shear zone array, we have shown how aeromagnetic data can contribute to map and interpret the Neoproterozoic deformation of this and similar regions of variable ductile crustal deformation.\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nHaakon Fossen: Conceptualization, Investigation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

Collecting structural data, as well as the graphical representation of the structures and their interpretation, using geological mapping techniques, remote sensing, etc., are the first steps to be taken when studying natural structures in the field, especially mesoscopic- and macroscopic-scale structures, the ones that concern us here. Similarly to the rest of scientific disciplines, these geological techniques have not been alien to technical advances in society, but have benefited from them and this has allowed a remarkable scientific improvement of Structural Geology over time. Advances have taken place on many fronts. Thus, in the early days of Structural Geology, for instance, only field data collected in situ were available, which were reflected in drawings made manually in a field notebook. The advances in the Earth visualization gave a great impulse to Structural Geology both in terms of representing structural data and to obtain additional data; thus, nowadays extremely accurate topographic maps, aerial photographs, orthophotographs, satellite images, digital elevation models (DEM), and Google Earth and Street View images are available. The instruments that structural geologists use to carry out fieldwork have also undergone an enormous change from analog compasses to compasses capable of storing data, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), mobile phones and tablets, and from conventional photographic cameras to digital cameras and laser scanners. It goes without saying that computers have been a huge leap for society. In the field of Structural Geology, they initially allowed graphical representations of structures using drawing software packages with the advantages that this entailed, but later, powerful hardware and specific software have been available for the representation and interpretation of structures, as well as for the management and processing of large amounts of structural data, such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), numerical modelling software, etc. This continuous process of improvement over time has undergone significant leaps at certain times. Deciding which have been the most notable improvements is probably subjective and surely depends on the personal view of each one influenced by his research lines. As an example, we can mention an important step forward for Structural Geology in the sixties due to the quantification of parameters derived from the analysis of photogeological interpretations and geological sections across natural structures lead by the work of John G. Ramsay in 1967. From our point of view, the most important leap in the last decades has been the move from the 2D study of structures to have 3D data accompanied by digital support. Computer-assisted, three-dimensional techniques have become enormously popular in recent times.\nThe rise of these techniques has led to the creation of virtual outcrop models (VOM) all over the world (e.g., Xu et al., 2000). See for instance the open-access online repositories of VOMs called eRock (https:\/\/www.e-rock.co.uk) (Cawood and Bond, 2019) or Virtual 3D Geoscience (https:\/\/v3geo.com) (Buckley et al., 2021). Some regions of the planet have a large number of VOMs, while others are quite the opposite despite the growing expansion of these techniques. The north-northwest of the Iberian Peninsula corresponds to the latter case, although the creation of VOMs would be especially useful because it is a mountainous region with difficult access areas and where some outcrops are difficult to visualize because they are located in steep slopes (Fig. 1\n). The rainfall index recorded in the north-northwest of the Iberian Peninsula makes that many rock outcrops are covered by vegetation and soils, however, there are two sectors within this region where spectacular outcrops occur. The first of these areas is the coast, where high cliffs adjacent to the beaches occur because the submarine abrasion platform was raised in relatively recent times revealing spectacular outcrops (e.g., Flor, 1983; Mary, 1983). The second area is the Cantabrian Mountains (e.g., Alonso et al., 1996), that are roughly parallel to the coast and whose southern slope, adjacent to the central Spanish Plateau, exhibits an appropriate climate to preserve the outcrops. The tectonics suffered by this region gave rise to two main structural units (Fig. 1): the Cantabrian Zone, which is the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Variscan orogen of Palaeozoic age (Lotze, 1945; Julivert et al., 1972), and the Asturian Basin, a Permian-Mesozoic extensional basin inverted during the Alpine orogeny of Cenozoic age (e.g., Garc\u00eda-Ramos and Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol, 1995) that gave rise to the Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. Thus, this complex structural history makes the north-northwest portion of the Iberian Peninsula an exceptional natural laboratory made up of very different types of structures. We will show here an inventory of available VOMs of structures in this region (Fig. 1); they correspond to different examples of Variscan contractional structures and also to different types of Mesozoic extensional structures reactivated as reverse structures during the Alpine event. All the outcrops shown correspond to regions located on steep slopes prone to rock fall, inaccessible areas or regions only visible during low tide periods. Some of these models are shown and described here for the first time, while new descriptions are offered for others previously presented. Since these models were created employing different digital techniques, such as photogrammetry, VOMs, orthophotographs and stereoscopical pairs of photographs, together with conventional and digital mapping, we will explain the general guidelines used and the results obtained. We would like to make it clear that this work is not intended to be an exhaustive review of all the digital techniques, but rather to present the models available up to now, describe them and explain the various procedures employed to build them introducing a few technical innovations.\n\n\n2\nMethodology employed\n\n2.1\nDigital and \u201ctraditional\u201d fieldwork\nNowadays, there are two different ways to collect data from outcropping structures: digital techniques and traditional methods. From our point of view, digital fieldwork has got some advantages over traditional fieldwork, however, it has also got some disadvantages. The strong points are: a) faster data acquisition; b) easier positioning of the collected data (at least in areas with good GPS coverage); c) ability to carry multiple types of supports such as maps, orthophotographs, etc.; and d) seamless transfer of field data to software back in the laboratory to backup and update older versions of maps. The most remarkable drawbacks are: a) some electronic devices provide good orientation and location measurements while others do not, b) excessive light on sunny days makes the screen of many mobile phones or tablets difficult to read, c) the electronic devices must be adequately waterproof protected in the event of heavy rains and\/or fall into the water, d) the breakage of the mobile phone or tablet may cause the loss of the collected data, e) satellite coverage is poor in lush forests and in the lower part of steep slopes so that the location data provided by the mobile phones or tablets are not reliable, f) electronic devices must be periodically calibrated using an analog compass to ensure that the measurements are correct, and g) electronic devices are strongly conditioned by the duration of the batteries.\nIrrespective of the types, features and scales of the studied structures, we carried out traditional fieldwork to collect new data as input data for the virtual models presented below. Fieldwork was also helpful to refine and improve the accuracy of the elements mapped in the laboratory and to check the results obtained from the digital techniques described in the following sections.\nTo improve the data collection procedure, as well as the process of integrating field data with data obtained in the laboratory, we collected field data using mobile phones and tablets (e.g., Allmendinger et al., 2017; Novakova and Pavlis, 2017, 2019) running a field-oriented application such as FieldMove (https:\/\/www.petex.com\/products\/move-suite\/digital-field-mapping\/), which can be downloaded for free, and ArcPad (https:\/\/www.esri.com\/content\/dam\/esrisites\/sitecore-archive\/Files\/Pdfs\/library\/brochures\/pdfs\/arcpadbro.pdf). These devices were used in combination with a high precision GPS when we thought the location data provided by our mobile phones or tablets were not sufficiently accurate. FieldMove and ArcPad allowed us to store in the mobile phones and tablets all sorts of information such as geographical coordinates, as well as dips and strikes, of stratigraphic contacts, faults, fold elements, etc. The collected data were imported into different types of supports such as aerial photographs, Google Earth images, VOMs, etc., using general software such as GIS, and more specific software such as an academic license of Move (https:\/\/www.petex.com\/products\/move-suite\/), although other software with similar functionalities such as Andino 3D (https:\/\/www.andino3d.com.ar) may be used.\n\n\n2.2\nGoogle Earth\nTwo digital methods used to map large-scale structures are: the stereoscopic visualization of pairs of aerial and\/or satellite photographs and their photogeological interpretation using specific software (e.g., Berger et al., 1992; Dueholm et al., 1993), and remote geological mapping from orthophotographs draped over DEM's managed using GIS software (e.g., Banerjee and Mitra 2004; Dhont et al., 2005). These two methods provide excellent results but do not seem to be the most widely used methods today. Anyway, these methods can be used in a complementary way to the most popular method nowadays which is Google Earth (https:\/\/www.google.com\/earth\/) (e.g., Lisle, 2006; Blenkinsop, 2012; Tavani et al., 2014; Mart\u00edn et al., 2019; Wellmann et al., 2019). The main advantages of Google Earth with respect to the methods mentioned above are: a) Google Earth does not require the use of specific software for image visualization and\/or interpretation because it provides its own free software; b) Google Earth has images of the entire planet for free, and therefore, there is no need to search for aerial photographs, orthophotographs, satellite images or DEM's of the region to be studied, difficult and\/or expensive to get in some places; c) there is no need to worry about the scale of the photographs, orthophotographs, satellite images or DEM's as Google Earth allows zooming in and out the images without quality loss unless detailed images of small outcrops are needed; and d) Google Earth allows sharing the information easily. Thus, this set of reasons led us to use Google Earth.\nThe interpretation of geological structures using Google Earth was carried out employing elements implemented in this software such as linear features (e.g., intersection of lithological contacts with the topographic surface, fold and fault traces, lineaments), polygons (e.g., regions where a particular rock unit crops out, fault-damage zones) and points (e.g., dip\/strike data, position of geological sketches and photographs) (Fig. 2\nb). All these elements were exported as kml files and loaded in a GIS software to create geological maps. One drawback derived from the geological interpretations carried out using Google Earth was that they lack altitude information, which was not a problem for generating maps, but limited its use, for instance, to calculate dips and strikes of bedding, faults, etc. This problem was overcome using auxiliary tools such as the free, online applications GPS Visualizer (https:\/\/www.gpsvisualizer.com) and KML Altitude Filler (https:\/\/www.nearby.org.uk\/elevation-kml.php) that, amongst other aspects, allowed calculating altitudes for kml files exported from Google Earth. Another solution we carried out was building a VOM using images and points of known coordinates extracted from Google Earth (e.g., Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). The procedure of constructing and interpreting a VOM derived from Google Earth images is described below.\nThe use of Google Earth is an excellent technique, however, we needed better resolutions, better points of view and more powerful zoom in\/out factors than the ones provided by Google Earth to study mesoscopic geological structures developed in inaccessible areas. Due to these reasons, we used the additional digital techniques described below.\n\n\n2.3\nVOMs\nNowadays, 3D photorealistic VOMs are probably the most commonly used approaches to analyse outcrops from the geological point of view (e.g., Xu et al., 2000, 2001; Buckley et al., 2008; Hodgetts, 2013). The acquisition of the required data can be made by employing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)\/terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) (e.g., Pringle et al., 2004; Bellian et al., 2005; Trinks et al., 2005; McCaffrey et al., 2010) or, alternatively, using photogrammetry (e.g., Bemis et al., 2014; Svennevig et al., 2015; Corradetti et al., 2017; S\u00f8rensen and Dueholm, 2018; S\u00f8rensen and Guarnieri, 2018; Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). We used the latter technique to create our VOMs because it is cheaper. Thus, the first method requires sophisticated devices, whereas the second can be carried out with commonly available devices such as photographic cameras and computers amongst others. Below we describe the practices we carried out for collecting the necessary data, as well as building and interpreting the VOMs.\n\n2.3.1\nPhotogrammetry data collection\nTo generate our VOMs we used the structure from motion (Sfm) photogrammetry (Carrivick et al., 2016 and references therein), which is a relatively quick and unexpensive technique, and one of the most widely used. In the case of large-scale structures, we saved in our computer different Google Earth images to cover the area of interest (Fig. 2b). On the contrary, in the case of smaller-scale structures, we took several photographs using photographic cameras mounted on tripods for ground-based studies (Figs. 3a, 4b, 5b, 6a, 7c and 8\nb\n\n\n\n) and\/or attached to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, drones) (Fig. 9\na). UAVs were used when the outcrop met certain particularities such as: a) relatively large area to cover, as flying was faster than walking and, in some cases, recording a video at high frames per second (fps) rates and extracting selected frames was good enough for building a VOM (Li et al., 2018); b) outcrops whose geometry could only be properly captured from the air, such as vertical or steeply inclined cliffs and slopes whose height did not allow correct coverage photographing from ground level, or studies that required a top-down view of the terrain because the plunge of the structures was oblique to the topographic surface; and\/or c) areas with environmental hazards, such as falling of rocks, slippery floor, etc., where getting close to the outcrop was not safe. Ground-based studies were used when: a) the outcrop to be simulated was relatively small; b) minor structures such as small veins, joints, cracks, etc. needed to be captured and handheld cameras yielded better pictures of these minor structures in terms of sharpness, resolution and contrast than cameras mounted on UAV's; c) the outcrop had relatively low relief, it was accessible and hiking was easy and safe, and therefore, it was easier to get close enough to the outcrop walking than piloting an UAV; and\/or d) the outcrop was located in an area where flying was prohibited or fly permits were hard to get, such as restricted flying zones, or especially difficult because of climatological and\/or topographical conditions.\nThe first and most important step was to cover the whole area of interest with enough images. The main issues we took into account when taking images from Google Earth or photographing the outcrop in the field using UAVs or tripods were: a) overlapping between pictures and b) minimizing shadowed areas. As a rule of thumb, the more overlapping the better accuracy, but also the longer computing time. Consequently, a compromise was reached between these two factors (Torres-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2017). To ensure an appropriate coverage, we took photographs of the outcrops along \u201cscanlines\u201d varying the distance and orientation of the scanlines with respect to the outcrop. Another successful practice was to take several pictures facing different directions from each shooting point.\n\n\n2.3.2\nVOM creation\nAll the photographs gathered in the field were prepared before creating the VOM.\nRegarding the photograph selection, not all the photographs taken were necessary to create the VOM. Thus, some photographs, that were redundant, were discarded to make the computing process faster. Later on, more photographs were added to improve the VOM when the initial result was not satisfactory or blank areas arose.\nRegarding the photograph enhancement, we applied photographic filters implemented in the software Adobe Photoshop (https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/es\/products\/photoshop.html) to increment the contrast, brightness, colour balance and\/or saturation to improve the photograph quality, homogenize the pictures and to speed up the process. Other techniques, such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, were used to improve photographs including very lightened areas entwined with shaded zones, which usually happened when the photographs included both outcrop and sky. When the camera was not equipped with HDR as standard, we used the free software Photomatix (https:\/\/www.hdrsoft.com) to combine a number of shots for each image (typically between three and five) taken with different shutter values. This was an issue when many pictures were required to create the VOM and also when we used an UAV under windy conditions that affected its stability.\nToday there are many personal applications and online applications capable of building 3D models from 2D photographs, some of which work fully automatically. However, we employed an academic license of the software Pix4DMapper (https:\/\/www.pix4d.com\/product\/pix4dmapper-photogrammetry-software) and the free software VisualSfM (http:\/\/ccwu.me\/vsfm) (Wu, 2013) to create the VOMs using the data collected in the field and pre-processed in the laboratory. Regarding VisualSfM, this software follows the Sfm system developed by Wu et al. (2011) (see Carrivick et al., 2016 for a compendium of some applications of Sfm in Earth Sciences), and sorts out both the intrinsic (camera calibration: calculations of focal length, projection centre and radial distortion) and the extrinsic (resection: determining the camera positions for each photograph) calibrations. To carry out these corrections, the software uses the bundle adjustment method (Triggs et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2011), with automatic detection of matching points using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. VisualSfM is also able to load the corresponding parameters and set a fixed calibration if the camera had been calibrated before, which we did for some outcrops. In order to create the point cloud, we ran sparse reconstruction first, so that the bundle adjustment step used multicore bundle adjustment automatically. Subsequently, we carried out a dense reconstruction by using the Patch-based Multi-view Stereo Software (PMVS2) (http:\/\/www.di.ens.fr\/pmvs\/), which is included in the Clustering Views for Multiview Stereo Software package (CMVS) (https:\/\/www.di.ens.fr\/cmvs\/), developed by Y. Furukawa and J. Ponce. This free software grouped the images into manageable packages to make a more exhaustive search, instead of working with all of them at the same time which would be much more expensive from the computational point of view. The package image grouping is based on the previous reconstruction using the bundle adjustment. When working with relatively heavy models we carried out one or more of the following actions: a) down-sample the point cloud for large-scale interpretation when not so much detail was needed using the software Move, b) divide the point cloud into smaller portions to be analysed independently using the software Move, and c) delete areas without interest using initially the software VisualSfm for larger-scale regions and later the software Move for more detailed deleting. From the dense point cloud, the software was also able to generate a triangular textured mesh (Figs. 3a, 4b and 8a). Triangulated textured meshes helped to visualize outcrops, especially when the resulting point clouds were not dense enough. However, in some cases they induced to errors, for instance, when trying to calculate plane orientations by selecting points on the cloud as they simplified the topography or created incorrect connections between the nodes (H\u00f6fle et al., 2009; Lindberg et al., 2013; Cawood et al., 2017). Thus, we always saved the original point cloud as a source since interpolated models may lead to wrong results (Otepka et al., 2013).\n\n\n2.3.3\nVOM georeferencing\nIn the case of VOMs derived from UAV's, the images were georeferenced using their internal GPS. Although the x and y coordinates were accurate, some UAV's yielded errors in the z coordinate. These errors were corrected because the altitude of known points in the studied region was available.\nIn the case of VOMs constructed using photographic cameras mounted on a tripod, if the camera has an integrated GPS, then the VOM is automatically georeferenced. However, our cameras did not have an integrated GPS. Thus, both the VOMs constructed from photographs taken with cameras in the field and from Google Earth images, required georeferencing to perform quantitative geological analyses because their orientation and size were somewhat arbitrary, i.e., they were not correctly positioned, oriented and scaled. The key issue in this case was the acquisition of georeferenced points in the field and on the Google Earth images that were divided in: a) ground control points (GCP), used to georeference the VOM; and b) check points, left out of the VOM building procedure and employed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model. Georeferencing a point cloud\/mesh requires a minimum of 3 non-linear points, however, in the case of some models that required a lot of detail and\/or the mean error was too high, more points were needed (Harwin and Lucieer, 2012; Ag\u00fcera-Vega et al., 2016; Gindraux et al., 2017; Oniga et al., 2018). The software VisualSfM informed when enough points had been introduced to calculate the required rotation, translation and scaling. Regarding the check points, they were arranged more or less uniformly throughout the whole area of interest and at different depths of view, although zones with less photograph coverage\/overlapping were prioritized. Georeferenced points were obtained using a total station and a high precision GPS which were rented for a low cost. A simpler and cheaper solution to acquire georeferenced points consists of using a laser rangefinder, a compass and a laser level (Tavani et al., 2016), however we did not use this solution because it is slightly less accurate. The point-to-point comparison, done manually, was the method employed to assess the accuracy of the resulting VOMs and estimate their error (Fonstad et al., 2013).\nIn those cases where global coordinates were not necessary, for instance, when the study was focused on a single outcrop and its position with respect to adjacent outcrops was not required, an alternative method was used to extract quantitative information. First of all, we found out surfaces easily identifiable in the field and in the VOM such as bedding, fractures and\/or other surfaces. After that, the orientations of these surfaces were measured in the field using a compass and the orientation of the same elements was measured in the \u201craw\u201d VOM. By calculating the transformation matrix that converts the orientation of the VOM planes into planes with the same orientation than the actual ones and applying it to the point cloud we reorientated the model. To rescale the model, lengths of different elements such as bed thicknesses, fracture spacing and\/or distances between other elements were measured in the field using a tape measure and their values compared to the same distances in the VOM to estimate a scale factor to correct the VOM size. In order to obtain good results, we measured dips and strikes of surfaces with different orientations located at different points within the outcrop, and we measured lengths of different magnitudes along different orientations. The reorientation and rescaling of the VOM was carried out using an in-house software but it may be done using the software Move.\n\n\n2.3.4\nVOM interpretation\nThe resulting VOM, either as a point cloud or as a textured triangular mesh, can be interpreted from the geological point of view using a Computer Assisted Virtual Environment (CAVE) and shutting glasses or using a PC\/Workstation with optional devices such as virtual reality headsets (Figs. 2c, 3b and 4c, 5c, 6b, 7d, 8c, 9b and 10\nc). To do so, we employed the in-house software 3D Stereo VDT (Mart\u00edn et al., 2019) for CAVE, as well as Move and VGRS (http:\/\/www.vgeoscience.com) that run in a PC. The abundant tools to draw lines, polygons and points of different colours, to zoom in and out and to rotate the VOMs, and even to carry out measurements such as distances, make all these software powerful tools, which allowed us to carry out complete geological interpretations. We first interpreted faults and then horizons in different parts of the outcrop and extended the interpretations until they reached each other to tie the geological interpretation, and we also used data, diagrams and photographs taken in the field to constrain the VOMs interpretation.\n\n\n\n2.4\nAdditional photogrammetric techniques\n\n2.4.1\nOrthophotogeological interpretations\nFrom the original photographs taken in the field to construct some of the VOMs and\/or from some of the resulting VOMs, we created orthomosaics that were rectified to build orthophotographs (Tavani et al., 2016) with any desired orientation. This was done employing the software Pix4DMapper, which produced good quality orthophotographs (Figs. 3b and 9b).\nWhen the orthophotographs were generated from field photographs, they were interpreted from the geological point of view using drawing packages such as Adobe Illustrator (https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/es\/products\/illustrator.html) and the free software Inkscape (https:\/\/inkscape.org\/es\/). This allowed us to obtain orthophotogeological interpretations, i.e., intersections of geological contacts between stratigraphic units, faults, etc. with the topographic surface in which all the elements have the same scale, and therefore, they are free of errors and deformations.\nWhen VOMs interpreted from the geological point of view were available, the process of obtaining orthophotogeological interpretations was carried out as follows. The VOM-derived orthophotographs obtained using Pix4DMapper were scaled, but not georeferenced, except for the zenith orthophotographs that were georeferenced. In the case of orthophotographs not georeferenced, first, we managed to georeference the orthophotographs using the software Move and points of known coordinates. Then the geological interpretations of the VOMs were projected using the same direction employed to construct the orthophotographs and to the same plane using the software Move. Eventually they were overlapped onto the orthophotographs using in-house software to create orthophotogeological interpretations.\n\n\n2.4.2\nGeological interpretation of stereoscopical pairs of photographs\nThe employment of this technique required five basic steps: a) photograph acquisition, b) control points acquisition, c) intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, d) photograph rectification, and e) geological interpretation.\nTo photograph the outcrop, we followed some basic rules in order to ensure good quality pictures (Fig. 10b). For instance, we used cameras with fixed-focus lens, whose calibration tends to remain more stable during the whole project and have less optical deformation. Moreover, the pictures were taken with large depths of field to ensure a sharp vision of all the image and, preferably, as HDR images to avoid strong illumination contrasts, i.e., dark and bright areas coexisting. The camera was mounted on a tripod to prevent blurry results. Each stereopair was taken independently, trying to keep the camera looking at the same direction, perpendicular to the outcrop, and moving the camera as parallel as possible to the outcrop face. In general, as it could be expected, the width and height resolutions, i.e., the pixel size of the outcrop, depended on the camera resolution as well as on the distance to the outcrop from the shooting point. The larger the distance, the lower the resolution. The resolution in depth, i.e., parallel to the shooting direction, depended on the two parameters mentioned above, but it was also controlled by the baseline, which is the distance between the two positions of the camera. In general, the larger the displacement, the smaller the uncertainty and, as a consequence, the better the resolution. However, large displacements implied less overlapping between photographs, which meant more stereoscopical pairs of photographs for each area. We tried to find a balance between the voxel size, i.e., the resolution in xyz, and the number of stereoscopical pairs needed.\nAs is the case of other techniques described above, georeferencing the stereopairs required capturing control points in the field. Theoretically three control points per pair were enough, however, we took about eight points. The reader is referred to a section above to find out how these points were acquired.\nTwo calibrations were needed to work with stereopairs of photographs: intrinsic and extrinsic. The former consists of getting the actual focal, centre of projection and distortion coefficients of the camera. This required taking a series of photographs from different positions of a rectangular chessboard pattern and loading them in Stereo Rectification, an in-house software based on the OpenCV library (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008). The latter, also called resection, allowed knowing the relative position of the camera at the shooting moments. To do this, the controls points were used in combination with the same in-house software mentioned above. Before interpreting the stereopairs, the images were rectified by reprojecting the image planes of the two camera positions, so that they fell in the exact same plane, i.e., epipolar configuration.\nThe visualization of the stereo pairs of photographs and their geological interpretation were carried out using Visage, an in-house software for personal computers (Mart\u00edn et al., 2007) based on the open-source library GLSVe (Mart\u00edn et al., 2011). This software required the use shutter glasses and allowed drawing polylines to represent different geological elements.\n\n\n\n2.5\nDeliverables\nDifferent types of information were extracted from the VOMs, orthophotographs and stereoscopical pairs of photographs, which are briefly described below.\n\n2.5.1\nStratigraphic data\nIn this section we briefly describe different procedures used to obtain stratigraphic data (Fig. 9b) necessary to create the structural models.\nFirst, we selected points on bedding surfaces of different layers from base to top in the VOM and obtained their x, y and z coordinates, using the tools implemented in the software 3D Stereo VDT, Move or VGRS. Then we estimated the dip and strike of the layers in the VOM (the procedure to estimate these values is explained below) or used the values measured in the field. Finally, we calculated orthogonal true thicknesses using a script for Python developed by ourselves or manually. This relatively easy method helped to create stratigraphic logs for inaccessible areas as it only required picking points on the bedding surfaces and estimating their dips. The thickness measurements performed in different parts of the outcrop were compared to decipher whether the stratigraphic thickness was constant or variable.\nThe orthophotographs were used as auxiliary tools to help establishing stratigraphic correlations from one edge to the other of several outcrops and refine the structural models. Thus, using the software Adobe Photoshop, portions of orthophotographs showing characteristic strata sequences were cropped, moved and overlaid on images from other areas and\/or fault blocks to compare both stratigraphic sequences.\n\n\n2.5.2\nStructural data\nThe different types of measurements from the structural point of view that we carried out are: orientations, number of times an element was repeated and distances. The orientation of planar elements, such as bedding, unconformities, faults and joints, fold limbs and fold axial surfaces, and that of linear elements, such as fold axes and intersection between beds and unconformities, were obtained by identifying points along these elements in the VOMs, obtaining their x, y and z coordinates using the software 3D Stereo VDT, Move or VGRS, and fitting the points to a plane or line employing the software Move (Banerjee and Mitra, 2004; Fern\u00e1ndez, 2005 amongst others). A minimum of three points are necessary in the case of planes, while a line can be defined using only two points.\nThe interpretation of the VOMs also allowed making a fast assessment of parameters such as fracture density as it was relatively simple and quick to draw fractures in the model, draw a scanline across the fractures, count the fractures that intersect the scanline and divide the resulting number by the scanline length.\nIn addition, measurement of distances such as fault displacement, width of faulted zones, structural relief of a fold and fold wavelength were easily carried out using the tools for length measurements implemented in the software 3D Stereo VDT, Move and VGRS. Alternatively, these measurements were used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the VOMs because once these values were obtained, they were manually compared to values measured directly in the field. See Mart\u00edn et al. (2013, 2019) and Uzkeda et al. (2013, 2018) for further information on structural results obtained from some of the VOMs shown here.\n\n\n2.5.3\n3D geological models\nOnce the most important geological elements on a VOM, such as bedding, unconformities, faults and fold axial surfaces were mapped, we built 3D geological models using the software Move. The procedure employed is briefly described below. We usually started by creating the fault framework and work in each fault block independently. Thus, close points belonging to each horizon were fit to a surface and its dip and strike were calculated, and each portion of surface was extended along strike according to the dip and strike calculated. After that, different 3D dip domains (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004), in which the dip of the layers was approximately constant, were defined by drawing the axial surfaces corresponding to the boundaries between dip domains. Finally, we interpolated and extrapolated portions of mapped stratigraphic horizons within each dip domain honouring the bedding orientation and the bed thickness. Once the 3D geological model was built, the axial surfaces that bounded the dip domains were erased. We refer the readers to Mart\u00edn et al. (2019) and Uzkeda et al. (2018) for 3D geological models derived from some of the VOMs shown here.\n\n\n2.5.4\nGeological maps and cross-sections\nOther useful results derived from the use of digital techniques are geological maps (Fig. 9b) and cross-sections (Figs. 2c, 4c, 5c, 6b, 7d, 8c and 10c). We used two different ways to generate them briefly described below.\nIf a 3D geological model had been built, geological maps were constructed by intersecting the interpreted geological surfaces with the topography (Fig. 9b). When outcrops had cantilevers, i.e., overhanging rocks, there were portions of the outcrop that had the same x and y coordinates but different z coordinates. Only those portions of the outcrop closest to the horizontal plane used to construct the map were considered. Geological cross-sections were generated by intersecting the interpreted geological surfaces with a vertical, or inclined plane of a chosen orientation (Figs. 7d and 8c). Both geological maps and cross-sections were easily constructed using the tools implemented in the software Move.\nAnother option consists of projecting the geological interpretation carried out on a VOM, orthophotograph or stereoscopical pairs of photographs onto a horizontal plane following a vertical direction in the case of geological maps, or onto a vertical or inclined plane following geologically meaningful directions such as fold axes, strikes of beds, etc. in the case of geological cross-sections (Figs. 2c, 4c, 5c, 6b and 10c). In the case of maps, we removed the z coordinate from the lines representing geological features. In the case of cross sections, this operation was carried out using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/microsoft-365\/excel), specific scripts developed for Phyton and the software Move. This procedure consisted of applying a trigonometric formula to the known x, y and z coordinates of each point belonging to each of the interpreted surfaces (bedding, unconformities, fractures, etc.) in order to obtain the new coordinates on the chosen cross section plane.\nThe second option revealed to be faster, as it does not require to build surfaces to construct a 3D geological model, and more suitable for essentially \u201cflat\u201d outcrops such as cliff faces or road trenches, while the first method resulted to be more efficient in the case of outcrops with salients and recesses.\n\n\n\n\n3\nGeological setting\nThe virtual outcrops presented here involve carbonate rocks of Devonian and Carboniferous age, and of Jurassic age. The Palaeozoic rocks, affected mainly by folds and thrusts, belong to the Cantabrian Zone, the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Variscan orogen in northwest Iberia developed in Carboniferous times (Fig. 1). This orogen displays an arcuate orocline shape known as Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arch (Lotze, 1945). The contractional mountain range developed during the Variscan orogeny was dismantled by an erosive episode. After that, a Permian-Triassic rift responsible for normal faults, in some cases resulting from reactivation of previous Variscan structures (Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990), propitiated the Asturian basin origin (Fig. 1). The subsequent thermal subsidence event during Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, was followed by an extensional stage that lasted from the end of Early Jurassic until the beginning of Late Jurassic and consisted of development of normal faults, reactivation of previous ones, heating and uplift (Uzkeda et al., 2016). From the Late Jurassic to the lower part of the Early Cretaceous (pre-Barremian) another extensional event caused the reactivation of previous normal faults (Alonso et al., 2018). This episode was related to the rift responsible for the Bay of Biscay opening. From middle Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous, a thermal subsidence episode occurred. Convergence between the Iberian and Eurasian tectonic plates during the middle-late part of the Eocene to the beginning of the Miocene (\u00c1lvarez\u2010Marr\u00f3n et al., 1997; Gallastegui, 2000) caused the Alpine orogeny. This contractional event, responsible for the Cantabrian Mountains formation, involved selective reactivation of previous structures, generation of new thrusts and uplift (Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990; Pulgar et al., 1999; Alonso et al., 2009; Uzkeda et al., 2016). The structural framework constructed during this contractional event was exhumed during the late part of the Eocene to the beginning of the Oligocene (Fillon et al., 2016), making visible the outcrops in the southern slope of the mountains presented here. During Early Pleistocene or before (\u00c1lvarez-Marr\u00f3n et al., 2008) a narrow coastal strip of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks were eroded, unconformably covered by Quaternary sediments and uplifted above the present-day sea level (e.g., Flor, 1983; Mary, 1983). The emergence of the coastal area, from which various VOMs presented here have been obtained, was accompanied by neotectonic activity such as faulting (e.g., Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol et al., 2006; \u00c1lvarez-Marr\u00f3n et al., 2008) and small magnitude earthquakes (e.g., L\u00f3pez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004).\n\n\n4\nNorth-Northwest Iberia VOMs\n\n4.1\nCantabrian Zone\nThe Cantabrian Zone is the foreland fold-and-thrust belt of the Northwest-Iberia Variscan Orogen developed during Carboniferous times (Lotze, 1945; Julivert et al., 1972) (Fig. 1). The Cantabrian Zone involves a Palaeozoic stratigraphic succession from Cambrian to Carboniferous, made up of both siliciclastic (slates, sandstones and microconglomerates) and carbonate (marls, limestones and dolomites) sedimentary rocks with sporadic coal beds and volcanic rocks. This zone developed under diagenetic conditions although some localities reached very low or low-grade metamorphism. It is a typical thin-skinned belt, constituted by different types of thrust systems and folds, where tectonic foliations are lacking except for small areas (e.g., Julivert, 1971, 1983; Savage, 1979, 1981; P\u00e9rez-Esta\u00fan et al., 1988; P\u00e9rez-Esta\u00fan and Bastida, 1990; Aller et al., 2004). In cross section, the Cantabrian Zone exhibits a wedge geometry thinning eastwards, i.e., towards the foreland. In map view, it displays a curved trend around an approximately E\u2013W axial surface with the core to the east, known as Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc.\n\n4.1.1\nCacabillo\nThe Cacabillo outcrop is located in the almost inaccessible slope of a valley near the Cacabillo village, in the southwestern portion of the Cantabrian Zone close to the core of the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc, where NW\u2013SE trending structures predominate (Fig. 1). The outcrop is located in the hinge zone of the several kilometres long Cacabillo anticline (Navarro-V\u00e1zquez and Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez, 1978), also known as Puerto de Somiedo anticline (Bastida et al., 1984) (Fig. 2a). This anticline is a NW\u2013SE trending, tight fold with a subvertical axial surface. A subvertical, NW\u2013SE trending fault of small displacement in the core of the Cacabillo\/Puerto de Somiedo anticline separates the southwest limb from the hinge and the northeast limb. This anticline, mapped in Navarro-V\u00e1zquez and Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez (1978), Bastida et al. (1984), Alonso et al. (1989) and Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014), involves an Ordovician-Carboniferous succession (Fig. 2a) and was developed during the Variscan orogeny.\nA VOM was created using georeferenced Google Earth images (Fig. 2b), and an undistorted geological cross-section was constructed by projecting the geological interpretation of the VOM onto a selected plane (Fig. 2c). Below is a description of the outcrop derived from the VOM geological interpretation and from the cross section.\nThe rocks shown in the virtual outcrop belong to two Devonian stratigraphic units according to the available geological maps and sections (Navarro-V\u00e1zquez et al., 1982). The upper unit, the Santa Luc\u00eda Fm., is a limestone unit with sparse marls and slates, whereas the lower unit, La Vid Gr., is mainly made up of dolostones, slates, limestones and marls. The grey layers that stand out in the relief correspond to the limestones of the Santa Lucia Fm., while the lower regions where layers are hardly recognized correspond to La Vid Gr. (Fig. 2b and c). The outcrop consists of a fold train formed by two anticlines and two synclines whose dimensions reach hundreds of meters. The limbs of each fold dip towards opposite senses and the axial surfaces are subvertical. Several planar faults, whose displacement can reach a hundred meters, cut and offset the folds; in particular, they are well developed in the southwest limbs of the folds and dip in opposite sense to that of the limbs. Folded thrusts, responsible for the repetition of some beds within the Santa Lucia Fm., have also been identified. These thrusts develop flats in most of their trajectory, although some ramps are recognized, especially near the hinge of the anticline located to the northeast. These folds and faults are second-order structures developed in the hinge of the larger-scale Cacabillo\/Puerto de Somiedo anticline, which contribute to its thickening. We refer the reader to Mart\u00edn et al. (2019) for more information on the features of this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n4.1.2\nLas Palomas\nThis outcrop, located on the steep slope of a local road near Las Palomas bridge, belongs to the southwestern portion of the Cantabrian Zone close to the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc core, where NW\u2013SE trending structures are common (Fig. 1). The outcrop is located in the southwest limb of the kilometre-scale Vega de Los Viejos syncline (Navarro-V\u00e1zquez et al., 1982), a tight, NW-SE trending syncline whose axial surface is subvertical (Fig. 2a). This large syncline, developed during the Variscan orogeny, involves an Ordovician-Carboniferous succession, and its southwestern limb is unconformable covered by Uppermost Carboniferous deposits as shown in the geological maps and sections by Navarro-V\u00e1zquez and Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez (1978), Bastida et al. (1984), Alonso et al. (1989) and Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) (Fig. 2a).\nA VOM was created from pictures taken in the field with a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, an orthophotograph derived from the VOM was geologically interpreted in order to obtain a geological cross section (Fig. 3c). A description of the outcrop, based on the visualization and geological interpretation of the VOM, orthophotograph and cross section, is presented in the next paragraph.\nThe rocks displayed in the virtual outcrop are limestones that belong to the Barcaliente Fm. of Carboniferous age according to Navarro-V\u00e1zquez et al. (1982) (Fig. 3a and b). The outcrop is formed by a train of metre-scale folds. In general, the axial surfaces of the folds dip steeply to the NE and the limbs of most folds dip towards opposite directions. There is a thick, competent limestone layer the middle part of the stratigraphic succession. Below this layer, the limestones are thinly bedded, while above it they have an intermediate thickness in between that of the thinly bedded layers and that of the thick layer. This competent layer behaves differently from the over- and underlying layers and in turn it is the boundary between mechanically different behaviours. Thus, this layer gives rise to a box syncline and a box anticline in the central part of the outcrop. The beds above this limestone layer exhibit hinge collapses in the anticline illustrated on the left side of the image, while the beds below this limestone layer are folded by many minor folds on the right side of the image. The anticlines and synclines illustrated in this VOM are second-order folds that have contributed to thicken the southwest limb of the larger-scale Vega de Los Viejos syncline. The syncline shown in the central part of the outcrop has been described in Poblet et al. (2022).\n\n\n4.1.3\nSan Emiliano\nThis outcrop is located on the steep slope of a road near the San Emiliano village, in the southwest portion of the Cantabrian Zone and in the southern branch of the Ibero-Armorican Arc, where E-W trending structures dominate (Fig. 1). The outcrop is located in the north limb of the kilometre-scale Huergas-Valgrande anticline (Marcos, 1968), also known as Villasecino anticline (De Sitter and Van den Bosch, 1969) (Fig. 4a). This anticline is a tight and approximately upright fold that strikes E\u2013W. A subvertical, E-W trending fault runs along the core of the anticline. This regional-scale anticline, interpreted as a Variscan fold that involves a Cambrian to Carboniferous stratigraphic succession, has been displayed in several geological maps and cross sections (De Sitter, 1962; Marcos, 1968; Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez et al., 1968; Alonso et al., 1989; Su\u00e1rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1991; Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2014) (Fig. 4a).\nA VOM was created using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 4b), and a cross section was obtained from the projection of the VOM geological interpretation onto a selected plane (Fig. 4c). The description of the outcrop below comes from the visualization and geological interpretation of the VOM and the cross section.\nThe rocks shown in the virtual outcrop belong to the Carboniferous Alba (or Genicera) Fm., colloquially known as \u201cCarboniferous griotte limestone\u201d, according to the available geological maps (Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 1991) (Fig. 4b and c). In outline, this outcrop consists of a homoclinal set of layers that dip steeply to the NNW. Taking into account the behaviour of the layers regarding deformation, they may be divided into three mechanical units. The lower mechanical unit, located to the south-southeast, is mainly made up of red limestones (\u201cgriotte\u201d facies) affected by large folds and faults, and the faults dip steeply. The intermediate mechanical unit, located in the central part of the outcrop, is formed by alternations of radiolarites and slates, and both folds and faults are more abundant than in the lower unit, they are smaller, and the faults display a wide range of dips. In the upper mechanical unit, located to the north-northwest and constituted by grey limestones with some reddish shale interbeds, the faults are scarce. According to Masini et al. (2010a) this outcrop was tilted in a counter clockwise sense around an ENE-WSW subhorizontal axis. The structures make sense from the geological point of view when removing this rotation until the layers reach a sub-horizontal position. Thus, the lower mechanical unit corresponds to a thrust ramp anticline located in the hangingwall of a series of thrusts that dip to the N in the rotated image. This lower unit is detached from the underlying units (south-southeast main fault in Fig. 4c). A detachment located at the top of the lower unit separates this unit from the intermediate unit (central main fault in Fig. 4c). The intermediate mechanical unit displays several detachment folds with abundant minor thrusts. Another detachment separates the intermediate from the upper unit. The upper mechanical unit is almost undeformed. These structures are responsible for thickening the north limb of the larger-scale Huergas-Valgrande\/Villasecino anticline. This virtual outcrop is presented here for the very first time, however, the reader can consult Masini et al. (2010b) and Bulnes et al. (2019) for further information on this outcrop.\n\n\n4.1.4\nLa Ballota\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located in La Ballota Beach, in the northeastern part of the Cantabrian Zone and in the north branch of the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc, where E\u2013W trending structures are the most common ones (Fig. 1). La Ballota outcrop is only accessible during periods of low tide. The outcrop is located in the north limb of a hundred-metres long anticline located to the north of the Cue anticline (Fig. 5a). This anticline is a tight, E-W striking fold, whose axial surface dips steeply to the N. This anticline is interpreted as a ramp fold located in the hangingwall of an E\u2013W, S-directed thrust that dips steeply to the N. This anticline is supposed to be a Variscan structure that involves an Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous succession according to the geological maps and sections constructed by Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez (1965), Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda (1980), Marqu\u00ednez (1989), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014), De Ana (2015) and Bulnes et al. (2016) (Fig. 5a).\nA VOM was constructed using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 5b), and a cross section was obtained from the projection of the geological interpretation onto a selected plane (Fig. 5c). The main features of the outcrop are described below based on the geological interpretation of the VOM and on the cross section.\nAccording to Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (1981) this outcrop is composed of limestones with slates that belong to the Carboniferous Alba Fm., also known as Genicera Fm. (Fig. 5b and c). This outcrop includes a very tight anticline in the north-northwest part and a closed syncline that occupies the central and south-southeast part of the outcrop. The hinge of the anticline shows extraordinary thickening at some incompetent stratigraphic levels. Both folds are a few metres wide and tall, and their axial surfaces are subvertical. The layers are cut and offset by abundant metre-scale, SSE directed thrusts whose dip varies from horizontal to subvertical since they are folded by the anticline and the syncline. In most of the trajectory of these thrusts, hangingwall flats over footwall flats occur, although some hangingwall and footwall ramps occur as well, specially near the anticline hinge and towards the south-southeast portion of the outcrop. Thus, this outcrop is basically a stack of folded thrust sheets. The axial surface of the folds, and in particular that of the syncline, do not exhibit a rectilinear path in cross-sectional view from the upper layers to the lower ones, but display \u201cjumps\u201d from one thrust sheet to the underlying one. The reason is that bedding surfaces were not parallel before folding because they had been cut and offset by thrusts. All these structures contributed to thicken the north limb of the larger-scale anticline located to the north of the Cue anticline.\n\n\n4.1.5\nAndr\u00edn\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located in the Andr\u00edn Beach, in the northeastern part of the Cantabrian Zone and in the north branch of the Ibero-Armorican or Asturian Arc, where the structures trend E\u2013W (Fig. 1). The outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. The outcrop belongs to the north limb (backlimb) of the kilometre-scale Cue anticline (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 1981), a closed, E\u2013W striking fold, whose axial surface dips steeply to the N (Fig. 5a). The Cue anticline is interpreted as a ramp fold located in the hangingwall of an E\u2013W thrust that dips steeply to the N and whose hangingwall exhibits a southwards sense of motion. The Cue anticline, developed during the Variscan orogeny, involves an Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous succession as shown in the available geological maps and sections (Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1lvarez, 1965; Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1980; Marqu\u00ednez, 1989; Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2014; De Ana, 2015; Bulnes et al., 2016) (Fig. 5a).\nA VOM was constructed using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 6a) and its geological interpretation was projected onto a selected plane to construct an undistorted geological cross-section (Fig. 6b). An outcrop description derived from the VOM interpretation and from the geological cross-section is presented below.\nThe studied virtual outcrop consists of red limestones that belong to the Carboniferous Alba (or Genicera) Fm. according to the available geological maps (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 1981) (Fig. 6a and b). In the southeastern part of the outcrop, several metre-scale, tight anticlines and synclines, whose hinges exhibit thickening with respect to the limbs and whose limbs dip to the same direction, appear. The axial surfaces of these folds are curve; thus, they dip moderately upsection but progressively become gently dipping to the SE until they are subhorizontal downsection because they have subsequently been refolded by another set of folds, giving rise to type 3 fold interference patterns (Ramsay, 1967). All these structures are located in the hangingwall of a decametre-scale, NW-directed reverse fault that dips steeply to the S and appears in the central part of the outcrop. In the footwall of this fault, i.e., in the northwestern part of the outcrop, a large syncline and a smaller anticline with thickened hinges, NW-dipping limbs and SW-dipping axial surfaces crop out. This virtual outcrop was presented in Mart\u00edn et al. (2019), however, its structural features are described here for the very first time.\n\n\n\n4.2\nAsturian Basin\nThe Asturian Basin is an inverted extensional basin that crops out along the North Iberian Margin and extends northwards under the Cantabrian Sea (Fig. 1). This basin is filled in with a Permian-Triassic siliciclastic succession including some volcanoclastic, carbonate and evaporitic deposits, a Lower-Middle Jurassic succession composed of marls and limestones, an Upper Jurassic succession formed by marls, shales and sandstones with some limestones, and Cretaceous alternations of siliciclastic and carbonate rocks (Garc\u00eda-Ramos and Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol, 1995). The two most important angular unconformities within the basin are located in between the Permian-Triassic succession and the Variscan basement of the Cantabrian Zone, and between the Lower Jurassic marine successions and the continental\/transitional Upper Jurassic rocks (Valenzuela et al., 1986). The internal structure of the basin mainly consists of Mesozoic normal faults of different orientations, some of them reactivated as reverse, oblique or strike-slip faults during a Cenozoic contractional episode, responsible for different modes of inversion tectonics from pure fault reactivation to buttressing structures (e.g., Lepvrier and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda, 1990; Uzkeda et al., 2016).\n\n4.2.1\nCervig\u00f3n\nThis outcrop is a small part of a coastal cliff located in the Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach, near the Cervig\u00f3n viewpoint, in the north-northwest part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). Stones may fall from the top of the high cliff where the outcrop is located and the outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. According to the available geological maps, the outcrop is located in the southwest limb of a kilometre-scale, very open syncline whose trend is NW-SE and involves a Jurassic succession (Fig. 7a and b). The portion of the basin where this outcrop is located was mapped in Beroiz et al. (1972b), Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974), Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol et al. (2002), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) and Odriozola (2016).\nThe VOM constructed using images taken with a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 7c) was the basis for a 3D geological model. A geological cross-section was obtained from the intersection of 3D geological surfaces with a selected plane (Fig. 7d). An outcrop description, derived from the geological interpretation of the VOM, and from the 3D model and geological cross-section, is presented below.\nThe studied virtual outcrop consists of marls and limestones that belong to the Rodiles Fm. of lower Early Jurassic age in this region (Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974) (Fig. 7c and d). The most striking structures in this outcrop are a metre-scale monoclinal anticline and a monoclinal syncline; these open folds are asymmetric and their axial surfaces dip moderately to the E. Two metre-scale, W-directed reverse faults with small displacement are developed in the hinge zone of the folds. The asymmetry of the folds, the sense of motion of the reverse faults and the cross-cutting relationships with other structures, which will be discussed below, suggest that these folds and faults have a genetic relationship. The tip of the lower reverse fault ends up against the syncline axial surface, while the other reverse fault involves upper stratigraphic horizons, runs through the common limb between the two folds and ends upsection as a hangingwall flat over a footwall flat. This suggests that the structure could be a fault-propagation fold related to the lower fault, while the other reverse fault would correspond to a breakthrough fault. An E-directed detachment, folded and offset by a reverse fault, occurs in the middle part of the stratigraphic succession. This detachment, in turn, cuts and offsets a metre-scale, E-directed normal fault with small displacement located in between the anticline and syncline hinges. The outcrop also includes a series of subvertical strike-slip faults; although these faults cut and offset the detachment, their temporal relationship with the folds, and the reverse and normal faults, are difficult to define since they develop in regions where the layers are flat-lying. Thus, apart from the strike-slip faults, the chronology of the structures would start with a normal fault, followed by a detachment, and finally the folds and reverse faults. The geometry of these structures suggests that the whole structure resulted from positive inversion tectonics so that the anticline hinge would nucleate in the normal fault hangingwall while the syncline in the footwall. The reader is referred to Uzkeda et al. (2018) for more information regarding this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n4.2.2\nBuerres\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located near the Huerres village, also called Buerres, in the north-northeast portion of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). The cliff where the outcrop is located is high, so that stones can fall, and the outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. The studied outcrop is located in the downthrown block of the Lastres fault, very close to the fault surface (Fig. 8a). This kilometre-scale, normal fault exhibits a NW-SE strike, dips steeply to the SW and involves Jurassic rocks (Uzkeda, 2013). The region around the studied outcrop was mapped by Beroiz et al. (1972a), Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014) and Uzkeda et al. (2016) (Fig. 8a).\nA VOM was obtained using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 8b). Its geological interpretation was used to construct a 3D geological model and the intersection of 3D geological surfaces with a plane allowed us to construct a geological cross-section (Fig. 8c). Below is a description of the outcrop derived from the visualization and geological interpretation of the VOM and from the geological cross-section.\nThe virtual outcrop analysed here involves marls and limestones that belong to the Rodiles Fm., whose age in this region ranges from Early to Middle Jurassic (Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974) (Fig. 8b and c). One of the most important structures in this outcrop is a metre-scale, SSE-directed fault, that currently exhibits normal motion, dips steeply to the SSE, and is located in the north-northwest edge of the outcrop. In the fault hanginwall, the layers are affected by a metre-scale, smooth anticline-syncline pair. The axial surfaces of these folds are subvertical, but the folds are slightly asymmetric since the south-southeast limb of the anticline is somewhat shorter and its dip is steeper than that of the north-northwest limb. The folded layers are cut and offset by a set of metre-scale, reverse faults with small displacements and gently dips to both the SSE and the NNW. They are thrusts and backthrusts. The cross-cutting relationships between the SSE-dipping and the NNW-dipping thrusts are complex, as some SSE-dipping thrusts cut and offset some NNW-dipping thrusts, but the opposite situation also occurs. This indicates that thrusts and backthrusts are approximately synchronous. Both the anticline-syncline pair and the thrusts and backthrusts are probably simultaneous structures. Since all these structures are only developed in the hangingwall of the normal fault very close to it, they are interpreted as buttressing structures. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that the hangingwall succession includes more marls and shales than that in the fault footwall, i.e., the hangingwall rocks are less competent than the footwall ones. Thus, the initially normal fault was responsible for a buttressing effect and was reactivated as a reverse fault giving rise to a positive tectonic inversion structure. The reader is addressed to Uzkeda et al. (2018) for further information on this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n4.2.3\nPe\u00f1arrubia\nThis outcrop covers part of the coastal cliff, part of the beach and part of the platform located in the Pe\u00f1arrubia Beach, in the north-northwest part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). Stones may fall from the upper parts of the high cliff and the platform can only be accessed during low tide periods. The outcrop comprises the hinge zone and both limbs of a kilometre-scale, NW-SE trending syncline. This smooth fold involves a Jurassic succession (Fig. 7a). Several geological maps illustrate the portion of the basin where this outcrop is located (Beroiz et al., 1972b; Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974; Guti\u00e9rrez-Claverol et al., 2002; Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2014; Odriozola, 2016).\nA VOM created using a photographic camera mounted on an UAV (Fig. 9a) was used to construct a 3D geological model. A geological map was obtained from the interpretation of the 3D geological model overlapped onto an orthophotograph of the outcrop (Fig. 9b). The geological description presented below is derived from the VOM geological interpretation, as well as from the 3D geological model and the geological map.\nThis virtual outcrop is made up of alternations of marls and limestones that belong to the Rodiles Fm., which in this region has a lower Early Jurassic age, as well as of conglomerates, sandstones and shales of La \u00d1ora Fm., whose age is Upper Jurassic according to Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974) (Fig. 9a and b). From a stratigraphic point of view, the map clearly shows an angular unconformity in between La \u00d1ora Fm. and the Rodiles Fm., so that in the southwestern part of the outcrop La \u00d1ora Fm. lays on older Rodiles Fm. beds (stratigraphic log C1 in Fig. 9b) than in the northeast part of the outcrop (stratigraphic log C2 in Fig. 9b). Regarding the structure, several NE-SW trending anticlines and synclines of hectometre lengths are recognized. Various faults have been also mapped. Most of these faults strike from ENE-WSW to NE-SW, reach a few hundred meters length, and cut and offset the traces of the aforementioned folds pointing out that they are younger.\n\n\n4.2.4\nLa Conejera\nThis outcrop is a coastal cliff located in La Conejera Inlet, in the north-northeast part of the emerged portion of the Asturian Basin (Fig. 1). Stones may fall from the high cliff where the outcrop is located and part of the outcrop can only be visited during low tide periods. According to Uzkeda et al. (2013), this outcrop is supposed to show part of the kilometre-scale Villaviciosa fault (Fig. 10a). This fault is a NE-SW striking structure with vertical or steep dip to the SE that involves Mesozoic rocks in both fault blocks. The outcrop and surrounding regions were mapped by Pignatelli et al. (1972), Su\u00e1rez-Vega (1974), Merino-Tom\u00e9 et al. (2014), Uzkeda et al. (2016) and Granado et al. (2018) (Fig. 10a).\nStereoscopical pairs of photographs of the outcrop were obtained using a photographic camera mounted on a tripod (Fig. 10b), and a geological cross-section was obtained from the projection of the geological interpretation onto two selected planes (Fig. 10c). We describe the outcrop below according to our geological interpretation of the stereoscopical pairs and to the geological cross-section.\nThe marls and limestones that make up the studied virtual outcrop belong to the Rodiles Fm., with an age of Early Jurassic in this area (Su\u00e1rez-Vega, 1974) (Fig. 10b and c). Two are the most important structures in this outcrop and both are located in the centre-northwest part of the outcrop. The first structure is a decametre-scale, normal fault that dips steeply to the SE and causes a notable layer displacement. The second one is a decametre-scale, open monoclinal anticline, whose southeast limb is subhorizontal whereas its northwest limb dips moderately to the NW against the fault mentioned above. The geometry of this monocline and its development in the hangingwall of the mentioned fault suggest that it could be interpreted as a rollover anticline related to the normal fault motion. On a metre-scale, there are abundant normal and reverse faults as well as folds. Reverse faults and folds postdate normal faults, are only developed in the hangingwall of the main fault and their density increases from the southeast towards the mentioned fault, while the interlimb angle of the folds decreases from the southeast towards the mentioned fault. The variation in the characteristics of these smaller-scale structures and their structural position suggest that they resulted from a buttressing phenomenon against the main normal fault causing its reactivation as a reverse fault. The fact that the rocks located in the footwall of the normal fault exhibit higher limestone and lesser marl contents than those located in the hangingwall is in agreement with this hypothesis. Thus, the overall structure of this outcrop resulted from positive inversion tectonics. We refer the reader to Uzkeda et al. (2013) for further information about the features of this virtual outcrop.\n\n\n\n\n5\nFinal considerations\nThere is no doubt that the application of digital techniques to the study of natural geological structures is a significant advance in Structural Geology, facilitating the process of collecting and processing field data and, in some situations, supplying additional information that would have been hard to obtain using traditional techniques solely. Once the images of the structures, their geological interpretation, as well as additional data, are \u201cinside\u201d our computer, a world of possibilities opens up to extract the information as geological maps and sections in any direction of space, as well as 3D geological models, which makes understanding them much faster and easier.\nGiven their benefits, we encourage all the structural geologists to use digital techniques and create more VOMs all over the world. In this sense, this work might help all those structural geologists who would like to use digital techniques to construct 3D geological models, geological cross-sections and maps, and obtain additional structural data, from outcrops of natural structures.\nAll the north-northwest Iberia outcrops studied here involve steep slopes (valley slopes, road slopes, coastal cliffs). On the one hand, the analysis of the VOMs has allowed obtaining dips, strikes and dip directions of layers, unconformities, faults, joints, fold limbs, fold axial surfaces, fold axes and intersection lines between beds and unconformities, located in the inaccessible parts of the outcrops. On the other hand, outcrops such as Cacabillo, La Ballota, Andr\u00edn, Cervig\u00f3n and La Conejera exhibit abundant inlets and outlets that make it difficult to correctly visualize and graphically represent the structures. However, the construction of VOMs has made it possible to visualize the 3D structural complexity and project the interpretations onto undistorted 2D geological sections, which has greatly facilitated their understanding. In the case of large outcrops such as Cacabillo, Pe\u00f1arrubia and La Conejera, the geological interpretation of the VOMs has permitted establishing local stratigraphic columns at outcrop scale, which has allowed the layers to be correlated from one edge to the other edge of the outcrop, and hence better understand the structures that affect them.\nThe most obvious use of the VOMs of the north-northwest Iberian Peninsula presented here is related to research and involves deciphering their main structural features. However, they also represent a contribution as a virtual fieldtrip across this part of the world, and are interesting from the teaching point of view as well, especially if they are incorporated into platforms specifically designed for these purposes, such as 3DGaia (https:\/\/www.imagedreality.com\/3d-gaia-vr-app). Regarding virtual fieldtrips and teaching, these VOMs could help Earth Science professionals and students to figure out the structural styles of the Cantabrian Zone and the Asturian Basin, as well as to learn about contractional and inversion tectonics structures. Thus, they can remotely visualize the VOMs from different perspectives, interpret them and understand these outcrops located in regions of difficult access (steep slopes, cliffs by the sea, intertidal regions) at any time, but specially during times when carrying out fieldwork is not possible because of travel restrictions caused by pandemics or similar situations. In addition, these VOMs allow costs to be reduced because the virtual fieldtrips can be repeated as many times as desired and involve less travel, which in turn reduces the carbon footprint, while increasing the visibility of the geology of this part of the world as well as equality, since the outcrops are accessible to people with disabilities.\nThe digital techniques have led to a sort of \u201crevolution\u201d within the Structural Geology, that advances day by day, and to which we should be aware, however, we believe we must continue combining both traditional and digital techniques because we found all of them useful and complimentary.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nHodei Uzkeda: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.

The characteristics of this claystone provide good retentive properties, and its low porosity and permeability can prevent the leakage of radionuclides (Krauskopf, 1988; \u00c1rkai et al., 2000). In this lithology, significant fluid pathways can exclusively form along planes of structural inhomogeneities and fractures (Anders et al., 2014). Therefore, the investigation of the fracture network geometry and its hydrodynamic behaviour is crucial in understanding the hydrodynamic behaviour of otherwise impermeable rock bodies. Vital areas of study include the connectivity of the fracture system, whether or not single fractures form communicating networks, and the size and location of all potential fracture clusters.\nThe size of hydrologically active fractures is usually within the resolution of seismic data but transcends the resolution of well log and microstructural studies (Paillet et al., 1993; Childs et al., 1997). Therefore, little information is available about the behaviour of fracture systems at the reservoir scale. Since fracture networks can be approximated as scale-invariant geometrical objects, structural data measured at microscales can be upscaled to larger dimensions (Turcotte, 1992; National Research Council, 1996). Such a discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling approach requires quantitative geometric data of the fracture network, such as the fracture size distribution, spatial density of fracture midpoints, and orientation (dip and dip direction). The essential features of the fractured rock body, such as the connectivity tendency of single fractures as well as the hydrodynamic behaviour of the system (fractured porosity and permeability), can be investigated using simulated models (M. T\u00f3th and Vass, 2011).\nThis paper aims to characterise the fracture network geometry and the hydrodynamic behaviour of the surroundings of the deepest well (BAF\u20132) in the BCF using fracture network modelling and evaluating hydraulic measurements in the well.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe late Permian BCF is located in SW Hungary (Fig. 1\n) and is a member of the 4000\u20135000\u00a0m thick Palaeozoic\u2013Triassic sedimentary sequence of the Western Mecsek Mountains. The formation consists of well-compacted reddish-brown claystone, siltstone, and albitolite (authigenic albite >50%) with dolomite and sandstone intercalations. The main rock-forming minerals are quartz, albite, illite-muscovite, chlorite, calcite, dolomite, and haematite (\u00c1rkai et al., 2000; M\u00e1th\u00e9, 2015). The maximal thickness of the formation is more than 1000\u00a0m and the distribution area is approximately 150\u00a0km2 (Konr\u00e1d and H\u00e1mos, 2006). The BCF was deposited in an alkaline lake environment on a periodically drying playa mudflat in an arid to semiarid climate (\u00c1rkai et al., 2000; Varga et al., 2005, 2006; Varga, 2009; Konr\u00e1d et al., 2010).\nThe study area is located around the subvertical profile of the BAF\u20132 well, which penetrated the formation in largest thickness of more than 900\u00a0m, with close to 100% core recovery. The well intersected characteristic reddish-brown, intensely tectonised claystone. The average dip direction of the bedding in the well is SE-SSE, and the dip is 40\u00b0 based on acoustic borehole televiewer (BHTV) observations (Bern\u00e1th et al., 2014; Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015).\nThe grain size gradually increases with depth (claystone - siltstone - fine sandstone). Above the Permian sequences, the BAF\u20132 well penetrated Quaternary (Holocene, Pleistocene) sediments between 0 and 9.10\u00a0m (reported depths are in the total measured depth in metres throughout the paper; Fig. 2\nA). Between 9.10 and 130\u00a0m, reddish-brown claystone with interbedded siltstone is the dominant rock type. This section is intensively weathered; presumably, the rock body was uncovered for an extended period of time in a warm and humid climate before and during the Miocene (Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015). Limonite, smectite and chlorite-smectite are present as significant alteration products in the uppermost 100\u00a0m of the well (Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015; M\u00e1th\u00e9, 2015; N\u00e9meth et al., 2016). The section between 130 and 757\u00a0m consists of reddish-brown claystone with siltstone beddings. Between 148.59\u2013153.90 and 233.36\u2013238.40\u00a0m, the well crosscuts two thick reductive layers; in these intervals, the sequence contains greenish-grey claystone (Fig. 2A). Presumably, these layers represent two independent reductive events. Based on the interpretation of the BHTV data, the tectonic repetition of the same horizon cannot be ruled out either (Bern\u00e1th, 2015; Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015). The first fine sandstone layer of significant thickness appears at 757.96\u00a0m. Below this horizon, the transition zone of the BCF to its coarser-grained bedrock is identified. In this interval, claystone with numerous siltstone and fine sandstone intercalations is the dominant rock type (Fig. 2A; Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015).\nNumerous subsequent tectonic phases could characterise the evolution of the area. Significant NE\u2013SW shortening during the Late Cretaceous (Benkovics et al., 1997) was followed by events related to the formation of the Pannonian Basin in the Neogene. Deformation due to tensional stresses in the early Miocene (Bergerat and Csontos, 1988; Csontos and Bergerat, 1992; Fodor et al., 1999) was followed by late Miocene (Sarmatian) compression (Sebe, 2017) and by thermal subsidence of the basin afterwards (Pannonian; Csontos et al., 2002; Maros et al., 2004). The most recent essential event is the ongoing tectonic inversion of the basin (Konr\u00e1d and Sebe, 2010).\n\nKonr\u00e1d et al. (2015) suggest a structural boundary at approximately 400\u00a0m in the BAF\u20132 well. Below this depth, the graded bedding style changes from normal to inverse, and thinning of the graded sequences is observed. In this segment, the sequence contains numerous smaller strata interpreted as overturned.\nMany geophysical well logs show a characteristic difference between the upper (0\u2013400\u00a0m) and lower (400\u2013915\u00a0m) parts of the well. The most significant deviation is shown in the sonic log (Fig. 2B), where the acoustic wave velocity drastically decreases below 400\u00a0m (Bern\u00e1th et al., 2014). This log indicates the mechanical properties of the rock body by measuring how fast the acoustic waves can travel through the rock body. Based on all this information, the current structural interpretation of Konr\u00e1d et al. (2015) suggests that the BAF\u20132 well intersected a tilted fold sheared by fault zones.\nPrevious studies distinguished four vein generations along the BAF\u20132 well that indicate multiple tectonic and\/or diagenetic processes (Hrabovszki et al., 2017, 2020, 2022; T\u00f3th et al., 2020). The veins are classified into the following categories: branched veins, straight veins, en echelon vein arrays, and breccia-like veins. In the BAF\u20132 well, the average dip values of the vein types are 42\u00b0 (branched veins), 70\u00b0 (straight veins), and 22\u00b0 (en echelon vein arrays) (Hrabovszki et al., 2017). All four vein generations occur all along the rock body. The fractures are filled predominantly with calcite, anhydrite, and barite-celestine (\u00c1rkai et al., 2000; Hrabovszki et al., 2020, 2022; T\u00f3th et al., 2020).\nAccurate knowledge of hydrogeological conditions is an essential requirement for assessing the suitability of a geological formation for the storage of radioactive waste. The general hydrogeological conditions of the Western Mecsek Mountains are determined by the morphology of the mountains and their surroundings. The Palaeozoic\u2013Mesozoic formations of the mountains rise 400\u2013500\u00a0m from their surroundings, defining a regional recharge zone whose discharge areas are the Neogene basins located in its wider periphery (Csics\u00e1k, 1999).\nDue to its petrophysical properties and thickness, the BCF is an aquiclude. Due to its high clay content, fracture self-sealing is also a frequent phenomenon (Csics\u00e1k, 1999). In its surface outcrops, the rock body is relatively well fragmented and significantly weathered; therefore, groundwater amounts can be significant in the uppermost 40\u201350\u00a0m. Based on hydraulic testing of the well, transmissivity decreases with depth; however, high-transmissivity zones also occur, even in the deeper parts (down to approximately 500\u00a0m). The well can be divided into two parts based on the transmissivity log. High-transmissivity zones occur mainly in the upper 500\u00a0m, while below 500\u00a0m, the transmissivity is close to constant at a significantly reduced value throughout the well. The highest value is 1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0m2\/s, while the lowest value is 2.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\u00a0m2\/s (Fig. 3\n; Andr\u00e1ssy et al., 2018).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nFracture networks usually follow a fractal-like pattern independent of the lithology and structural evolution (Barton and Larsen, 1985; La Pointe, 1988). Such an appearance allows fracture networks to be modelled at any scale using measured geometric data. In this study, a discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling approach was used to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of the rock body based on the geometric data of the individual fractures (Witherspoon et al., 1980; Neuzil and Tracy, 1981; Zimmerman and Bodvarsson, 1996).\nDFN modelling has two consecutive steps. First, the geometric parameters of the individual fractures must be determined. These parameters serve as the foundation for the simulation. The most important geometric parameters and those used in the modelling are the fracture length distribution, the spatial density of fracture midpoints, the orientations of the fractures, and their aperture. Second, the network is generated using a fracture modelling software program. In this study, the discrete fracture network modelling system called Infress (previously RepSim) was applied (M. T\u00f3th et al., 2004; M. T\u00f3th, 2010; M. T\u00f3th, 2018).\n\n3.1\nDetermination of the geometric parameters of fractures\nFracture size is one of the essential geometric parameters of DFN modelling. Numerous studies have shown that the distribution of fracture lengths follows a power-law function so that\n\n(1)\n\n\nN\n\n(\nL\n)\n\n=\nF\n\u2217\n\nL\n\n\u2212\nE\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere N(L) is the number of fractures with a length of L and E and F are the parameters of the distribution function (Yielding et al., 1992; Min et al., 2004). This asymmetric distribution denotes that the number of small fractures is significantly larger than the number of large fractures.\nMeasurement of fracture length cannot be easily performed on cores because most individual fractures do not terminate within the core. To solve this problem, M. T\u00f3th (2010) introduced a novel algorithm. Here, two images with different sensitivities are required to determine the length exponent (E in Eq. (1)). The number of fractures identified by the less sensitive method is necessarily less than the number of fractures seen by the more sensitive method, with a constant difference (\u0394N(L)). Using this difference and the detection limits of the applied methods, the parameters of Eq. (1) can be calculated. For further details, see M. T\u00f3th (2010). In our study, the length exponent was determined by comparing BHTV data (lower resolution) and core images (higher resolution) with image analysis. The images of the cores were taken with a Nikon D90 camera with a lens of 100\u00a0mm focal length and an aperture setting of f\/8 under constant ambient light conditions. The vertical resolution of the BHTV is 4\u00a0mm, while the resolution of the core images is 1\u00a0mm.\nThe spatial density of the fracture network can be defined by the fractal dimension of the fracture pattern. In a borehole, the real fracture network is crosscut by a line (defined by the well itself), resulting in a point series. In this case, the spatial density of the fractures can be characterised by computing the fractal dimension of this series. As the borehole image logs (e.g., BHTV) define the exact spatial position of fractures, the intersection points between the fracture network and the borehole can be interpreted as the point process in question. The fractal dimension of this pattern was calculated using rescaled range (R\/S) analysis, which aims to estimate the Hurst exponent. The degree of self-similarity is defined by the Hurst exponent (H) parameter, which is directly related to the fractal dimension so that:\n\n(2)\n\n\nD\n=\n2\n\u2212\nH\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter H was determined for each 100\u00a0m interval with an overlap of 50\u00a0m (0\u2013100\u00a0m, 50\u2013150\u00a0m, 100\u2013200\u00a0m, etc.) along the well using Benoit 1.0 software following the approach introduced by M. T\u00f3th (2010). In addition to the fractal dimension, another commonly used parameter that may also characterise the fracture density is the P10 parameter (number of intersections per metre), which was also calculated and plotted with depth. The orientations of the fractures were described by the dip direction and dip angle obtained from the BHTV data.\n\n\n3.2\nFracture network modelling and aperture calibration\nThe fracture network of the investigated well was generated in 3D by Infress fracture network modelling software (M. T\u00f3th, 2010; M. T\u00f3th and Vass, 2011; Bauer and M. T\u00f3th, 2017). This DFN software package simulates single penny-shaped fractures in a stochastic manner with the given geometric parameters of the fracture network. Infress generates the desired number of equally probable realisations of the fracture network geometry. A subroutine of the software code enables the investigation of the size and spatial position of the communicating subsystems of the simulated fracture networks (M. T\u00f3th and Vass, 2011). Based on the fracture network geometry and an aperture value for all fractures, the fractured porosity and the intrinsic permeability tensor elements can be computed for any cubic volume element of the modelled rock body. The algorithms and the mathematical background of the software code are described in detail by M. T\u00f3th, (2018).\nDetermining and even defining the fracture aperture are somewhat problematic (Vermilye and Scholz, 1995; Keller, 1998; Liu, 2005; Bisdom et al., 2016). The physical aperture is usually defined as the average distance between the opposite walls of the fracture that can be measured using an image analysis approach at any scale. In hydrodynamic processes, the hydraulic aperture should be used instead, which is defined as a theoretical conduit that produces the same flow rate as the real fracture (Olsson and Barton, 2001; Cheng et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, the fracture aperture should not be defined as an independent geometric parameter. It usually follows a power-law distribution function, similar to the fracture length, and a tight linear correlation can be assumed between the two parameters based on numerous studies (Barton and Larsen, 1985; Pollard and Segall, 1987; Gudmundsson et al., 2001):\n\n(3)\n\n\na\n=\nA\n\u2217\nL\n\n\n\nwhere a is the aperture, the aperture coefficient A is characteristic of the rock body, and L is the length of the fracture, which is the diameter of a theoretical penny-shaped fracture in the model. In many different rock types, the ratio of the maximal aperture to the length varies within approximately 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u20138\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 for joints and 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122 for shear fractures (Opheim and Gudmundsson, 1989; Vermilye and Scholz, 1995). Using this simple correlation, the initial aperture for every fracture with the modelled length can be computed. Finally, the modelled fractured porosity and permeability values estimated for any cubic cell depend exclusively on the fracture network geometry and the aperture coefficient (A).\nThe initial aperture of a fracture can be modified by numerous water-rock interaction processes, which can have different effects on the initial aperture from part to part along the fracture plane (Vermilye and Scholz, 1995). In addition, the aperture is affected by the prevailing stress field, fracture orientation, depth and roughness of the fracture wall (Kumar et al., 1991; Liu, 2005). Therefore, the current hydraulic fracture aperture is the result of numerous independent processes that make it difficult to estimate. Choosing reliable aperture values, nevertheless, is essential in the evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity behaviour of a fractured rock body.\nGiven the simulated fracture network geometry and the measured transmissivity data, the hydraulic aperture can be estimated by comparing the observed and modelled permeabilities following the algorithm outlined in Fig. 4\n.\nInfress software, as mentioned above, allows the calculation of the porosity (\u03c6\n\nini\n) and the 3x3 intrinsic permeability tensor for any cubic cell based on the generated fracture network geometry using an aperture coefficient value. As hydraulic measurements of a well do not account for the anisotropy of permeabilities, hereafter, the mean of the diagonal elements of the permeability tensor (k\n\nini\n) is used during calibration.\nBased on the measured transmissivity data, the observed permeability (k\n\nobs\n; Fig. 4) can be calculated. The transmissivity for the horizontal flow of a rock layer with a specified thickness of d is:\n\n(4)\n\n\nT\n=\nK\n\u2217\nd\n\n\n\nwhere T is the transmissivity and K is the hydraulic conductivity. The d value in Eq. (4) is the packer interval used for the transmissivity measurement. From the hydraulic conductivity, permeability is defined as:\n\n(5)\n\n\nK\n=\n\n\nk\n\u03f1\ng\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03f1 and \u03b7 are the density and the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, respectively, g is the gravitational acceleration, and k is the permeability of the rock body (Grant, 2005). The density and dynamic viscosity of the water were taken as unity in the equation. In this way, the observed permeability (k\n\nobs\n) can be determined for any interval where transmissivity was measured.\nIn our study, the hydraulic aperture (a\n\nhyd\n) of the fractures was obtained using the above aperture calibration approach (Fig. 4). The objective of aperture calibration is to change the aperture coefficient value (A) so that the two permeability values (k\n\nini\n and k\n\nobs\n) for the same volume become equal. To estimate permeability tensor elements with Infress, a rock volume of d\n3 was considered. In this way, an average aperture coefficient could be computed for each interval independently, allowing the effective porosity to be calculated for all sections.\nThe hydrodynamic characteristics of any rock body can be described using the flow zone indicator (FZI). This parameter is based on the covariation of porosity and permeability and is usually used to evaluate reservoir quality. This index can also be applied to define flow units, volumes of reservoirs in which the geological and petrophysical properties that control the fluid flow are internally consistent (Amaefule et al., 1993). According to Al-Dhafeeri and Nasr-El-Din (2007), FZI can be calculated as:\n\n(6)\n\nF\nZ\nI\n=\n\n\nR\nQ\nI\n\n\nN\nP\nI\n\n\n=\n\n\n0.0314\n\n\nk\n\u03a6\n\n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a6\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere FZI is the flow zone indicator in \u03bcm, NPI is the normalised porosity index, RQI is the reservoir quality index, k is the permeability in mD, and \u03a6 is the porosity in a volume fraction. FZI values are related to the porosity, permeability, capillary pressure, lithology distribution, mineralogy, and sedimentary structures and are also affected by diagenetic processes (Dezfoolian, 2013). Various combinations of these factors may result in distinct rock hydraulic flow units (HFUs). A HFU, by definition, is a volume of a rock body where the geological and petrophysical properties that control the fluid flow are internally consistent (Amaefule et al., 1993). It is worth noting that elevated FZI values do not necessarily mean better hydraulic conductivity; high values indicate only the changing relationship between porosity and permeability. For example, FZI can increase with increasing permeability due to fracturing; if the porosity does not grow to the same extent or if porosity drops without a significant decrease in permeability, FZI may also increase.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nFracture network parameters\nFracture density can be defined in many different ways. The number of fractures per metre index (P10) was calculated for every 100\u00a0m with 50\u00a0m overlap based on the BHTV data (Fig. 5\nA). This calculation includes all planes detected by BHTV, including faults, veins, joints and bedding planes. The upper part of the well, between 100 and 420\u00a0m, is highly fractured; the average fracture density is 9\u201310\u00a0m\u22121. Below 420\u00a0m, three fractured zones can be distinguished at \u223c500, \u223c650, and \u223c850\u00a0m (5\u20136\u00a0m\u22121). The fracture density between these zones is low; 3\u20134 fractures per metre can be found in the least fractured sections (Fig. 5A).\nThe fractal dimension (D) was calculated for 100\u00a0m long sections of the well with 50\u00a0m overlap. The average D is 1.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, while high D values characterise three well-defined zones, 140\u2013250, 580\u2013680 and 790\u2013870\u00a0m, with elevated fracture densities (Fig. 5B). A single length exponent (E) and an F parameter were calculated for the entire well using the approach detailed by M. T\u00f3th (2010): E\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.90 and F\u00a0=\u00a010.00.\nBased on the BHTV evaluations, most planes detected in the borehole have an SSE dip direction (Fig. 6\n) with an average orientation of \u223c N162\u00b0 E\u221260\u00b0. The planes in this group primarily indicate sedimentary bedding and probably fracture planes parallel to layering (Fig. 6).\n\n\n4.2\nFracture network modelling\nModelling was carried out in a 150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0925\u00a0m cuboid surrounding the well. The presence of connected subsystems can characterise the simulated fracture networks in each run. Based on the above-mentioned fracture network parameters and 20 independent runs, five typical geometries were distinguished regarding the communication of the fracture network (Fig. 7\n).\nIn the first case, the whole fracture system defines one communicating group (Fig. 7A). In many cases, two connected subsystems are present that do not interconnect with each other. The boundaries between the subgroups vary from one run to another and appear at \u223c300, \u223c400 or \u223c700\u00a0m (Fig. 7B, C, D). In some cases, the fracture system of the well splits into four connected fracture subgroups along the boundaries at \u223c100, \u223c400, and \u223c700\u00a0m (Fig. 7E).\n\n\n4.3\nEstimation of the aperture coefficient and effective fractured porosity\nThe values of the calibrated aperture coefficient (A in Eq. (3)) of the 20\u00a0m long intervals, from which the transmissivity data were obtained, decrease with depth and vary between 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 and 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 (Fig. 5C). The hydraulic aperture of a fracture with a diameter of 1\u00a0m may change between 4\u00a0\u03bcm and 0.8\u00a0mm, depending on the influence of the post-tectonic fluid-rock interaction processes, the degree of closure with depth and the current stress field. The aperture coefficient of the fracture system in the lower half of the well is significantly reduced in two sections (380\u2013420\u00a0m and 580\u2013850\u00a0m), while the upper section (120\u2013160, 200\u2013240 and 320\u2013340\u00a0m) is characterised by elevated values.\nThe effective porosity log (Fig. 5D) follows the anomalies seen on the aperture coefficient log (Fig. 5C). Sections with a high effective porosity are characteristic in the upper part of the well (above 400\u00a0m). There are two sections with significantly higher porosity values in the lower part at \u223c500\u00a0m and \u223c850\u00a0m, while a small increase can be detected at \u223c780\u00a0m (Fig. 5D).\n\n\n4.4\nPoro-perm diagram and the flow zone indicator\nThe examination of the porosity and permeability data together allows the characterisation of the reservoir bodies from a hydrodynamic point of view. Therefore, the conventional porosity-permeability (abbreviated as poro-perm hereafter) diagram was constructed, and FZI values were calculated for all 44 data points along the well. The permeability data were derived from hydraulic measurements of the well, while the porosity data were estimated based on the DFN model and the calibrated aperture coefficients. The largest section of the well follows the same trend on the poro-perm diagram with an excellent fit (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.986; Fig. 8\nA, black curve). In this section the typical value of the FZI is between 200 and 350 (Fig. 8C\/b, d, f). There are three narrow, distinct zones with elevated FZI values (60\u2013110\u00a0m, 350\u2013420\u00a0m, and 690\u2013770\u00a0m; Fig. 8C\/a, c, e). The data points for all of these sections lie on the same trend on the poro-perm diagram (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.977; Fig. 8A, orange curve). Using the poro-perm trends and the FZI values, the studied well can be subdivided into six hydraulic flow units (Fig. 8B and C).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nEvaluation of the structural elements of the well\nThis study examines the fracture network of a potential high-level radioactive waste repository site in Hungary using fracture network modelling. The modelling parameters were determined primarily using BHTV data and core images of the BAF\u20132 well. A BHTV records fracture planes and bedding similarly along the borehole; both appear as sinusoidal curves in the images. Although several steep fractures crosscut the studied formation, many others lie parallel to the bedding surfaces (Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015). This geometry suggests that due to competence contrast these planes were most effectively deformed during tectonic or atectonic events. Consequently, fractures and stratifications are difficult to distinguish using BHTV images in the lithologically homogeneous sections of the rock body. On the other hand, fractures and bedding planes may play an identical hydrodynamic role, as they all may act as migration pathways for water and radionuclides. Therefore, for modelling purposes, we took into account every discontinuity within the rock body detected by the BHTV. Therefore, the results of the fracture network modelling approach outline the worst-case scenario regarding the hydraulic features and fracture connectivity of the studied rock body, which is a potential host rock for the repository of high-level radioactive waste.\n\n\n5.2\nFracture density of the well\nTwo numerical indices were used to characterise the fracture intensity of the formation: the number of fractures within a metre (P10 index) and the fractal dimension. Based on both indicators, the well can be subdivided into two major sections with a boundary at approximately 400\u00a0m. The fracture density (P10 log) characteristics differ significantly between the lower and upper sections of the well; a well-defined, sharp boundary horizon can be drawn between them. Several factors can affect the fracture density of a rock body, among which the rock type, grain size, prevailing stress field and tectonic events are the most essential. In the BAF\u20132 well, the average grain size of the sediment continuously increases downwards without any abrupt jump at 400\u00a0m, and no significant change in lithology can be detected at this depth. Any discontinuous change along this boundary in either the thickness or the lithology of the beds could influence the fracture pattern. Furthermore, both the average grain size and the diagenetic history of the various rock types might result in different rheological properties, causing diverse rock bodies to respond differently to the same stress field (Brace and Riley, 1972; Paterson, 1978). Even a slight change in the petrophysical features of the rock could influence the fracture density (National Research Council, 1996). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the change in the fracture pattern at 400\u00a0m is caused by the increasing average grain size and thus the difference in the rheological parameters of the formation.\nOn the other hand, based on stratigraphic irregularities, such as overturned beds and changes in graded sequences, some authors have suggested the presence of a structural boundary in the well (Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015). This assumption is also supported by the acoustic wave velocity log, which shows an abrupt change in the rock body at 400\u00a0m (Bern\u00e1th et al., 2014).\nIn the lower part of the borehole, sandstone layers are more common towards the bedrock below 757\u00a0m, where the first sandstone layer with a significant width appears. Here, the density of fractures (P10 index) decreases simultaneously with the presence of sandstone layers (Fig. 5A), further strengthening the correlation between the fracture geometry and the grain size of the host rock.\nAlternatively, instead of changing of the rock type, the three highly fractured zones in the lower half of the well may indicate three distinct shear zones determined by the prevailing stress field. In this model, poorly deformed horizons separate the shear zones at 580 and 710\u00a0m.\n\n\n5.3\nHydrological evaluation of the fracture network\nThe aperture coefficient, which is the aperture of a fracture of unit size, significantly influences the hydrological behaviour of fractured rock bodies. Its value continuously decreases downwards with intervals of anomalous behaviour. The coincident scattering of the hydrological aperture may be the consequence of diverse water-rock interaction processes such as dissolution and cementation. The reduction in the aperture coefficient along the borehole coincides with more closed, presumably more cemented, fractures. In contrast, larger aperture coefficient values indicate open fractures, which could form as a result of weak cementation, dissolution or in situ stresses (Lowell et al., 1993; Laubach et al., 2004; Barton, 2014; Bisdom et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2018).\nThe two major sections (upper part: 0\u2013400\u00a0m; lower part: 400\u2013915\u00a0m) of the well determined by the fracture density are also traceable along with the aperture coefficient and effective porosity logs. The aperture coefficients of the fractures vary significantly in the upper section, where well-cemented and poorly cemented sections probably alternate (Tokan-Lawal et al., 2017). The effective porosity varies depending on the change in the aperture coefficient; where the fractures are more open, the effective porosity increases. In the lower section, the aperture of the fractures decreases significantly. Two of the fracture zones in the lower part at 500 and 850\u00a0m have slightly increased aperture coefficients and effective porosity values. The fractures in these zones are probably less cemented. Deeper segments of the borehole generally have smaller aperture coefficients and effective porosity values. The highly fractured zone at 650\u00a0m determined by the P10 parameter (Fig. 5A) cannot be detected on either the aperture coefficient log or the effective porosity log. Based on this observation, this fracture zone probably contains well-cemented fractures that are less hydraulically active. Furthermore, this zone exemplifies that a dense fracture network does not automatically coincide with a hydraulically active system.\nThe hydraulic behaviour of the well can also be characterised by FZI, which concludes the relationship between porosity and permeability. Two different trends can be recognised along the well based on the poro-perm diagram. A significant part of the rock body aligns to a single trend, suggesting that the predominantly homogenous lithology of the BAF\u20132 well also has homogeneous hydrodynamic features.\nThere are three 60\u2013100\u00a0m wide sections, where the data determine a different trend on the poro-perm plot and the coinciding FZI values also differ. All of these sections form independent hydraulic flow units along the well. Such deviations may be caused by changes in lithological or structural features.\n\n5.3.1\nWeathered HFU\nThe first hydraulic unit of the BAF\u20132 well with elevated FZI values appears between 60 and 110\u00a0m (Fig. 8C\/a). In this section, the porosity decreases more considerably than the permeability, causing an increase in FZI. A possible explanation for this behaviour is that this section of the rock body is significantly altered by weathering, which is the result of the long-term near-surface position of the BCF. Limonite is present in the upper 100\u00a0m of the well that formed due to weathering of the haematite-bearing host rock by meteoric waters in the upper part of the rock body (Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015). As the limonite density is approximately 2.7\u20134.3\u00a0g\/cm3 and that of haematite is 5.3\u00a0g\/cm3, hydration of the original rock-forming mineral phase is accompanied by a significant volume increase in the host rock. The volume increases from 30.28 to 41.64\u00a0cm3 for each mole of haematite, which should cause a considerable reduction in the matrix porosity. Besides limonite, smectite and chlorite-smectite formed during weathering in the uppermost 100\u00a0m (M\u00e1th\u00e9, 2015). This alteration of clay minerals further reinforces the same tendency of porosity reduction. Permeability, which is mainly connected to structural elements, such as fractures and bedding planes, is less reduced due to the same hydration processes. Hence, limonite formation and the alteration of clay minerals greatly influenced the hydraulic behaviour of the rock body, allowing the development of a flow unit with increased FZI values in the uppermost zone of the well.\n\n\n5.3.2\nSheared HFU\nThe second hydraulic flow unit, which differs from the primary FZI trend, occurs between 350 and 420\u00a0m (Fig. 8C\/c). Along this section, the porosity is very low (Fig. 5D), but the permeability does not decrease to the same extent, resulting in elevated FZI values (Fig. 8C\/c). At approximately 400\u00a0m, this depth interval appears as a boundary in several features along the well. Here, a significant drop in the fracture density is apparent (Fig. 5A), which alone should cause simultaneous decreases in porosity and permeability, but this would not change the FZI trend.\nNevertheless, the above calculations confirm that the aperture coefficient is substantially reduced in this depth interval. The anomalously low aperture coefficient values suggest that the fractures are more intensely closed than is typical in the well. Furthermore, a sharp decrease in the acoustic wave velocity is also observed below 400\u00a0m. This feature reflects the appearance of a rock body with significantly different rock mechanical properties, even if the lithology and the fracture geometry parameters (other than the density) do not change at this boundary. Furthermore, the presence of all four vein generations (Hrabovszki et al., 2017, 2020, 2022; T\u00f3th et al., 2020) along the well suggests that the entire rock column shares an identical structural evolutionary history.\n\nKonr\u00e1d et al. (2015) explained that the difference between the upper (0\u2013400\u00a0m) and lower (400\u2013915\u00a0m) segments of the rock body developed during uplift of the formation and the coincident loosening of the upper section. Nevertheless, exhumation would result in a continuous transition in the fracture density and would not justify the observed pattern. The well-defined boundary may instead indicate lithological or structural changes. Based on sedimentological observations (changes in the style of graded bedding, overturned strata sections, etc.), a large-scale shear zone was previously assumed to be present around the same interval (Konr\u00e1d et al., 2015), without the possibility of precisely locating it. Such a large-scale fault zone is difficult to detect using exclusively small-scale observations. Fault evolution in hard claystones starts with cataclasis, where clay gouges could fill the space between the initial fractures. As faulting progresses, a fully reworked clay gouge could form, which is often not accompanied by mineralogical changes. These evolutionary stages coexist in a fault zone (Holland et al., 2006). The separation of the lithotypes of a fault zone in the highly fractured BCF is difficult, but the changes in porosity and transport properties could strongly indicate a fault zone (Holland et al., 2006).\nThe FZI log also draws this broad interval as an independent hydraulic flow unit. Above this HFU (350\u2013420\u00a0m), the FZI values continuously deviate from the primary trend. Below this zone, FZI values continuously decrease forming a more than 100\u00a0m wide disturbed zone (Fig. 8C). Taking all observations into account, the entire flow unit with elevated FZI values can indicate the core and the damage zones of a large-scale fault zone. The low fracture density and low porosity in the core zone may be derived from the self-sealing properties of the claystone (Holland et al., 2006; Zhang, 2013; Rutqvist et al., 2020). The very low aperture coefficient values in the core zone also confirm this phenomenon. We propose a large-scale structural boundary at 400\u00a0m crosscut by the BAF\u20132 well. Considering all the above findings, a shear zone more than 100\u00a0m wide can be supposed at this interval in the rock body.\n\n\n5.3.3\nCoarse-grained HFU\nThe third section in the borehole with elevated FZI values appears between 690 and 770\u00a0m (Fig. 8C\/e). At the boundary of the zone, FZI values change abruptly; unlike to the anomalous zones mentioned above, there is no continuous transition between the major trend and this HFU.\nIn this zone, the fracture density is not too high, but both the aperture coefficient and the porosity values are slightly elevated. Since sandstone layers become more frequent at this interval, the changes in the hydraulic properties of this section may be due to lithological reasons.\nOn the other hand, in this HFU the sonic log disturbance is similar to the behaviour observed at approximately 400\u00a0m (Fig. 2B). The acoustic wave velocity decreases significantly, especially between 680 and 690\u00a0m. The similarity of this pattern to the structural boundary at 400\u00a0m implies that another structural boundary is located at this depth. In this case, the core of the fault zone may be indicated by the lowest velocity of the acoustic waves between 680 and 690\u00a0m, and the highly fractured section may represent the damage zone (Holland et al., 2006).\nAt both margins of this HFU FZI are lowest within the whole rock column (FZI >200). Between 640 and 670\u00a0m (Fig. 8C), fracture density increases; one of the three fracture zones of the lower part of the well appears in this depth interval. This section could form a flow unit if we draw the lower limit of the main trend at 200 FZI values, but the poro-perm trend of these data points is very similar to the main trend. Therefore, it is just a matter of interpretation whether it is an independent unit or not. The lithology does not change significantly here, and the mineral compositions of the four vein generations are unchanged (Hrabovszki et al., 2017, 2020, 2022; T\u00f3th et al., 2018, 2020). Therefore, this section could not have formed due to its unique lithology or a different history of vein formation. Nevertheless, this section contains well-cemented fractures, as indicated by the aperture coefficients and effective porosity logs mentioned above (Fig. 5C and D). The high fracture density in this section could enhance fluid flow, leading to a high degree of cementation (Lee et al., 1996). This process should result in decreasing permeability and low FZI values. As a result, this depth interval has the worst hydraulic properties of the entire well, despite being one of the highly fractured zones of the well.\nThis hydraulic unit could have formed due to the complex effects of several processes. Among them, the increasing number of coarse-grained beds and the impact of a possible structural boundary are the most emphasised.\n\n\n\n5.4\nNear-well fracture network geometry\nThe geometry of the fracture system corroborates the designated hydraulic units within the well. In some cases, the whole modelled fracture system defines one connected system. Therefore, the fracture geometry properties allow a more than 1000\u00a0m wide, hydraulically communicating fracture system (Fig. 7A).\nIn numerous fracture network models, connected fracture subgroups form and are usually separated at the well-defined depths mentioned above. These designated boundaries appear at approximately 100, 400 and 700\u00a0m. At these particular depths, the fracture system should be close to its percolation threshold; therefore, the fracture network connectivity cannot be predicted (Berkowitz, 1995; M. T\u00f3th and Vass, 2011). Even small changes in the modelling parameters can significantly influence the connectivity between the subsystems. Even using the same parameter set may result in different fracture patterns in terms of connectivity (M. T\u00f3th and Vass, 2011).\nTaking the modelled fracture geometries together with the information from the hydraulic flow units, the rock body of the BAF\u20132 well can be divided into four blocks (Fig. 7E) with boundaries at approximately 100, 400 and 700\u00a0m. Around these boundaries, the rock body has specific hydraulic and rheological properties; otherwise, it behaves homogeneously from both physical aspects. Furthermore, all the blocks are affected by the main vein-forming events that developed the four vein generations of the well.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this study, we examined the hydrological consequences of the fracture system of a claystone formation. A fundamental attribute of a fracture network is its spatial density, based on which the studied rock column can be divided into two major parts. The upper part of the BAF\u20132 well, between 0 and 400\u00a0m, is highly fractured, while the lower section, below 400\u00a0m, contains significantly fewer fractures on average. The lithology of the well is mostly homogenous; nevertheless, coarser-grained beds become more frequent with depth. The positions of the intensely fractured zones are primarily determined by tectonic processes, but the changing grain size could also influence the fracture density.\nThe hydraulic properties of the fracture system were investigated using measured permeabilities and computed effective porosities. For this calculation, aperture coefficients were estimated using DFN models for each depth interval where transmissivity measurements were available. The data evaluation suggests that two different poro-perm trends define the hydraulic behaviour of the rock body crosscut by the studied well. While most intervals conform to one trend, three sections differ from it and define distinct hydraulic flow units based on the FZI values.\nThe communicating fracture clusters and the hydraulic flow units designate the same horizons in the well. Considering the hydraulic characteristics and the fracture geometry, the rock body of the BAF\u20132 well could be divided into four blocks separated by boundaries at \u223c100, \u223c400 and \u223c700\u00a0m. The formation of the boundary at \u223c100\u00a0m is related to the alteration of the rock due to weathering. Another boundary at \u223c400\u00a0m probably represents the core zone of a wide shear zone. In comparison, the horizon at \u223c700\u00a0m could result from the combined effects of lithology and tectonic activity.\nThis study outlines the fracture network geometry and the hydraulic features of the BAF\u20132 well, which may provide a solid basis for further hydrodynamic modelling of the well and its surroundings.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nEmese T\u00f3th: Writing- Original draft preparation, Visualization, Investigation, Conceptualization, Ervin Hrabovszki: Writing - Review & Editing, F\u00e9lix Schubert: Conceptualization, Writing - Review & Editing Tivadar M.

These bed-parallel veins commonly contain fibrous to prismatic mineral fill with fibers perpendicular to fracture walls (termed \u201cbeef\u201d), and are typically composed of calcite, gypsum, or quartz (Cobbold et al., 2013). The vertical opening of these veins has generally been interpreted as evidence of fluid overpressure related to seepage forces (Cobbold and Rodriguez, 2007) or tectonic stress (Ukar et al., 2017; Hooker et al., 2019; Abaab et al., 2021; Ferrill et al., 2021). In the case of calcite beef veins, vertical opening and vein formation as a result of overpressure has been attributed to local hydrocarbon generation and associated increases in pore pressure (Stoneley, 1983; Cobbold et al., 2013).\nBed-parallel fibrous opening-mode veins have been observed associated with contractional folds in mudstone and evaporites, with curved fibers indicating a component of fold-related shear (Abaab et al., 2021). Where bed-parallel opening-mode veins occur in the hinges of tight folds as saddle reefs (Ramsay, 1974; Ramsay and Huber, 1987), these are generally interpreted as having formed at a relatively late stage of fold formation, during fold tightening, rather than during early folding and amplification. Bed-parallel opening-mode veins that are laterally continuous across contractional folds have also been recognized (Henderson et al., 1986, 1990), but in contrast to late-stage saddle reef structures, these have been interpreted as having formed in flat-lying strata prior to fold formation and amplification.\nBed-parallel fibrous quartz and calcite veins with fibers parallel to bedding are also common in folded sedimentary strata (Ramsay and Huber, 1987; Tanner, 1989; Jessell et al., 1994). These veins with bed-parallel fibers are commonly formed as stepped crystal-fiber slickensides, representing shear or hybrid failure, and often developed during flexural-slip folding (Ramsay and Huber, 1983, 1987; Tanner, 1989; Jessell et al., 1994; Rybak-Ostrowska et al., 2014). Similar bed-parallel fibrous veins and bed-parallel or bed-oblique fibers or elongate grains have been interpreted as having formed along subhorizontal detachments prior to folding and subsequently folded (Fitches et al., 1986; Jessell et al., 1994). These bedding-plane-slip related veins are kinematically distinct from the opening-mode bed-parallel veins with bed-perpendicular fibers investigated in this study.\nThis paper documents outcrop investigations of the Cretaceous Boquillas Formation (lateral equivalent of the Eagle Ford self-sourced oil and gas reservoir in south Texas) exposed along Highway 90 east of the town of Langtry, Texas (Fig. 1\n), where gypsum beef and calcite veins are associated with a broad, low-amplitude (\u2018gentle\u2019 in terminology of Ramsay, 1967) anticline. Structural geologic analyses of fold geometry and bed-parallel veins are used to assess the relationship between folding and bed-parallel vein development in organic-rich source rock strata that never reached hydrocarbon generation conditions. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analyses of veins, along with cross-cutting relationships, are used to constrain depth of burial and fluid history associated with vein system development. These results document thrust regime deformation near the Laramide contractional front, and have relevance to deformation and associated structures in low-permeability fine-grained sedimentary strata and self-sourced hydrocarbon reservoirs.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe Boquillas Formation is the lateral equivalent of the Eagle Ford Formation, a major self-sourced (unconventional) oil and gas reservoir in south Texas (Treadgold et al., 2010; Breyer, 2016; Breyer et al., 2016). Hydrocarbon production from the Eagle Ford Formation, like other unconventional reservoirs, is dependent on mechanical stratigraphy, natural deformation fabrics in the rock, and in-situ stress conditions (Ferrill et al., 2014a; Bodziak et al., 2014). Natural deformation features within the Eagle Ford Formation in the productive trend of south Texas (primarily between the Rio Grande and the San Marcos Arch) include extensional structures around the margin of the Gulf of Mexico Basin. Reservoir-scale extensional deformation in the Eagle Ford Formation and laterally equivalent Boquillas Formation is widely recognized and has been documented in several recent studies (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2017c, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; McGinnis et al., 2017; Gottardi and Mason, 2018). Contractional structures, such as the Chittim anticline, formed in the Eagle Ford and Boquillas Formations during the Laramide Orogeny (Rose, 1984; Scott, 2010; Ewing, 2016). Approximately the western one third (by area) of the potentially productive subsurface Eagle Ford play in south Texas lies west of the Laramide macrostructural front (Fig. 1) as defined by Ferrill et al. (2020a), where distributed small-scale contractional deformation is likely (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2016; 2017b; 2020b, 2021).\n\n2.1\nStratigraphy\nThe Boquillas Formation and laterally equivalent Eagle Ford Formation were deposited during the Late Cretaceous (ca. 98-90\u00a0Ma; Minisini et al., 2018) sea level highstand across the northwest Gulf of Mexico Basin and intersection with the western interior seaway (Hovorka and Nance, 1994; Goldhammer and Johnson, 2001; Lock and Peschier, 2006; Donovan and Staerker, 2010; Lock et al., 2010; Donovan et al., 2012, 2016; Phelps et al., 2013; Eldrett et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b; Denne and Breyer, 2016; Rose, 2016; Minisini et al., 2018; Lehrmann et al., 2019). In detail, the Boquillas Formation represents a complex assemblage of calcareous mudrock, chalk, limestone, and volcanic ash (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Hentz and Ruppel, 2010; Scott, 2010; Lock et al., 2010; Fr\u00e9bourg et al., 2016; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Cyclic alternation between chalk and mudrock in the Boquillas Formation and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation have been attributed to climate cycling (Eldrett et al., 2015b; Lehrmann et al., 2019). Bed-scale variations in composition and texture in the Boquillas and Eagle Ford Formations define mechanical layering that has been shown to strongly influence brittle deformation including extension fracturing (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017b; McGinnis et al., 2017), normal faulting (Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2017c), and small-scale thrust faulting (Ferrill et al., 2016) in these formations.\n\n\n2.2\nStructural and tectonic setting\nThe study area is within approximately 10\u00a0km of the NW-SE trending Laramide macrostructural front, which is interpreted from the distribution of contractional macrostructures in Cretaceous strata (Fig. 1; Ferrill et al., 2020a). Regionally, the Laramide macrostructural front steps eastward from the Marathon uplift to the west (Turner et al., 2011; Surpless et al., 2015; Surpless and Wigginton, 2020), following the northern edge of the Devils River uplift to the east (Webster, 1980; Calhoun and Webster, 1983; Nicholas, 1983), then bending southeast into south Texas to include the Zavala syncline, Chittim anticline, and Eagle syncline near the Rio Grande (Fowler, 1956; Rose, 1984). Laramide contraction (\u223c80\u201340\u00a0Ma) deformed Cretaceous strata across northeast Mexico, and south and west Texas (Goldhammer and Johnson, 2001; Lehman, 1991). Laramide structures include large-scale folds and thrust faults (e.g., Fowler, 1956; Webster, 1980; Maxwell, 1967; Moustafa, 1988; Erdlac, 1990; Turner et al., 2011), as well as distributed small-scale faults, folds, tectonic stylolites, joints, and veins (e.g., Moustafa, 1988; Erdlac, 1990; Ferrill et al., 2016, 2021; Surpless and Wigginton, 2020).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nLithostratigraphy and mechanical stratigraphic characterization\nA lithostratigraphic section was measured bed-by-bed at the centimeter scale through the exposure (Fig. 2\n). This and other measured lithostratigraphic sections in the region are presented and discussed as part of a regional sedimentology study by Lehrmann et al. (2019).\n\n\n3.2\nStructural characterization\nStructural characterization started with preparation of a full outcrop photomosaic of the exposure. This photomosaic served as the basis for field mapping of key stratigraphic horizons and faults through the outcrop and for locating other data including bedding and fracture measurements, vein samples for fluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analysis, and bed-perpendicular vein scanline surveys. No tectonic or compactional stylolites were observed in the exposure. During field work, we recognized that the thickness and distribution of bed-parallel veins appeared to vary through the exposure, and that bed-parallel veins appeared to be best developed (thickest and highest frequency) within the dominant anticline in the exposure. To explore this apparent relationship further, we conducted bed-perpendicular vein surveys at five locations across the anticline structure. Vein composition, total vein thickness by vein type (calcite or gypsum), combined vein thickness, total rock thickness, and total vein intensity (number of veins per length of bed-perpendicular vein survey) were recorded at each survey location. Two of these surveys were located in the synclinal hinges bounding the anticline, two were conducted in the limbs of the anticline, and one survey was conducted in the anticline crest. For consistency, each survey was conducted perpendicular to bedding through the same representative mudrock and chalk interval that was accessible across the structure (Fig. 3\n).\nGround-based laser scan data and digital photographs of the study site were collected and used to generate a georeferenced, photorealistic digital outcrop of the 50-m-wavelength gentle anticline and bounding synclines. This photogrammetric digital outcrop was used for mapping horizons across the structure, and for capturing bed-by-bed structural geometries across the anticline and bounding synclines. 3D polyline interpretations were used for cross section construction and analysis by projecting 3D digital outcrop interpretations onto a plane oriented normal to the fold axis in Move 2019.1\u2122 (Petroleum Experts).\n\n\n3.3\nFluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analysis\nFluid inclusion and stable isotope geochemistry analyses were performed on vein samples in order to constrain the fluid history of calcite.\n\n3.3.1\nMicrothermometry and fluid inclusion UV fluorescence\nFluid inclusion microthermometry (homogenization temperatures of two-phase inclusions and ice melting temperatures of aqueous inclusions) was used to constrain vein formation temperatures. Results can provide the basis for estimating depth of vein formation from two-phase inclusions, and estimating salinity of aqueous fluid inclusions (e.g., Parris et al., 2003; Hanks et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2010; Evans 2010; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017a, 2020a). Fluid inclusion fluorescence was used to identify liquid hydrocarbon inclusions, and to compare trapped fluids between samples to distinguish trapping events. This method has been used extensively to characterize liquid hydrocarbon inclusions (e.g., Bourdet and Eadington, 2012; Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014; Evans et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2020a; Volk and George, 2019). Hydrocarbon inclusion fluorescence color has been linked to the API gravity of the trapped fluids (e.g., Burruss et al., 1983, 1985; McLimans, 1987; Burruss, 1991; Lisk et al., 1996; Lisk and Eadington, 1994; Parnell et al., 1998), but fluorescence color can be affected by a variety of factors including biodegradation, water-washing, fluid mixing, and migration fractionation (George et al., 2001). Sample collection, preparation and fluid inclusion microthermometric procedures used in this study are the same as those summarized in Ferrill et al. (2020a).\n\n\n3.3.2\nStable isotope analysis\nTo determine geochemical relationships between veins and evaluate the source of mineralizing fluids (e.g., Evans et al., 2012, 2014; Ferrill et al., 2014b, 2017a, 2020a), oxygen and carbon isotope analyses were performed on samples of calcite fracture cements and their associated host rocks, and sulfur isotopic analyses were performed on gypsum veins. Oxygen and carbon stable isotopic analyses of calcite veins and carbonate-rich host rocks were carried out by Yale University Earth System Center for Stable Isotopic Studies on a Thermo MAT 254 Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer equipped with a KIEL IV Carbonate Device. Mineral samples were reacted at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min in 104% phosphoric acid. Results are reported on the Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB) scale by correcting sample data with Yale-in-house carbonate reference materials PX and MERC. Analytical precision (1 sigma) of Quality Control reference carbonate YM (n\u00a0=\u00a014) is 0.03\u2030 for \u03b413C and 0.04\u2030 for \u03b4 18O. Sulfur isotopic samples were analyzed using a Costech elemental analyzer (ECS 4010) connected to a Thermo DeltaPlus Advantage Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. The instrumentation setup utilized a quartz buffer column to correct for isotopic affects from the oxygen in the SO2 molecules (Fry et al., 2002). For each sample, four analytical runs were performed, and the results presented as an average.\nBy integrating the homogenization temperature data from two-phase aqueous inclusions (ThA) and oxygen isotopic data, the oxygen isotopic composition of the fluid that precipitated the vein minerals may be determined, thereby providing information on whether the precipitating fluids were meteoric or formation water. The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite depends on the isotopic composition of the fluid from which it precipitates and the isotopic fractionation between the fluid and the solid. If we assume precipitation in equilibrium with the fluids, the fractionation will depend upon the temperature. If the temperature of the fluid is known from the fluid inclusions, the isotopic composition of the fluid can be calculated using the equation of Friedman and O'Neil (1977) for calcite-water fractionation.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nLithostratigraphy\nThe lithostratigraphic measured section for the Langtry exposure includes 19.1\u00a0m of interbedded mudrock, limestone, and volcanic ash, including the top of Buda Limestone (\u22120.1 to 0.0\u00a0m in section) and 19\u00a0m of overlying Boquillas Formation (Fig. 2). Facies of the Boquillas Formation (and equivalent Eagle Ford Formation) can be assigned to (i) a hydrodynamically recycled association and (ii) a pelagic association (Lehrmann et al., 2019). The hydrodynamically recycled association includes heterolithic packstone\u2013grainstone, intraclastic grainstone conglomerate, and calcareous mudrock with sharp bed contacts, scours, ripple cross-lamination, and hummocky cross-stratification that indicate recycling of sediments by storm waves and bottom currents above storm wave base. In contrast the pelagic association consists of continuous lime packstone to grainstone and chalk beds with intercalated calcareous mudrock with gradational contacts and planar lamination indicating dominant deposition below storm wave base.\nThe lower 6.5\u00a0m of Boquillas Formation in the Langtry section is dominantly composed of highly lenticular limestone (grainstone and packstone) beds with abundant ripple cross lamination and hummocky cross stratification, representative of the hydrodynamically recycled association. A slumped interval with monomict breccia is present in this basal portion of lower Eagle Ford at the Langtry section, including cobble to boulder size clasts composed of pelagic lime packstone\u2013grainstone like the underlying beds. Clasts within this interval are contorted by soft-sediment deformation represented by folding and thickness changes without brittle deformation, indicating that they were unlithified (or only partially lithified) prior to detachment and slumping from the underlying layers and incorporation into debris flows (Lehrmann et al., 2019).\nThe upper portion of the section from 6.5\u00a0m to 19.0\u00a0m contrasts sharply with the lower portion by having a much greater proportion of calcareous mudrock (86% by thickness) and by having highly continuous, planar-bedded pelagic limestone beds characteristic of the pelagic association. Throughout the exposure, the Boquillas Formation contains numerous thin volcanic ash beds that are typically only a few centimeters or decimeters thick (marked with \u201cv\u201d symbols in Fig. 2). In addition to the thin ash beds, the Langtry exposure contains a distinctive 16-cm-thick volcanic tuff at stratigraphic height of 2.3\u00a0m (Fig. 2), which is widespread and can be recognized in several other roadcuts along Highway 90.\n\n\n4.2\nFolds and faults\nFolds at the site include broad gentle folds (interlimb angles 180-120\u00b0; Ramsay, 1967) with wavelengths on the scale of tens of meters and gentle limb dips, as well as narrow kink-band style folds. These kink-band style folds have widths of 1\u20135\u00a0m, represented by planar, moderately to steeply dipping beds between sub-parallel anticlinal and synclinal axial surfaces (1\u20135\u00a0m apart). The most prominent fold in the exposure is a broad gentle anticline with an interlimb angle of 146\u00b0 wavelength of 50\u00a0m, limb dips of 11\u00b0 and 23\u00b0 on east and west limbs respectively, and a fold axis trend\/plunge of 162\u00b0\/01\u00b0 (Fig. 3).\nFaults are relatively rare in the exposure. The largest fault in the exposure, which is nearly perpendicular to layering (Fig. 3a), has a strike\/dip of 015\u00b0\/87\u00b0 and reverse offset of 4\u00a0m. Concentrations of minor reverse and normal faults (with displacements on the order of centimeters) are present in the footwall of the 4-m-displacement reverse fault, and are associated with kink-band style folds.\n\n\n4.3\nVein geometry and cross-cutting relationships\nVeins in the exposure include sets that are (i) parallel to bedding, and (ii) at a moderate to high angle to bedding (Fig. 4\n). Bed-parallel veins include fibrous (selenite) gypsum with vertical or bed-perpendicular fibers (e.g., Fig. 4a and b), and blocky calcite veins (Fig. 4b). The overwhelming majority of bed-parallel veins are filled with fibrous gypsum, although two nearly continuous, blocky calcite veins are traceable across the entire anticline (Fig. 3a and b). Individual gypsum veins range in thickness up to 6\u00a0cm thick (Fig. 4a), and have lateral extents of tens of meters. In one mudstone interval, an en-echelon array is distributed for several meters laterally, suggesting an element of distributed shear during vertical extension (Fig. 4e). In addition, there are a few cases where short gypsum veins occur in en-echelon arrays where vein extension steps across bedding laminae, transferring vertical extension from one level to another vertically separated level (Fig. 4f, g, h). High-angle-to-bedding veins are predominantly filled with white blocky calcite, occasionally with green or brown blocky calcite, and rarely with gypsum. Local ptygmatic-fold structure observed in white-brown high-angle calcite veins is consistent with compaction in a normal faulting stress regime after vein formation, and conjugate high-angle calcite veins are also consistent with a normal faulting stress regime. Veins that are at a high-angle-to-bedding primarily strike NE-SW (Fig. 3a). Cross-cutting and abutting relationships indicate that high-angle calcite veins are typically cut by, but occasionally abutted by, bed-parallel gypsum veins, indicating early formation of the high-angle veins (Fig. 4c). Less commonly, high-angle-to-bedding calcite veins cut the bed-parallel veins (Fig. 4d) indicating high-angle vein formation after bed-parallel veins.\n\n\n4.4\nVein surveys\nAs noted earlier, bed-parallel veins are best developed in the broad anticline (Fig. 3a). Five bed-perpendicular veins surveys were performed across the anticline to document and quantify the occurrence, intensity, thickness, and strain represented by veins that are parallel (or at a low angle) to bedding (Fig. 3b). For consistency, each survey was conducted perpendicular to bedding from an upper marker bed (stratigraphic height \u223c13.1\u00a0m in the measured section) downward for at least 1.5\u00a0m through a mudrock package and underlying limestone to the top of the next lower mudrock interval at a stratigraphic height of \u223c11.6\u00a0m. These surveys document the thickness (i.e., mechanical aperture; Marrett, 1996; Ortega et al., 2006; Hooker et al., 2013) and mineralogy (calcite versus gypsum) of veins, and the thickness of host rock between veins along the bed-perpendicular survey lines (Table 1\n). From these measurements, (i) fracture intensity was calculated by dividing the number of veins by the summed host-rock thickness between veins (i.e., the initial thickness prior to vein extension), and (ii) percent vein extension was calculated by dividing summed vein thickness by summed host-rock thickness between veins (initial thickness), multiplied by 100.\nIntensity of all bed-parallel veins (measured along bed-perpendicular scanlines) shows close correspondence to structural position across the fold (Table 1; Fig. 5\na). Fracture intensities of 1.8 and 1.4 per m (represented entirely by calcite veins) were measured in the syncline hinges on the east and west sides of the anticline, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, much higher fracture intensities of 18.4, 21.8, and 9.9 per m (dominated by gypsum veins) were measured in the east limb, crest, and west limb of the anticline, respectively.\nGreatest magnitudes of bed-perpendicular extension were measured within the anticline, with 13.5% in the east limb, 11.8% in the crest, and 6.5% in the west limb (Fig. 5b). The majority of measured extension is accommodated by gypsum veins at these survey locations \u2013 13.0, 11.4, and 5.9% in the east limb, crest, and west limb, respectively (Fig. 5b). Bed-perpendicular extension due to calcite vein formation is 0.5, 0.4, and 0.7% in the east limb, crest, and west limb, respectively. The synclinal hinges to the east and west have 3.8 and 1.0% bed normal extension that is accommodated entirely by calcite vein formation, with no gypsum veins observed at these survey stations.\nCollectively, both the intensity of bed-parallel veins and their associated strain indicate a clear structural association of bed-parallel gypsum veins with the anticlinal fold. These observations are consistent with bed-parallel vein formation during folding.\n\n\n4.5\nCross-section construction and analysis\nCross section analysis of the fold was carried out to assess whether the relationship between structural position and bed-perpendicular extension represented by bed-parallel veins is present throughout the anticline, including higher in the section that was not safely accessible via extension ladder. 3D polyline interpretations of seven prominent horizons identified in the georeferenced digital outcrop (Fig. 6\na; see https:\/\/bit.ly\/3egiGrO for 3D visualization of the digital outcrop) were projected onto a cross section plane to construct a down-plunge view of the anticline. In order to quantify the location and magnitude of deviations from constant bed thickness throughout the cross section, and model vein-associated thickness changes across the structure, 2D bed construction was performed by using the constant-bed-thickness technique in Move 2019.1\u2122, with constructed bed geometries provided by projected polyline interpretations (Fig. 6b). For these prominent horizons, measured stratigraphic thicknesses at the eastern edge of the anticline were used as template thicknesses to construct a theoretical base of bed interval that would preserve layer thickness. The deviation between these constructed constant thickness beds and the observed beds permits visualization of the magnitude and distribution of bed thickening within each interval.\nResults from constant-thickness bed construction through the anticline show a systematic pattern of increased separation between constructed beds and greater total thicknesses towards the center of the fold structure (Fig. 6b). Bed-perpendicular distance measurements between projected polylines in cross section view (Fig. 6b) record bulk thickening of strata towards the crest of the anticline, from 7.7\u00a0m at the eastern edge of the structure, to 8.4\u00a0m at its crest. If increased stratal thicknesses towards the crest of the anticline are entirely accounted for by bed-perpendicular extension and associated vein formation (Fig. 6c), cross section measurements suggest total vertical extension of approximately 12% in the crest of the structure. This value is in general agreement with vein survey measurements (Table 1) from the lower part of the outcrop (Fig. 6a), suggesting that similar amounts of bed-perpendicular extension occurred through the exposed succession at the anticline crest. Close agreement between digitally constructed thickness changes across the structure and measured vein-related extension suggests that all or nearly all fold-related thickening and fold amplification within the anticline can be attributed to vein formation, rather than to ductile thickening of stratigraphic units. Estimated bulk thicknesses and extents of veins between interpreted stratigraphic horizons are provided graphically in Fig. 6c.\nExcess area and predicted depth to detachment analysis (Epard and Groshong, 1993; Groshong, 2015) in cross section view (Fig. 6d) suggest that the detachment level for the anticline lies approximately 11\u00a0m below the lowest continuously exposed stratigraphic horizon in the anticline (Fig. 6d). This horizon has a stratigraphic height of ca. 11.6\u00a0m above the top of the Buda Limestone (Fig. 2), which suggests that the detachment level for the Langtry anticline is along the top of the Buda Limestone. A high R2 value (0.99; Fig. 6e) for excess area vs. depth to reference level measurements suggest that the trend for these data is best approximated by a straight line fit and linear regression. As noted by Epard and Groshong (1993), a straight line in excess area vs. depth to reference level space records detachment folding, whereas thrust-fault-related folds (Epard and Groshong, 1993) or detachment folds with multiple detachments (Gonzalez-Mieres and Suppe, 2006) show abrupt changes in slope. We therefore interpret the Langtry anticline as a detachment fold with no intermediate detachments within the exposed structure.\n\n\n4.6\nVein fluid inclusions and stable isotope geochemistry\nVeins and associated host rock samples were collected from five locations in the anticline at the Langtry fold exposure, including blocky calcite and fibrous gypsum fills (Fig. 7\n). The samples include the following:\n\n(i)\nBed-parallel green blocky calcite vein (1\u00a0cm thick) overlain by white fibrous gypsum vein (1\u00a0cm thick) on the west limb of the anticline (bedding and vein orientation\u00a0=\u00a0180\u00b0\/10\u00b0) \u2013 Sample SN1149-040,\n\n\n(ii)\nSteeply dipping (035\u00b0\/67\u00b0) brown and white blocky calcite vein on east limb of anticline (bedding orientation\u00a0=\u00a0005\u00b0\/07\u00b0) \u2013 Sample SN1149-041,\n\n\n(iii)\nSteeply dipping (036\u00b0\/84\u00b0) green blocky calcite vein with euhedral crystal termination into vuggy porosity along vein centerline. Sampled vein is part of en echelon vein array on east limb of anticline (bedding orientation\u00a0=\u00a0005\u00b0\/07\u00b0) \u2013 Sample SN1149-042,\n\n\n(iv)\nBed-parallel (047\u00b0\/10\u00b0) clear to white fibrous gypsum vein, 0.5\u20134\u00a0cm thick \u2013 Sample 1149\u2013043,\n\n\n(v)\nBed-parallel (023\u00b0\/09\u00b0) clear to white fibrous gypsum vein, 4\u20136.5\u00a0cm thick \u2013 Sample 1149\u2013044.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.1\nFluid inclusion results\nAll calcite samples contain dark brown to black single-phase inclusions that are interpreted to be degraded hydrocarbons or bitumen (Table 2\n). These inclusions generally do not fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light, indicating that they have lost their aromatic components (Alpern et al., 1993). Because they lack vapor bubbles, these inclusions are not suitable for microthermometric analysis. Colorless to brown single-phase liquid hydrocarbon inclusions are also present in the samples, and these exhibit a wide range of UV fluorescence colors. Colorless single-phase inclusions that do not fluoresce are interpreted to be aqueous (saline to fresh water). Aqueous inclusions that lack a vapor bubble are common regionally in the Boquillas Formation (and equivalent Eagle Ford; Ferrill et al., 2014b; 2017a) and overlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a) and indicate the fluids were trapped at relatively low temperatures and pressures, and that there was not enough energy to nucleate a vapor bubble upon cooling and are hence in a metastable state (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The origin of these inclusions is extremely difficult to determine due to low number and dispersal among other inclusions.\nTwo adjacent high-angle-to-bedding veins in the Boquillas Formation (1149\u2013041 and 1149\u2013042; Fig. 7e and f) have multiple stages of blocky and crack-seal calcite mineralization (Ramsay, 1980; Bons et al., 2012), with one individual vein having up to 100 individual opening events (Fig. 7e). The \u2018brown-white\u2019 vein (1149\u2013041) contains primarily hydrocarbon inclusions, while the \u2018green calcite\u2019 vein (1149\u2013042) contains primarily aqueous inclusions.\nOnly one sample (SN1149-042) provided two-phase aqueous inclusions suitable for microthermometric analysis (Fig. 8\na). Upon heating, the two-phase aqueous inclusions homogenized to the liquid phase between 67.0 and 81.2\u00a0\u00b0C. Tm values are different for each assemblage, with one being 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C, the other \u22122.2\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating salinities of 0.0 and 3.6\u00a0wt % NaCl equivalent (Table 2, Fig. 8a). First ice melting (eutectic) was extremely difficult to observe due to the small size of the inclusions, but it is above\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u221220.8\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating NaCl-rich fluids (Roedder, 1984).\n\n\n4.6.2\nHydrocarbon inclusion UV fluorescence\nThis study site has a large variety of inclusion fluorescence colors compared with other sites sampled in the region (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2014b; 2017a; 2020a), with liquid hydrocarbon inclusions occurring in both calcite and gypsum veins (Fig. 8b). Calcite from bed-parallel vein sample SN1149-040 contains inclusions that fluoresce yellow-green whereas gypsum from that same sample contains inclusions that fluoresce pale blue. Similarly, liquid hydrocarbon inclusions in bed-parallel fibrous gypsum vein sample SN1149-044 also fluoresce pale blue. Steeply dipping vein SN1140-041 contains inclusions that fluoresce yellow-green to light blue, and a separate population that fluoresce orange (Fig. 8b). The fluorescence colors of liquid hydrocarbon inclusions in the calcite and gypsum veins indicate \u223c25\u201337\u00b0 API gravity oils, which suggests that the oils were derived from sources that range in maturity from early to peak maturity (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.6.3\nStable isotope analysis results\nStable isotope data from the bed-parallel and high-angle-to-bedding calcite veins show a very consistent pattern of veins being 3.5 to 4.0 per mil lower in \u03b418O than the host rocks (Fig. 8c). \u03b413C values are similar but slightly higher than the values from the host rocks. All vein isotopic values are significantly different from their associated host rocks (Table 2, Fig. 8c), indicating that this was an open fluid system during vein formation. Both the \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of the host rock compositions do not correspond to values expected for Late Cretaceous carbonates (Fig. 8c; Veizer et al., 1999) suggesting whole rock alteration since the Cretaceous. The three gypsum veins analyzed have \u03b434S values that are low, \u22127.1 to \u22120.9 (Table 2).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nBed-parallel opening-mode veins and fold amplification\nHorizontal and subhorizontal bed-parallel opening-mode veins accommodate vertical extension, and reflect a vertical minimum principal compressive stress and a thrust faulting stress regime. In the Langtry fold exposure, bed-parallel blocky calcite veins in the surveyed interval are present across the structure with no major change in vein thickness or number of veins, and no clear relationship between structural position and the occurrence of bed-parallel blocky calcite veins. We therefore interpret the bed-parallel blocky calcite veins at the study site as having formed prior to the bed-parallel fibrous gypsum veins. The positive correlation between intensity of, and vertical extension by, gypsum veins across the anticline indicates that vein formation contributed strongly to fold amplification. Cross-section construction and analysis results show a close match between cross-section-based estimation of thickening of the survey interval and corresponding outcrop vein survey data across the anticline structure. Furthermore, cross-section analysis higher in the fold, above survey locations, shows similar thickness increases in the upper part of the structure, and systematic vein-related thickening and associated amplification of the Langtry anticline (Fig. 6d). The bed-parallel fibrous gypsum veins in the Langtry fold exposure are kinematically associated with folding, bed-perpendicular dilation, and fold amplification (Fig. 9\n), but do not reflect a flexural slip mechanism. These structures are kinematically more akin to saddle reef veins, although saddle reef veins are most commonly described in the hinges of tight folds (Ramsay and Huber, 1987). Excess area and depth to detachment analysis (Fig. 6d and e) suggest that the Langtry anticline is a detachment fold, with the position of the underlying detachment at the top of the Buda Limestone. This result, along with the lack of field evidence for significant flexural slip at the site, provide a compelling case for the Langtry anticline being a detachment fold, rather than a thrust-fault-related anticline.\n\n\n5.2\nBeef veins not associated with hydrocarbon generation\nFluid-inclusion trapping-temperature data, along with inferred timing and regional tectonic interpretation, suggest that vein formation occurred at depths on the order of 2\u20133\u00a0km. Source rock analysis from a sample of unoxidized organic-rich mudrock from this location (6.3\u00a0wt % total organic content; from stratigraphic height of 8.4\u00a0m above the top of the Buda Limestone) indicated that the rocks never reached hydrocarbon maturation conditions (Ferrill et al., 2020a). The fact that these source rocks did not reach hydrocarbon maturation conditions indicates that the trapped oil inclusions represent migrated oils rather than generated in situ.\nVein formation likely involved pore fluid overpressure that reduced the minimum principal effective stress into the tensile regime to generate tensile failure. As these strata never reached hydrocarbon maturation, this local overpressure cannot be explained by in situ hydrocarbon generation and expulsion. Elevated pore fluid pressure can be explained in low-permeability fine-grained strata like the Boquillas Formation by compaction without drainage, regardless of stress regime. Initial vertical compaction in the early normal faulting stress regime would have given way to horizontal contraction associated with Laramide shortening that likely continued to elevate pore pressure to the point of tensile failure in the thrust faulting stress regime (Ferrill et al., 2021). The presence of oil inclusions in both the calcite and gypsum veins indicates that both sets of vein were forming concurrently with hydrocarbon migration.\n\n\n5.3\nFluid history and conditions\nAs noted earlier, the vein calcite is between 4 and 5 per mil lower in \u03b418O and up to 3 per mil lower in \u03b413C than the host rock (Fig. 8c; open squares represent host rock values), suggesting an external fluid source. Hydrocarbon inclusions represent migrated oil, as discussed above. Collectively, fluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis of veins from the Langtry fold exposure of the Boquillas Formation provide evidence for an evolving fluid system that was generally open to external fluids as indicated by the wide variation in hydrocarbon inclusion fluorescence, and the mutual occurrence of both calcite and gypsum veins.\nCalculated fluid composition from sample SN1149-042 \u2013 the only one with ThA data \u2013 gives a \u03b418O value of \u22123.78\u2030 Vienna standard mean ocean water or V-SMOW, indicating a meteoric isotopic fluid composition (Fig. 8d). The oxygen equilibrium fluid values along with the low salinity of the aqueous inclusions confirm influx of meteoric water to at least the depth of the formation in this study. Aqueous fluids have a bimodal salinity distribution of 3.7 and 0.0\u00a0wt % equiv. The low salinities suggest an influx of meteoric groundwater which is supported by the oxygen isotopic equilibrium fluid value. The epifluorescence of the hydrocarbon inclusions in 1149\u2013041 suggest that a later fluid influx brought in more mature hydrocarbons.\n\nRose (2016) estimated the maximum depth of burial for the Boquillas Formation at Lozier Canyon (30\u00a0km WNW of our study area) to be 1.83\u20132.38\u00a0km, with a median of 2.24\u00a0km, and the West Comstock field site (29\u00a0km ESE of our study area) to be 1.34\u20131.68\u00a0km, with a median of 1.52\u00a0km. He estimated paleogeothermal gradients of 22\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 and 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 for the Lozier Canyon and Comstock West areas, respectively. Using the 23\u00a0\u00b0C km\u22121 geothermal gradient value, an average surface temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C (as described by Ferrill et al., 2020a), and the homogenization temperatures of 67\u201381\u00a0\u00b0C, estimated trapping depths at the Langtry fold site were 2.0\u20132.7\u00a0km. These depths are consistent with previously published estimates of Boquillas Formation maximum burial depth at Lozier Canyon and West Comstock (Rose, 2016). The results from the Langtry fold exposure are also generally consistent with estimates from fluid inclusion analysis of calcite vein cement in a normal fault in the Austin Chalk west of Langtry (10\u00a0km WNW of our study site), where Ferrill et al. (2020a) estimated overburden depths of 1.6\u20132.4\u00a0km at the time of faulting and vein formation and interpreted vein formation near maximum burial depth for these rocks.\n\n\n5.4\nStress switching from strike-slip regime to thrust-faulting regime and back again\nAs discussed in the results section, NE-SW striking early high-angle-to-bedding opening-mode veins are cut by bed-parallel opening-mode veins (Fig. 4c), and also cut by later high-angle-to-bedding opening-mode veins (Fig. 4d; also Fig. 8c in Ferrill et al., 2021). Opening-mode veins form perpendicular to the minimum principal compressive stress direction (Hancock, 1985), thus the vein orientations provide a record of this principal stress direction (Fig. 10\n). The switching from NW-SE-directed extension that produced steep NE-striking calcite veins to vertical extension represents a local switch from a normal-faulting or strike-slip-faulting stress regime to a thrust-faulting stress regime (Fig. 10). Compaction and local development of a ptygmatic structure of the white-brown calcite vein (Sample SN1149-041) is consistent with a normal-faulting stress regime, which these strata likely experienced prior to Laramide compression. The initial normal-faulting stress regime would have progressively altered to a strike-slip then a thrust faulting stress regime associated with NE-directed Laramide compression (Fig. 10; Ferrill et al., 2021). Repeated switching between near vertical and subhorizontal opening-mode fracturing suggests a stress regime dominated by a consistent maximum horizontal stress direction. Switching between (i) a strike-slip regime with a vertical intermediate principal compressive stress, and (ii) a thrust faulting stress regime with a vertical minimum principal stress, and a consistent NE-directed maximum principal stress direction, suggests that the magnitudes of the minimum and intermediate stress magnitudes were similar. With eventual post-Laramide tectonic relaxation, regional stress conditions eventually returned to a normal faulting stress regime (Fig. 10).\n\n\n5.5\nCalcite versus gypsum vein cement\nAs discussed in section 4, field observations show a complex relative timing relationship between gypsum and calcite veins that indicates a transitioning back and forth of preferred mineral precipitation. In limestones and calcareous mudrocks, calcite tends to be highly mobile and is typically the most common vein mineral (Gale et al., 2014). Occurrence of gypsum beef is most common in evaporites or lacustrine strata (see review by Cobbold et al., 2013; also see Meng et al., 2017), and is less common in marine mudrock like the Boquillas Formation. To switch from calcite (calcium carbonate) to gypsum (calcium sulfate) vein cementation requires a source of sulfur. Two explanations for gypsum vein material include (i) oxidation of pyrite by meteoric water to produce sulfuric acid, which dissolves calcium carbonate and results in gypsum precipitation (Tisato et al., 2012), and (ii) upwardly migrating H2S gas mixing with meteoric water to produce sulfuric acid, which dissolves calcium carbonate and results in gypsum precipitation (Hill, 1990).\nAs noted in section 4.3.3, we observed depleted \u03b434S values of \u22127.1 to \u22120.9 per mil in the three bed-parallel gypsum vein samples. Low \u03b434S values have been ascribed to the oxidation of sulfide formed by microbial reduction of sulfate (e.g., Kirkland, 1982; Pierre and Rouchy, 2020). Microbial reactions lead to enrichment of 34S in residual sulfate and to depletion of 34S in diagenetic sulfide (Thode et al., 1954; Jones and Starkey, 1957).\nSimilarly depleted \u03b434S values were reported from pyrite in Permian limestones of the Guadalupe Mountains (New Mexico). Even lower \u03b434S values have been measured in gypsum in cave deposits in the Guadalupe Mountains, which has been attributed to H2S migration out of the adjacent basin mixing with meteoric water to produce sulfuric acid (Hill, 1990; Jagnow et al., 2000). Hill (1990) used extremely depleted \u03b434S values as low as \u221225.6 from cave gypsum in the Guadalupe Mountains to argue that H2S sourced sulfur for gypsum formation, rather than pyrite. Therefore, an alternative origin of the gypsum is from H2S released from a deeper fluid reservoir.\nRegionally, the Buda Limestone and Edwards Group strata that underlie the Boquillas Formation are often found to have high concentrations of H2S gas (e.g., Ludwig et al., 1982; Davis et al., 2016), and faults have been interpreted as pathways for vertical migration of H2S gas (Ludwig et al., 1982; Goldhaber et al., 1983). Also, pyrite is common in the Boquillas Formation (Lock and Peschier, 2006; Lock et al., 2010), as well as the overlying Austin Chalk (Ferrill et al., 2020a), and underlying Buda Limestone (Valencia et al., 2021). As noted in section 4, the low salinities from aqueous inclusions and stable isotope data from the Langtry fold exposure indicate the presence of meteoric water during vein formation. With meteoric water circulation and presence of pyrite and H2S to source sulfur, resulting sulfuric acid production could have led to dissolution of calcium carbonate and precipitation of gypsum. Evidence of dissolution of limestone beds is observable in the exposure (e.g., Fig. 11\n), with dissolution often localized in steeper fold limbs and adjacent to faults in the exposure.\nIn the current study, we see evidence of meteoric water circulation to depths of 2\u20133\u00a0km, consistent with interpretation of deep circulation (to depths of 3\u20135\u00a0km) associated with contractional structures in the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico (Evans and Fischer, 2012). Switching between calcite and gypsum vein deposition could be driven by episodic influx of meteoric water, episodic influx of H2S gas, or opening and closing of fluid pathways, all of which are likely to be influenced by evolving development and connectivity of fault and fracture pathways during progressive deformation.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBed-parallel opening-mode veins in the Langtry anticline developed during fold growth, amplifying the anticline. Vein survey data and cross-section analysis based on a georectified photogrammetric digital outcrop show thickening through the fold, with thickening represented in the outcrop by increased intensity and overall thickness of fibrous gypsum veins within the anticline. Field observations and cross section analysis suggest that the Langtry anticline is a detachment fold, with the position of the detachment at the stratigraphic contact between the Boquillas Formation and the underlying Buda Limestone. Our interpretations of beef vein formation during early fold amplification contrast with published examples of beef veins developed in horizontal strata, or late bed-parallel opening-mode veins formed during late-stage fold tightening (saddle reefs). Vein formation and folding were active at depths on the order of 2\u20133\u00a0km, based on analysis of two-phase aqueous fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures in strata that never reached conditions for hydrocarbon maturation based on source rock analysis.\nVein observations provide evidence for cross-cutting and abutting relationships that suggest that the stress regime switched multiple times: (i) NE-striking near-vertical veins are consistent with an early normal-faulting to strike-slip regime, (ii) horizontal to gently dipping bed-parallel opening-mode veins formed in a thrust-faulting stress regime (Laramide orogeny), and (iii) NE-striking near-vertical veins indicate return to strike-slip or normal-faulting stress regime later in the Laramide stress cycle.\nThe vein sequence at Langtry records transitions between calcite and gypsum mineralization. We interpret that gypsum mineralization indicates meteoric groundwater and a sulfur source, which may have been related to pyrite or H2S interaction with meteoric water to form sulfuric acid, dissolution of carbonate, and deposition of gypsum as an auxiliary mineral fill in opening-mode fractures. Switching between calcite and gypsum mineralization may have been driven by episodic influx of meteoric water or episodic influx of H2S gas, likely related to opening or closing of fault and fracture controlled fluid pathways during contractional folding.\n\n\nCredit authorship contribution statement\n\nDavid A.

the typical Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic district in the southwestern margin of the Yangtze Craton, Southwestern China, remains controversial. A systematic study of the mercury (Hg) concentrations and Hg isotopic compositions of the Hg deposit at Paiting was conducted to constrain the sources of metals. Mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes with slight positive \u0394199Hg (0.03\u2030 to 0.22\u2030) was observed in the Hg ore samples, indicating that Hg transported by the ore fluids was primarily derived from the Cambrian black shale as these rocks show similar \u0394199Hg signatures (\u22120.02\u2030 to 0.08\u2030). Based on these newly obtained Hg isotope ratios, we propose that deep hydrothermal fluids promoted the mobilization of Hg in Hg-bearing strata (i.e., Cambrian Niutitang Formation black shale) in the paleo-basin sedimentary strata to form Hg-enriched fluids. The Hg-enriched fluids flowed and permeated from the lower to the upper strata during mineralization and were transported to the platform margin slope facies along faults, followed by Hg precipitation to form Hg deposits. Hg isotope ratios could be a robust tracer to distinguish the metal sources of hydrothermal Hg deposits.\n               ","1":"\n                  Carbonation of ultramafic rocks is a key piece of the global carbon cycle taking place from the seafloor to the surficial environment and becoming particularly efficient in the genesis of ultramafic-hosted magnesite deposits in the shallow crust. Even though these are exceptional occurrences for the study of carbonation reactions and the implementation of engineered CO2 storage solutions, their genetic model, in particular the role of tectonics and source of CO2, is still debated. In this study, we focus on the Castiglioncello magnesite deposit hosted in the Ligurian ophiolite of central Tuscany (Italy). Textural, mineralogical, and isotopic data indicate that here carbonation is the result of a serpentinite-hosted epithermal system where mantle CO2 mixed with meteoric water, became enriched in Mg2+ through serpentine alteration and precipitated magnesite in response to tectonic activity. More specifically, carbonation was driven by subsequent tectonic events during the Apennine orogenesis which: i) developed structural traps that allowed the concentration of CO2 into serpentinite lenses; ii) created crustal-scale pathways for the rising of mantle CO2 into the shallow crust; and iii) opened dilatational fault jogs where magnesite precipitated. Cyclical fracturation guaranteed the necessary permeability for the ingress of multiple batches of fluids, prolonged alteration, and repeated precipitation of magnesite, dolomite, and opal-CT\/chalcedony. Our results highlight a fundamental control of tectonics on carbonation of ultramafic rocks in the shallow crust and the importance of appropriate crustal architecture for developing epithermal carbonation systems. Syn-tectonic epithermal carbonation systems provide an alternative view on CO2 storage in ultramafic rocks compared to the better-known post-tectonic supergene systems. The mantle origin of CO2 indicates that in extensional settings, transfer zones can be conveyors of CO2, and possibly other volatiles, from the Earth\u2019s mantle to the surface.\n               ","2":"\n                  Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is a multi-criteria decision-making process that identifies and prioritises potential zones for mineral exploration. Multi-index overlay and fuzzy logic models were employed in this paper to conduct GIS-based MPM of the Ahafo gold district, which is located on the northwestern margin of the Sefwi granitegreenstone belt in Ghana. Mineralisation in the area is structurally controlled with a high degree of hydrothermal alteration. Therefore, the mineral systems approach was used to translate the understanding of orogenic gold hydrothermal system into mappable exploration criteria, leading to the generation of nine evidential layers. These layers represented mappable spatial proxies for active fluid pathways (i.e. proximity to NEstriking basement faults: D2 to D3), physical traps (i.e. proximity to N- to NNE-strike sinistral fault: D4; proximity to litho-contacts; proximity to the intersection of N- to NNE- and NE-strike faults; density of N- to NNE- and NE-strike faults; litho-competency contrast), and chemical traps (i.e. proximity to Fe-rich dykes; litho-reactivity contrast; proximity to hydrothermal alteration zone), all of which are critical for hydrothermal fluid migration, focusing, and gold deposition. Weights and confidence factors were assigned to the evidential layers in the fuzzy logic approach based on experts' knowledge of how the layers are relevant to orogenic gold mineralising processes. In contrast, weights were assigned to layers in the multi-index overlay model based on prediction-area (P-A) plots and normalised densities, limiting the subjectivity of assigning weights to the layers. In order to delineate potential zones for lode-gold mineralisation in the study area, the weighted evidential layers were combined to create multi-index overlay and fuzzy prospectivity maps. The continuous prospective scores of the prospectivity maps were discretised and classified using a concentration-area (C-A) fractal model. The resulting discretised prospectivity maps based on the location of 18 known lode-gold occurrences (i.e. deposits and economic prospects) were further evaluated using P-A plots. The discretised multi-index overlay prospectivity map predicted 76% of known lode-gold occurrences, with 24% of the study area as prospective, whereas the discretised fuzzy prospectivity map predicted 74% of known lode-gold occurrences, with 26% of the study area as prospective. The high potential zones identified on the prospectivity maps were spatially located in areas with structural complexity along: (i) NE-SW structural trends (i.e. 40\u00b0\u201350\u00b0); and (ii) secondary structural trends in the NS to NNE-SSW direction (i.e. 0\u00b0\u201310\u00b0 and 15\u00b0\u201325\u00b0).

This deposit located in the superimposed tectonic setting of the Qinzhou\u2013Hangzhou and Nanling metallogenic belts. Skarn-type W\u2013Sn orebodies and hydrothermal vein-type Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu orebodies located in the faults and contact zone between late Jurassic porphyry and late Paleozoic limestone. Many studies have been conducted on the geological and geochemical characteristics of the deposit, but the comprehensive understanding of the deep-spreading pattern of the tectono-geochemical anomalies remains unclear. The geochemical data of tectonites in deep level adits (\u2212136\u00a0m, \u2212176\u00a0m, \u2212256\u00a0m and \u2212296\u00a0m) were studied the distribution characteristics of ore-forming trace elements and the depth index of tectonic geochemical anomalies. Finally, four element combination anomalies were extrated from the cluster analysis and factor analysis. They are generally consistent with the known Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn and W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi metallogenic systems. In addition, from altered porphyry to limestone of the Shidengzi Formation, the plane and profile anomaly contour maps delineated by different factors have regular variation characteristics. High anomalous values usually occur in the part where ore-forming porphyry changes from convex to concave. Comprehensive study trace element combination anomalies shows that the connection line of high value anomalous zones corresponds to the swelling and shrinking characteristics of porphyry, showing periodic wave-like changes. Thus, the deep index and deep-spreading pattern of ore-controlling structure were constructed. The length, width and height of the deep-seated orebodies indicated by the main anomalies are evaluated. The anomalous vertical variation indicates the migration of ore-forming fluid from SE to NW to the shallow. The strike of orebodiesy are consistent with the ore-controlling faults and dip to SE. Overall, the tectonic geochemical anomalies are consistent with the locations where the orebodies were identified, indicating that the method is feasible and effective.

The atypical Ermioni VMS deposit, with estimated reserves of\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.0 Mt, comprises almost monomineralic and barren pyrite (\u226595\u00a0vol%), followed by minor chalcopyrite and traces of sphalerite.

Simple cooling, seawater contamination up to 35\u00a0vol% and wall-rock interaction of decreasing water-to-rock ratios (from\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800 down to\u00a0\u223c\u00a020) were the mechanisms that contributed to the observed alteration patterns, i.e., silica, silica-chlorite, silica-epidote (\u00b1albite-chlorite-sericite), grunerite and albite-prehnite zones. Remobilization of base metals from the footwall volcaniclastic and ultramafic rocks, combined with sulfidation during hydrothermal circulation, led to the increase of the log\u03b1\n                     FeCl\n                     + and eventually of the log\u03b1\n                     CuCl\n                     0 values of the Karakasi stringer ore fluid and provoked the precipitation of almost monomineralic pyrite.

The barite mineralization in WBC, Central India, occurs as veins and fracture fillings along faults are activated or reactivated as a consequence of rifting of\u00a0\u2013\u00a01.5\u20131.6\u00a0Ga Pranhita-Godavari (PG) basin. The barite mineralization is hosted in ca. 1.6\u00a0Ga Mul granite of WBC. We present the first comprehensive, integrated field and laboratory studies approach using structural mapping, fluid inclusion, Sulfur, and Sr-Isotope geochemistry, mineral, and REE geochemistry to characterize barite mineralization ore-forming processes, a fluid source, and structural control. The host granite is intensely altered with evidence of hydrothermal mineralization in the form of silicification and hematitisation. Both sulfide-free (Brt-I) and sulfide-bearing (Brt-II) barites occur in the study area. Besides, barites with fluorite (Brt-III) were also observed in minor concentrations. The mineralization is associated with quartz-calcite vein, and the barite is accompanied by galena, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. Petrographic observations, fluid inclusion, and isotope data suggest a bimodal evolution of the mother brine viz. the oxidative source forms sulfide-free high-salinity brine and reductive low-salinity sulfide-bearing aqueous fluid formed by interaction with reducing agent causing hydrothermal barite mineralization in the study area. The source for the hydrotherms responsible for the formation of barite and galena in association with the quartz-barite vein is, in all probability, granitic magma. Incompatible elements like Ba, Pb and volatiles like S, preferentially concentrated in late magmatic hydrothermal fluids, got emplaced along the structurally weak zones in the interior of the granite pluton. The combined 87Sr\/86Sr and \u03b434S\u2030 data suggest mixing fluids from diverse sources, including magmatic, marine, and crustal fluids. Low 87Sr\/86Sr (<0.707) and high \u03b434S(>10\u2030) are indicative of alteration products of granite that were subsequently mixed with submarine hydrothermal fluid mobilized through the Mesoproterozoic PG rift system. This regional rifting event provided pathways for fluid flow and ore formation along faults\/fracture systems (F2 and F3 fault systems) in the host Mul granite of WBC. The F2 fault system, sympathetic to the PG rift, is deep-seated and contains mainly barites of magmatic origin besides the minor marine signature. The F3 cross faults, developed across the gneissic foliation of TTG gneisses and charnockites, can be traced to the PG basin's younger marine sediments, host barites of dominantly marine signature.\n                  The Ba\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0F mineralization in the study area is a perspective for regional exploration for REE-Ba-F in central India and elsewhere in a similar geological milieu. The epigenetic-submarine hydrothermal vein-type barite mineralization hosted in granite, WBC differs from Sedex, VMS, Carlin, or Orogenic type barite deposits, which has a great deal of replicability and suitability for future exploration targeting.\n               ","6":"\n                  The northern marginal part of the Polish Carpathian Foredeep hosts numerous native sulfur deposits associated with the Middle Miocene evaporite horizon. These deposits reveal lithological zoning, wherein both the barren and sulfur-bearing limestone zones are embedded within the gypsum basin area (zone). However, such zoning is incompatible with the bioepigenetic formation model of native sulfur deposits. Hence, their genesis remains enigmatic. Regional variations in stable oxygen and carbon isotope values of the limestones disclosed in the Osiek\u2013Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski native sulfur deposit are inconsistent with the molecular replacement of solid sulfate by calcium carbonate and native sulfur accumulations that expand from a fault zone into the gypsum basin. Instead, the distribution patterns of stable isotopes and sedimentological data suggest that a very shallow freshwater-dominated sedimentary\u2013diagenetic environment developed in the hypersaline basin\u2019s marginal zone, where the mixing of meteoric and highly saline water, as well as various bacterial processes, were responsible for lithological zoning and native sulfur distribution. The proposed results necessitate a reinterpretation of the epigenetic model of native sulfur ore formation.\n               ","7":"\n                  The South China uranium metallogenic province is an important hydrothermal uranium metallogenic region in China, which is spatially and temporally associated with the Cretaceous-Neogene red beds. Previous studies suggest that the red beds might have played critical role in the ore-forming processes by providing oxidizing fluids. However, the effects of the red beds on fluid flow are poorly understood. In this study, numerical modeling was conducted to investigate the roles of red beds on ore-forming fluid flow in the Xiangshan basin in Jiangxi Province, hosting the largest volcanic hydrothermal uranium deposit in China. The modeling results show that the variation of the slope gradient of the red beds greatly affects the fluid flow patterns, whereas the change of thickness and permeability of the red beds has little influence on fluid flow pattern. The fluid can circulate into the volcanic and basement rocks driven by topographic relief of the red beds. Furthermore, for models with fault, although the fluid velocities in the fault were more than one order of magnitude larger than those in the surrounding strata, the overall fluid flow patterns in the strata did not show great variation. The modelling results suggest that the topographic relief of the red beds may have driven the oxidizing fluids into the underlying rocks which are necessary for uranium mineralization in the Xiangshan basin.\n               ","8":"\n                  Late Cretaceous granitic rocks occur in the Gejiu ore district to the east and west of the N-S striking Gejiu Fault, whereas major Sn deposits are only known to occur to the east of the Gejiu Fault. Comparison of the whole-rock chemistry, the apatite trace-element chemistry, and zircon Hf and O isotope data of the various granites demonstrates that fertile granites occur to both sides of the Gejiu fault. The results demonstrate that the c. 83\u00a0Ma old granitic intrusions (i) have similar magma sources, which are dominated by metasedimentary rocks that had experienced intense chemical weathering, resulting in reduced melts, (ii) had similar melting conditions, i.e., high temperature biotite dehydration melting, and (iii) in part had experienced large extents of fractional crystallization. The most evolved granites to both sides of the Gejiu Fault have the characteristics typical of tin granites. Therefore, the absence of major deposits to the west of the Gejiu Fault is not due to the absence of fertile granites. The areas to the east and the west of the Gejiu Fault, however, have fundamentally different fault pattern, which indicates different orientation of the stress field to both sides of the Gejiu Fault at the time of the emplacement of the Cretaceous granites. Late Cretaceous dextral movement along the Ailaoshan Fault Zone resulted in a (trans)tensional setting in areas to the east of the Gejiu Fault and in a (trans)pressional setting to the west of that fault. We speculate that the tectonic setting influences the potential for mineralization because the Sn bearing fluids need efficient pathways to transporting metals from the roof zone of the batholith into the wall rocks. In contrast to regional compression, hydraulic fracturing in an overall extensional setting has the potential to develop efficient fluid pathways and, thus, may lead to major ore deposits. To the west of the Gejiu Fault, however, granite intrusions in an overall compressional setting are likely to develop no or only small mineralization.\n               ","9":"\n                  The Hunjiang basin in the northeastern North China block is host to a wide range of ore deposit types that are currently exploited by more than 100 past and producing mines. Extensive field and laboratory investigations were conducted to summarize the regional metallogeny, classify the different deposit types, and to place the deposits within a regional geologic and tectonic context. The Archean basement of the basin is host to magnetite deposits that have been affected by high-grade metamorphism. In addition, Proterozoic magmatic Cu-Ni deposit and orogenic Au deposits that are likely of Mesozoic age are located in the metamorphic basement rocks. Polymetallic Co-Cu and Ni-Co-Cu deposits are located in Proterozoic schists within the basin and are of pre- to syn-metamorphic origin. However, most deposits in Hunjiang basin can be related to Mesozoic igneous activity. This includes porphyry Cu and Cu-Mo deposits as well as associated skarns and carbonate replacement deposits. Economically most significant are Au deposits hosted in Proterozoic limestone and dolomite that are located distal to the Mesozoic igneous intrusive centers. This includes the White Mountain deposit near Baishan City, which contains an endowment of more than 50 tonnes Au. There are no known high-sulfidation epithermal deposits within the Hunjiang basin, which is consistent with fluid inclusion evidence demonstrating that emplacement of the porphyry intrusions occurred at significant depth below the paleosurface. Geochronological constraints indicate that Mesozoic igneous activity and associated deposit formation in the Hunjiang basin occurred as a result of Jurassic subduction processes and subsequent extension after slab rollback and lithospheric delamination under the Eastern North China Block in the Cretaceous. Future mineral exploration efforts in the Hunjiang basin should focus on the distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits associated with Mesozoic intrusions, with special emphasis on the northern part of the basin where these deposits occur preferentially at the intersection of extensional faults with a vanished evaporite unit that is distinctly enriched in Fe oxides providing a chemical trap.\n               ","10":"\n                  The Weishan rare earth element (REE) deposit at the southeastern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) is one of the three largest carbonatite-associated REE deposits (CARDs) in China.

The laser ablation\u2013inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry (LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS) U\u2013Pb ages of zircons from the quartz syenite and postmineralization granite porphyry dyke samples of the Weishan REE deposit yield weighted mean 206Pb\/238U ages of 124.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a010, mean squared weighted deviation (MSWD)\u00a0=\u00a01.7) and 123.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a013, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.7), respectively. The quartz syenite and REE-bearing carbonatite in the Weishan REE deposit have similar Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope compositions, and their diagenetic and metallogenetic ages are the same within error, indicating that they have a very close genetic relationship and originate from identical material sources. The Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb\u2013Hf isotope compositions of both the quartz syenite and REE-bearing carbonatite are within the range of those of the Mesozoic isotopically enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath the southeastern margin of the NCC. The Weishan REE-bearing carbonatite is extremely enriched in REEs, Sr, and Ba and has a high Ba\/Th ratio. A positive correlation between the REE and Ba contents and a negative correlation between the REE content and Sr\/Ba ratio are observed in the Weishan carbonatite, indicating that the excessive enrichment of Sr, Ba, and REEs in the Weishan REE deposit might be related to the involvement of CO2-rich fluids from recycled marine sediments. Taking previous results on the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the NCC into consideration, we infer that the parent metallogenic magma of the Weishan REE deposit formed by the partial melting of the REE-refertilized and isotopically enriched SCLM, which had been previously metasomatized by melts derived from the subducted South China Block (SCB) during continental collision and by high-flux REE- and CO2-rich fluids derived from subducted marine sediments and oceanic crust during the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate.\n               ","11":"\n                  Tibet has received much attention as a pivotal area to explore the genesis of ore deposits. So far, a large number of researchers have conducted a lot of discussions on the geological conditions, genesis, distribution and scale of ore deposits in Tibet, and accumulated a plenty of isotopic test data. Isotopic data can reveal the geological changes of an area and analyze the metallogenic regularity. In this paper, combined with GIS (Geographic Information System) spatiotemporal analysis technology, Hf and Nd isotopic data mapping analysis has been carried out in Tibet. The mapping shows high zircons \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) value and high whole rock \u03b5\n                     Nd(t) value and low T\n                     DM\n                     c value on both sides of the Eastern Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone and the Western Bangong-Nujiang Suture Zone. It indicates that the terranes in these two areas are relatively young and have typical characteristics of Cu and Au mineralization, which are favorable areas for the prospecting of Cu and Au. Combined with the geological fault characteristics of Tibet Plateau, the influence of terrane boundary on the deposit and the relevant characteristics of geochemical elements, three favorable targets for Cu and Au prospecting in Tibet Plateau are delineated by GIS analysis. The results show that the characteristics of isotopic data in Tibet Plateau are quite different in disparate terranes, and the isotopic analysis can quickly delineate the strategic prospecting targets. Therefore, using GIS technology for isotope analysis and metallogenic prediction provides important guiding significance for scientific prospecting.\n               ","12":"\n                  Geothermal water from the hot springs in the Yadong-Gulu rift (YGR) of southern Tibet is extremely enriched in rare-alkali metal (RAM) elements; however, the mechanism of enrichment has long been debated. Much attention has been given to the deep melting magma of the YGR, but no direct evidence indicates whether and how it is connected to the RAM anomaly of hot springs. Determining the mechanism of RAM enrichment and its variations with the time and space of hot springs will contribute to the exploration of the hydrothermal metallogenic systems. This paper presents numerical hydrothermal numerical circulation models constrained by the geological data and the geophysical structure of the YGR. The results illustrate that the depths of boundary faults control the anomalous temperatures of hot springs. High-temperature springs (such as Yangbajing) could be induced by deep faults extending to the middle crust, whereas magma at a depth greater than 10\u00a0km has a limited effect on geothermal anomalies. Secondary faults define the extent of hydrothermal circulation and further determine the distribution of thermal anomalies across the rift. We simulate the enrichment and distribution of RAMs from a deep magma source. The pathways of RAMs from the source are consistent with hydrothermal circulation. RAM concentrations are lower in infiltrating groundwater and higher in ascending hot water. In general, deep faults control the hydrothermal circulation of geothermal groundwater. Deep faults and magma further constrain the distribution of RAM anomalies.\n               ","13":"\n                  Gasado Island, on the southwestern Korean Peninsula, comprises c. 50\u00a0Ma volcanic rocks that are cut by faults and fractures hosting low-sulfidation epithermal Au-Ag mineralization. In this study, we examined the relationship between the fault-fracture networks and auriferous vein systems to better understand the role of brittle structures in controlling hydrothermal fluid flow. Geometrical and fractal analyses were performed to express and quantitatively compare the vein geometries and thickness population. The results were as follows: (1) The geometrical analysis revealed a strong relationship between Au-Ag-bearing quartz veins and NE-SW-striking, oblique sinistral-normal faults, indicating that these structures are a key control on mineralization. (2) Box-counting fractal analysis applied to veins hosted by fault zone demonstrated that the D-values (fractal dimensions) are directly proportional to vein density \u2013 indicating that damage zones control vein density. (3) The linear traverse line analysis yielded cumulative frequency plots of vein thicknesses that showed obvious changes in the slope, which are reflected in the variable D-values. The cause of this slope variability is interpreted to be the presence of hybrid veins that fill secondary fault planes, which disturbs the original linear relationship shown by cumulative thickness distribution data. This study shows that vein density and physical properties are strongly controlled by the types, or existence, of fault damage zones. Understanding fault zone architecture may assist with the prediction of locations that concentrate mineralizing fluids and may benefit the initial stage of mineral exploration.\n               ","14":"\n                  Supergene processes related to downward water migration and dissolution of primary minerals in the New Caledonian peridotites result in Ni enrichment at the bottom of the lateritic profile near bedrock. However, the combined effects of relief, lateral fluid flow, and complex inherited discontinuity networks filled by serpentine generate a more complex Ni distribution than a simple flat horizon. In surficial environments, fluid flow and mass transfer are not limited to the vertical scale; they can also be related to lateral fluid circulation and local drainage along damage zones in the vicinity of faults. In this study, we present new structural, petrophysical and geochemical data for core samples to shed light on the impact of a fracture network on the alteration and progression of the Ni-enrichment front during weathering. The analysis of element redistribution by XRF mapping coupled with fracture extraction from computed tomography (CT) establishes that the serpentine fracture network comprises sets of sub-orthogonal fractures whose orientations are potentially determined by pre-existing magmatic foliation. The progression of the olivine dissolution front leads to the redistribution and concentration of Ni into the serpentine fracture network as secondary Mg-Ni talc-like phases. The increase in porosity from\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0% in the bedrock to\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0% in the saprock is mainly driven by the formation of nanopores. Nanoporosity may control the development of the weathering front and the redistribution of Ni by small-scale diffusion. Structural and geochemical characteristics identified at the sample scale are analogous to those observed on the larger scale of the outcrop and deposit. Scale invariance in the structural organization and geochemical evolution indicates the potential upscaling of the processes involved in the redistribution of Ni.\n               ","15":"\n                  The Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou (SYG) Pb-Zn metallogenic province located in western Yangtze Block contains more than 400 carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits.

To address this issue, the Daxiao Pb-Zn deposit was chosen as a case study. The orebodies of Daxiao deposit are hosted in Mesoproterozoic Heishan formation argillaceous dolomite interbedded with slate. Three main mineralization stages have been identified, including syn-sedimentary stage, hydrothermal stage and supergene stage. The ore minerals consist of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, argentite, smithsonite, anglesite and cerussite in the deposit. The early hydrothermal stage sphalerite yielded a Rb-Sr isochron age of 223.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma, consistent with the spike of Pb-Zn mineralization in SYG metallogenic province.

Sulfur isotopic composition (\u03b434S = +6.3 \u2013 +19.1\u00a0\u2030) of different stage sulfides reveal that the ore-forming sulfur originated from sulfates within the wall rocks, and mainly reduced by Thermal-chemical reduction (TSR).

In this study, the model averaging strategy was applied to combine the predictions of three different anomaly detectors, i.e., local singularity analysis, autoencoder network and one-class support vector machine, with the aim of accounting for this type of uncertainty. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to evaluate the model performance. A case study of processing the stream sediment geochemical samples in Northwest Sichuan Province, China was presented to illustrate the procedure. The results indicate that: (1) model averaging can further improve the predictive performance with respect to the individual anomaly detector, which hence serves as an alternative approach to account for model uncertainty; (2) geochemical anomalies patterns identified by the model averaging approaches show strong correlations with known mineralization in the study area, and those associated with low uncertainty and favorable geological evidence (e.g., fault) provide valuable information for mineral exploration at a later stage.\n               ","18":"\n                  The Banxi Sb deposit (>100,000\u00a0t Sb metal with a grade of 0.02%\u201364.5% Sb (typically 15.3%\u201325.9% Sb) in the Eastern Yangtze Block is hosted in Neoproterozoic low-grade metamorphic clastic rocks of the Banxi Group. The deposit is characterized by vein-type Sb-only mineralization. Analyses of individual quartz-hosted fluid inclusions obtained by LA-ICP-MS identified Na as the most abundant cation (thousands to tens of thousands of ppm) in the ore-forming fluids of the Banxi Sb deposit, together with variable contents of K, Ca, Al, As, Fe and Sb (tens to thousands of ppm). Multiple chemical criteria, including high Na+\/K+ (typically 3\u201315) and low Mn2+\/Na+ (0.003\u20130.2) and Sr2+\/Na+ (0.001\u20130.01) ratios of individual fluid inclusions, suggest that the fluids responsible for quartz and stibnite precipitation in the Banxi Sb deposit were likely dominated by basinal brines within low-grade metasedimentary rocks. Moreover, the extremely low 3He\/4He ratios (0.001\u20130.048Ra) but relatively high 3He\/36Ar (0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u20135.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124) and 40Ar\/36Ar ratios (323\u20131111 with an average of 737) of fluid inclusions trapped in ore-stage quartz further support a sedimentary origin of ore-forming fluids in this deposit. The positive and homogeneous sulfur isotopic values (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a08.0\u20139.5\u2030) of stibnite and arsenopyrite are comparable to those of sulfides in Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a05.6\u201311.5\u2030), indicating these metasedimentary rocks may have served as the primary source of S for the Banxi Sb deposit. Combined with geological features and new trace element chemistry data for quartz and stibnite, we envisaged a new formation model for the Banxi Sb deposit that assumes that circulation of weakly alkaline basinal brines through faults under an extensional tectonic setting during the Early Cretaceous (\u223c130\u00a0Ma), mobilization of Sb and S from the underlying and host metasedimentary rocks and ascent of ore- forming fluids along faults, and ultimately precipitation of Sb minerals in or around fault\/fracture zones as a result of the decreasing pH of the ore-forming fluids as well as sulfidation during fluid-rock reaction.\n               ","19":"\n                  The Gil\u00f3w deposit is located in the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif of the Central Sudetes (NE Bohemian Massif, SW Poland). Talcose rocks are associated with serpentinite bodies hosted by country migmatitic paragneiss, in an area where paragneiss also hosts amphibolitized eclogite bodies and granitic pegmatite veins. The talcose rocks and wall rocks were subjected to petrographic examination, electron microprobe study of minerals (including monazite Th-U-total Pb chemical dating), bulk rock chemical examination, as well as stable O, H and Cl isotope analysis. The talcose rocks can be used as a carving material and in ceramics, although the presence of tremolite and anthophyllite, and high Cr and Ni contents, preclude application in pharmacy and cosmetics. High Cr (2121.0\u20132148.4\u00a0ppm), Ni (1079\u20131561\u00a0ppm) and Co (57.4\u201384.8\u00a0ppm) contents, low \u03a3REE (2.13\u201313.81\u00a0ppm), as well as isotopic composition of O and H, classify the talcose rocks as a serpentinite-hosted type of deposit. Location in the strongly folded metamorphic unit, in the intimate vicinity of several faults and mylonitic zones, implies classification along the thrust-bound and fold-related metamorphogenic deposits. The talcose rocks are separated from serpentinites by the metasomatic chlorite schist, which contains two generations of monazite yielding two, different Th-U-total Pb dates. Older (389.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4\u00a0Ma) probably dates serpentinites juxtaposition with country paragneiss and chlorite formation. Younger (365.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2\u00a0Ma) likely dates amphiboles and talc formation, as overlaps the ages of amphibolite facies, country paragneiss migmatitization and intrusions of granitic pegmatites, and the talcose rocks contain talc-tremolite-anthophyllite assemblage indicative of the low-pressure mid-amphibolite facies. High MgO (24.27\u201327.21\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (5.06\u20135.12\u00a0wt%), Cr, Ni and Co contents are inherited from serpentinites. On the other hand, SiO2 (57.30\u201360.46\u00a0wt%), CaO (0.86\u20134.39\u00a0wt%), Al2O3 (1.38\u20133.04\u00a0wt%), TiO2 (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0wt%) and F (197\u2013337\u00a0ppm) contents in the talcose rocks are higher than in host-serpentinites, likely due to a metasomatic introduction by fluids derived from migmatitic paragneisses or intruding pegmatites. Introduction of these elements is evidenced by a negative \u03b437Cl and elevated \u03b418O of the talcose rocks relative to host-serpentinites that are typical effects of interaction with a felsic crustal material. Interaction with paragneiss- and pegmatite-derived fluids is further evidenced by REE and trace elements patterns of the talcose rocks. The LREE\/HREE enrichment, negative Sr and Ti anomalies, and positive Nb-La and Zr-Hf-Sm slopes, of the talcose rocks patterns, are similar as in paragneiss and pegmatite. Serpentinite bodies transformation into the talcose rocks was gradual and associated with increase of \u03b418O, and decrease of a Cl content, \u03b4D and \u03b437Cl. Pseudomorphic serpentinite, similar to abyssal serpentinites in terms of an isotopic composition (\u03b418O = +5.7\u2030, \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221264\u2030, \u03b437Cl = +2.0\u2030), recrystallized into non-pseudomorphic serpentinite (\u03b418O = +7.1\u2030, \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221248\u2030, \u03b437Cl\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.1\u2030), which, in turn, was replaced by the talcose rock (\u03b418O = +8.3\u2030 to\u00a0+8.7\u2030, \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221252\u2030 to \u221248\u2030, \u03b437Cl\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.6\u2030 to \u22120.1\u2030). Moreover, paragneiss- and pegmatite-derived fluids might have interacted with eclogite bodies during amphibolite facies-retrogression. Amphibolitized eclogite has Cl-rich amphibole rims, and negative \u03b437Cl (\u22120.5\u2030) consistent with a Cl-rich crustal fluid.\n               ","20":"\n                  The Jiaodong gold province hosts world-class gold deposits with giant resources of >5000\u00a0t, where the Jiaojia-Xincheng fault belt and the Sanshandao-Cangshang fault belt occupy more than two-thirds of the gold deposits. Recent developments of exploration have advanced in tracking deep mineralization. The nature of the ore-forming fluid, source, and the extreme enrichment mechanism of the gold in this region remain debated. Here, we investigate the deep ore body of the Qianchen gold deposit at the southern part of the Jiaojia gold belt based on mineralogy, fluid inclusion, elemental and isotopic composition of pyrite, and the primary halo geochemistry. Natural gold is the important form of Au in this deposit with a relatively large (up to 200\u00a0\u03bcm) grain size, suggesting the prospect of mineralization at deeper domains. The accompanying PGE minerals (Hexaferrum) hint at contributions from mantle material. The ore-forming fluids of the Qianchen gold deposit are characterized by medium\u2013low temperatures and salinities and have a general H2O\u2013NaCl\u2013CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4 composition, which indicates that the Jiaodong gold province has a unified ore-forming fluid system from shallow to deep. However, the trace elements and S isotopes of pyrite at different elevations show slight differences, suggesting the composition and properties of the fluid changed during the process of ascending, affected by ore-forming conditions such as temperature, pressure, and oxygen fugacity. Furthermore, the evidence of a decrease of salinity with depth and temperature and fluid immiscibility indicates that fluids from different sources continuously mixed during the upward migration of fluid, with the mineralization triggered possibly by phase separation. The primary halo model suggests promising prospecting potential. We formulate a comprehensive metallogenic model for the mineralization process in the Jiaodong gold province. The Au-bearing hydrous magma derived from the partial melting of the metasomatized SCLM, underwent further magmatic-hydrothermal differentiation and fluid exsolution, and thus the Au was enriched and partitioned into exsolved fluids that evolved to auriferous fluids. During the upward migration of ore-forming fluids (magmatic-hydrothermal), many factors affected mineralization, mainly including fluid-rock interaction and mixing of the metamorphic-hydrothermal and meteoric fluids. The fluid activities, multiple sources of Au in the mantle and ancient basement, together with the large fault structures resulted in the formation of the giant Jiaodong gold province.\n               ","21":"\n                  The Lishupo gold deposit is located in the central Jiangnan Orogen (South China). Gold ore occurs mainly as quartz veins and altered slates, hosted by faults and shear zones in the low-grade metamorphosed Neoproterozoic Lengjiaxi Group. Metallic minerals include pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena, and the major alteration styles include silicification, sericitization, chloritization and carbonatization. Based on its vein crosscutting relationships and mineral assemblages and paragenetic sequence, mineralization at Lishupo comprises three stages: (1) quartz (Q1)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py1)\u2013arsenopyrite; (2) quartz (Q2)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py2)\u2013polymetallic sulfides; (3) quartz (Q3)\u2013carbonate. Biotite from the sulfide-bearing ores of Stage 2 yielded a 40Ar\u201339Ar plateau age of 208.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25\u00a0Ma, and pre-ore granodiorite yielded a zircon U-Pb age of 430.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma. The dating results indicate that the Lishupo gold mineralization occurred at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0210\u00a0Ma, coeval with the Late Triassic regional gold mineralization event in NE Hunan. Stage 1 to 3 quartz has \u03b418OVSMOW = +15.5 to\u00a0+\u00a017.6\u2030 and \u03b4DVSMOW\u00a0=\u00a0\u201381.2 to \u201370.3\u2030, and the ore-fluids were calculated to have \u03b418OFluid = +2.9 to\u00a0+\u00a010.9\u2030. This suggests that the ore-forming fluids were derived from a metamorphic source with magmatic input. The auriferous sulfides (pyrite containing invisible gold) have \u03b434SCDT\u00a0=\u00a0\u201313.7 to \u20134.6\u2030, 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a018.230\u201318.642, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.615\u201315.755, and 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a038.582\u201339.100. These isotopic data indicate that the ore-forming fluids and metals were derived from a deeper metamorphic source. The Lishupo deposit exhibits many features of orogenic gold mineralization, such as control by ductile shear zones, mineralization styles (quartz veins with abundant sulfide minerals), and H\u2013O\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopic features indicating deeper metamorphic source. Based on similarities to other orogenic gold deposits, the Lishupo deposit is best classified as orogenic type formed at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0210\u00a0Ma, in response to the Late Triassic extensional tectonics caused by the Paleo-Pacific plate, or the post-orogenic tectonics after the South China-Indochina and\/or North China-South China collision.\n               ","22":"\n                  The Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh stratabound sideritic-ankeritic iron deposits are located in the Malayer-Esfahan metallogenic belt (MEMB), Iran. Geological, geochemical, fluid inclusion and S isotope studies have been carried out on the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits which are hosted by different types of Lower Cretaceous dolomite, sandstone, and tuff in the Delijan mining district (DMD). Ankerite and siderite ores display a strong lithological control and form stratabound stacked ore lenses hosted in different horizons by Kc2, Kcv, Kc3, and Km units. Economic orebodies are restricted to the hanging wall of the syn-sedimentary normal faults. Three ore types can be distinguished based on the petrographic studies: stringer zone ore facies, bedded ore facies, and massive-replacement ore facies. Ore minerals are predominantly ankerite, siderite, barite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and pyrite. Ore mineralization in the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits has emplaced in two stages. The fine-grained ore bands (stage 1) which are intricately interlayered with host rock beds, exhibit sedimentary textures such as lamina and bedding and indicate a syn-sedimentary origin. The coarser-grained stage 2 ores show massive and vein-veinlet textures that are considered to form by replacement during sub-seafloor fluid flow. Hydrothermal alteration minerals developed in the wall rock include dolomite, quartz, and calcite. A microthermometric study of fluid inclusions from the barite samples indicates homogenization temperatures between 162 and 210\u00a0\u00b0C. Salinities of ore-forming fluids range from 7.8 to 16.8\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. Fluid inclusion studies suggest that the ore-forming fluids were derived from basinal or formational brines. Fluid mixing (basinal brine and seawater) may have played an important role during Fe mineralization. Calculated \u03b434S values for the ore fluid vary between\u00a0+\u00a010.69 and\u00a0+\u00a031.98\u2030. Sulfur isotopic compositions suggest that the source of sulfur for barite was derived from seawater. These data show that the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh ankeritic-sideritic iron deposits are comparable with those of sub-seafloor carbonate-replacement SEDEX-type deposits.\n               ","23":"\n                  Pyrite (FeS2) is a common host for gold in various hydrothermal gold deposits, but the close relationship between siderite (FeCO3) and gold is rarely reported. Furthermore, the gold precipitation mechanism is also poorly understood. In the Jiudian gold deposit of the world-class Jiaodong gold province (eastern China), two gold ore stages were identified: pyrite-smoky grey quartz (the first ore stage), quartz-siderite-polymetallic sulfide (the second ore stage). Gold occurs as visible electrum with minor native gold in both ore stages. The latter stage ores have higher gold grade, indicating gold precipitation associated with second-stage siderite is more efficient than that associated with first-stage pyrite. An integration of mineral texture and composition and fluid inclusion evidence demonstrates that gold deposition in the first ore stage was formed by fluid immiscibility, which destabilized the Au (HS)2\u2212 complex in the ore-forming fluid. Fluid immiscibility (boiling) also occurred in the second ore stage, resulted from the abrupt drop of pressure and temperature due to the fracturing of the ore-controlling faults during seismic activity and mixing with cold oxidized meteoric water, and then the polymetallic sulfide precipitation was triggered. The presence of CH4 in the hydrothermal fluid of the second ore stage may have also promoted the fluid unmixing. Subsequently, the metasomatic reactions of pre-existing pyrite into marcasite and siderite occurred successively, and further facilitated with fluid immiscibility mutually by building a positive chain circuit. These complex processes may have formed a highly drastic and disequilibrated fluid system, in which the crystallized pyrite is featured by the decoupling of As and Au, which is different from the common early-ore Au-As association. The abnormal hydrothermal physicochemical perturbance may have triggered high-efficient gold precipitation associated with siderite.\n               ","24":"\n                  A 3D geological model of the Archean Esker ultramafic\u2013mafic intrusive complex of the Ring of Fire intrusive suite of northwestern Ontario (Canada) is presented, providing insight into the nature of its magmatic plumbing system and allowing for speculation on the formation of its valuable Ni-Cu-(PGE) and chromitite deposits. The 3D model was constrained by exploration drillholes and high-resolution aeromagnetic data, which allowed the interpretation of the broad internal structure of the intrusive complex and two shear zones, which define for a major part of their strike extent the contacts between ultramafic and overlying mafic intrusive rocks. Restoring the post-emplacement component of strike-slip displacement and subsequently rotating the intrusive complex back from its tilted to sub-horizontal orientation of emplacement, provides a three-dimensional rendition of a 14\u00a0km-long dominantly tabular-shaped intrusive complex. The complex is defined by intact basal intrusive contacts with localized keel-shaped ultramafic promontories parallel to a nearby blade-shaped magmatic conduit. The keels extend in a subparallel orientation to depths of up to 1\u00a0km into the underlying tonalitic rocks and coincide with significant offsets of the basal intrusive contact, leading to speculation that their intrusion may have been guided by pre-existing normal faults. Two of these magmatic conduits host Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits\/prospects that formed from gravitational segregation of sulfides. The chromitite deposits, hosted in ultramafic rocks at higher stratigraphic levels, were modeled based on drill hole assay data. Zones of dominantly massive to semi-massive chromitite were defined by the\u00a0\u2265\u00a035% Cr2O3 threshold, while intercalated sequences of chromitite in dunite\/peridotite were defined by the\u00a0\u2265\u00a015% to\u00a0\u2264\u00a035% Cr2O3 percentage range. The 3D modeled surfaces fitted to these constraints exhibit ore zones with lateral extents from several hundreds of meters for massive bodies up to a maximum of 2\u00a0km for intercalated chromitite ore that are dominantly conformable to the layering of the ultramafic host rocks. The lack of lateral continuity of chromitite ore zones beyond this scale, suggests that the chromitite layers are not continuous along the entire strike extent of the Esker intrusive complex, which is consistent with bifurcations of the 3D modeled ore shells signifying pinch-outs of both the massive chromitite layers and the dunitic interlayers. This discontinuous distribution of chromitite ore resembles that in the stratiform deposits of the Stillwater Complex and may support recent models of mechanical segregation of chromitite from cotectic chromite-olivine slurries. Based on our 3D model, we propose that the Esker intrusive complex evolved as a series of individual intrusions that were emplaced during multiple magmatic pulses that eventually coalesced to form a composite ultramafic\u2013mafic complex prior to being dissected and partly dismembered by post-ore shear zone deformation.\n               ","25":"\n                  The poorly documented Daduhe gold belt on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton, an important metallogenic belt in southwest China, is characterized by typical orogenic gold systems against a highly anomalous geodynamic setting. A synthesis of regional and deposit geology, mineralization ages, and S-O isotopic compositions of 33 gold deposits from the Danba-Kangding-Shimian-Mianning area of the belt reveals regional metallogenic patterns, establishes a consistent genetic model, and demonstrates a source equivalent to other diverse mineral systems on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton. The Daduhe orogenic gold deposits are controlled by the lithosphere-scale Xianshuihe and Anninghe strike-slip faults in the northern and southern segments of the belt, respectively. The alteration and ore mineral assemblages of the Daduhe orogenic gold deposits define a wide range of hypozonal, mesozonal, and epizonal sub-types. They formed during two episodes: 1) Early Jurassic gold mineralization related to closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, with a large hypozonal gold deposit on the margin of the Danba dome in the northern segment; 2) Cenozoic gold mineralization associated with continental collision on the Tibetan Plateau, with small mesozonal and epizonal gold deposits in shear zones in migmatite basement and at contacts with cover sequences in both the northern and southern segments. At the belt and deposit scales, the ore-controlling structures for both mineralization episodes are NNE-trending second-order extensional faults or their intersections with the dominant NW-trending compressional faults. The three deposit sub-types have overlapping \u03b434S of 0\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u2030, \u03b418Ofluid of 6\u00a0\u223c\u00a011\u2030, and low He-Ar isotope ratios, all consistent with derivation of ore fluids from metasomatized mantle lithosphere. Importantly, the Daduhe orogenic gold deposits have similar S-O-He-Ar isotope compositions to the giant IOCG, Cu-Ni-PGE, Fe-V-Ti, anomalous porphyry Cu-Mo-Au, and carbonatite-related REE deposits in the Panxi region on the shared margin of the western Yangtze Craton. This suggests that these diverse mineral systems have a common source of ore fluids and metals derived from fertile mantle lithosphere during different geodynamic and metallogenic events. Such a widespread hydrous metal-rich deep source with lithosphere-scale faults as ore fluid pathways, and a depth continuum of orogenic gold deposits in the Daduhe belt suggest a high prospectivity and a higher future gold endowment for the belt.

Most Au orebodies occur within large-scale fault zones, indicating a correlation between structural evolution and gold mineralization. Previous studies have demonstrated that Au mineralization generally developed in the Permian\u2013Triassic; however, pre-Permian gold mineralization and its temporal relationship with tectonic evolution remain poorly understood. The Qingbaishan deposit, located in the Beishan orogen, NW China, is hosted by the Sanjiashan shear zone. A detailed field-based structural analysis revealed that the Sanjiashan shear zone has thrust and sinistral strike-slip characteristics, such as asymmetrical folds and S-C fabrics. The muscovite 40Ar\/39Ar age from auriferous quartz shows that the Qingbaishan gold system formed around 399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma, consistent with the time of Sanjiashan sinistral ductile shearing in the Beishan orogen. The carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of auriferous quartz suggest that the host rocks within the Precambrian Gudongjin Group would have been a significant source of ore metals and that the low \u03b418O values in quartz resulted from fluid reactions with 18O-poor host rocks. The Qingbaishan Au deposit is concluded to be a strike-slip-dominated orogenic-type system related to continental collision between the Tarim and Kazakhstan\u2013Ili plates.\n                  By integrating the age data obtained from this study with previous geochronological results, two episodes of gold mineralization in Beishan are distinguished: an early episode around 399\u00a0Ma, when sinistral strike-slip zone-related orogenic gold deposits formed in a syncollisional setting, and a late episode around 298\u2013231\u00a0Ma, when dextral strike-slip deformation produced deposits in a postcollisional extensional setting.\n               ","27":"\n                  The Tim Merso\u00ef uranium province in northern Niger is one of the world\u2019s largest uranium reserves and fourth-highest uranium producer.

The Arlit and Akouta uranium-ores are hosted in reduced Carboniferous formations and occur as reduced U4+ phase mineralizations. Besides, the Imouraren deposit is hosted by an oxidized Jurassic formation with a predominance of U6+ silicate and vanadate minerals and relics of reduced mineralization. New U-Pb SIMS data have been obtained on the three deposits, and the results reveal two main stages of uranium deposition and ore metallogenesis. (i) the 90\u2013145\u00a0Ma Lower Cretaceous mineralization is related to a significant tectonothermal event, synchronous with the Atlantic rifting that induced the deformation and brine migration from Triassic formations. Primary uraninite and chalcocite are formed by fluid mixing in a reduced environment at that stage at a depth of 1\u00a0km at less at a temperature 115\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C, hotter than that of the reservoir. (ii) During later Cenozoic exhumation of the basin, a series of remobilizations of primary uranium stock resulted in the formation of much younger uraninites under reduced conditions at Arlit-Akouta around 50\u00a0Ma. At Imouraren, younger uraninites formed between 34 and 8\u00a0Ma under locally reduced conditions, and were followed by secondary U-minerals from 21\u00a0Ma up to 3\u20131.6\u00a0Ma during supergene events.

Sphalerite with different textures has As, Ag, Cd, Sb, and Pb contents that increase from proximal skarn to distal hydrothermal mineralization consistent with the increase in sulfosalt minerals in the late hydrothermal stage. In situ time-resolved depth profiles, together with tangential profiles, and LA-ICP-MS element mapping of sphalerite indicate that trace elements are largely in solid solution in Halasheng sphalerite with substitution mechanisms including: Zn2+ \u2194 Fe2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, and 3Zn2+\u2194 (As3+, Sb3+)\u00a0+\u00a0Ag++Pb2+.

In situ mean \u03b434S values of SpS, Sp1, and Sp2 sphalerites are 5.3\u2030, 7.6\u2030, and 8.3\u2030, respectively, indicating that sulfur was derived both from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and from wall rocks with higher (>10\u2030) values.\n                  These data help confirm that the Halasheng Ag-Pb-Zn deposit is an intrusion-related deposit with local proximal skarn mineralization at the contact of Tamulangou Formation andesite with Ergunahe Formation crystalline limestone, and more distal vein-type volcanic-hosted hydrothermal mineralization, with both ore and gangue mineral assemblages and available fluid inclusion data suggesting an intermediate-sulfidation epithermal association. As ore-forming hydrothermal fluids cooled and evolved they became enriched in silver, with silver-bearing sulfosalt minerals and silver-rich sphalerite precipitated in the latter stages of deposition.\n                  In terms of future exploration, there is potential for the concealed Lower Cretaceous Pb-Zn skarns and intermediate sulfidation Ag-Pb-Zn epithermal deposits at Halasheng to be part of a larger porphyry-related mineral system with porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposits, similar to those of Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic age in the same metallogenic belt, at deeper crustal levels than the known deposits.\n               ","29":"\n                  This study demonstrates the great value of iron oxide chemistry in low-temperature systems.

Whaleback and Mt. Tom Price are Western Australia\u2019s largest banded iron formation (BIF) hosted hematite ore deposits. The mechanisms and timing of iron enrichment from BIF (with \u223c20\u201340\u00a0wt% Fe) to high-grade iron ore (with up to 69\u00a0wt% Fe) are still controversially debated. In-situ iron oxide chemistry support post-metamorphic, structurally controlled, hydrothermal hematite ore formation via multiple stages of hydrothermally altered BIF.\n                  Iron oxides in two hydrothermal alteration zones in BIF at Mt. Tom Price (distal alteration assemblages: magnetite-siderite-stilpnomelane\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite and intermediate alteration assemblages: hematite-magnetite-ankerite-chlorite) show similar trace element patterns that are distinct from metamorphic magnetite in least-altered magnetite-quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0hematite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-silicates BIF. At Mt. Whaleback, the hydrothermal alteration is completely eradicated by subsequent microplaty-martite hematite ore formation, and solely recorded in hematite composition by the inheritance of various conservative element abundances.\n                  Petrographically indistinct zones within a given orebody are chemically distinct and demonstrate formation via contrasting structurally controlled hydrothermal fluid flow: At Mt. Whaleback, specifically in the vicinity of Central Fault and Whaleback Fault, systematic trace element group abundance trends are recorded: major controls are fO2\n                     , pH, and acquired country rock signatures, i.e., evolved (Al, Mn, Mo, Pb, U) at Central Fault, and primitive (Al, Cr, Ti, V, Cu, Ni, Co) at Whaleback fault. Complex zoned growth textures and element distribution in microplaty hematite support precipitation during protracted hydrothermal fluid\/rock interaction. In combination, our results falsify the importance of alternative hematite crystallisation models, including goethite dehydration and coalescent nanoparticles.\n               ","30":"\n                  The Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system in the southern McArthur Basin, northern Australia, played a key role in the formation of the world-class clastic-dominant (CD)-type McArthur River Zn-Pb deposit, as well as several small-sized deposits nearby in this basin. However, the spatial scale of this hydrothermal system and its role in controlling mineralisation are uncertain. Such understanding is crucial for improving mineral exploration efficiency. In this study, we characterised the geochemistry of the fine-grained (<10\u00a0\u03bcm) pyrite and the co-existing solid bitumen in the non-mineralised Paleoproterozoic Barney Creek Formation (BCF) intersected by the drill-hole Lamont Pass 3, with a novel combination of Raman spectroscopy and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (Nano-SIMS), to underpin any potential hydrothermal activities distal (\u223c50\u00a0km) to the McArthur River deposit. In the studied samples, fine-grained pyrites display sub-rounded, elongated and ultrafine-grained morphologies and occur as grain clusters spatially closely-associated with solid bitumen. Elemental maps obtained from Nano-SIMS reveal that some pyrites are enriched in trace elements, such as Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu, occurring as individual grains or overgrowth over the trace element-depleted pyrites. Fine-grained pyrites in the studied samples show similar trace element enrichment patterns to those often observed in the McArthur River deposit. The trace element-rich and -poor pyrites are interpreted to form as a result of hydrothermal and diagenetic processes, respectively. Formation temperatures of solid bitumen were estimated as\u00a0\u223c\u00a0170 \u2103 based on Raman spectral and reflectance data, approximating temperatures of hydrothermal fluids responsible for the McArthur River deposit. It is interpreted that solid bitumen may be either formed syngenetically with diagenetic pyrites and thermally reworked by hydrothermal fluids or formed contemporaneously with hydrothermal pyrite. The in-situ analysis of fine-grained pyrite and spatially-associated solid bitumen indicates that hydrothermal activity in the study area is consistent with the fluids responsible for the McArthur River deposit with respect to the trace element composition and fluid temperature. Hydrothermal fluid flow in the study area was likely a far-field effect of the McArthur River mineralisation extending along the Emu Fault. The widespread hydrothermal activity in the Barney Creek Formation strongly suggests that other factors, such as the fluid migration conduits (e.g. large-scale faults), are important controls for mineralization in this region.\n               ","31":"\n                  The Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit at Suizao (Suizhou-Zaoyang) area of Hubei province was recognized previously as an orogenic gold deposit by many researchers, in consistent with the fact that this area is dominated by extensive Early Cretaceous magmatism and associated magmatic hydrothermal deposits. In this study, we try to constrain the ore genetic type and formation mechanism of the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit by studying the source of ore-forming fluids and materials. Three paragenetic mineralization stages were recognized, including (I) feldspar-quartz-sericite-pyrite veins, (II) quartz-sulfides veins, and (III) quartz-sulfides-carbonate veins. Combined Laser Raman analysis and microthermometry for fluid inclusions hosted in quartz and calcite, the fluid system of three hydrothermal stages is all composed of H2O-NaCl\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CO2 with medium\u2013low temperatures and salinities. A gradually decreasing trend has been recorded for temperatures from 224 to 339\u00a0\u00b0C, through 182\u2013301\u00a0\u00b0C and towards 138\u2013249\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, together with salinities changing from 9.9 to 15.6\u00a0wt% NaCl eq., through 6.3\u201312.7\u00a0wt% NaCl eq., to 2.9\u20138.1\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. from early to late stages. The calculated fluid pressures range from 52 to 185\u00a0MPa at stage I, and the stages II and III vary from 42 to 128\u00a0MPa and 19 to 96\u00a0MPa, respectively. The in-situ sulfur isotope data suggest that the sulfur sources were dominantly mixture of magma and surrounding metamorphic rocks, and the C\u2013H-O isotope data imply the mineralizing fluids were originated dominantly from magmatic fluid and mixed with some meteoric water. By means of comparison with regional magmatism and mineralization ages, we consider that the fluids may have originated from the buried granite that also supplied some sulfur and particularly heat energy to drive the fluid circulation system to extract metallogenic materials (Au and other elements) also from country rocks, resulting in mineralization after fluid flow into the fractures and faults of the metamorphic rock strata. In consequence, we draw a conclusion that the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit pertains to hydrothermal quartz vein-type deposit controlled by both of magmatic fluid and structure.\n               ","32":"\n                  The source of metals involved in the formation of oceanic ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal Cu-Fe-Co-Zn-Ni mineralization remains poorly constrained. Here, we focus on a fossil ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal mineralized system preserved in the Platta nappe (SE Switzerland), where mantle rocks were exhumed along detachment faults to the seafloor during Jurassic rifting. The Cu-Fe-Co-Zn-Ni mineralization, associated with Fe-Ca-metasomatism (ilvaite-hydroandradite-diopside), represents an analogue of the root zone of present-day hydrothermal systems formed at mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Rainbow hydrothermal field at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge). We apply the Sr isotope geochemistry to Fe-Ca silicates and secondary, alteration products that include serpentinites, altered mafic and carbonated rocks to constrain the source(s) of metals and to characterize the plumbing system. The Fe-Ca silicates and carbonates have Sr isotope ratios close to that of Jurassic seawater, suggesting a near seafloor, seawater-dominated hydrothermal system with high fluid\/rock ratios. The altered mafic rocks have 87Sr\/86Sr ratios lower than those of Jurassic seawater. In contrast, serpentinites display a large range of Sr isotope ratios, including values higher than those of Jurassic seawater, indicating long lived fluid\/rock interactions and multi-stage fluid infiltrations. These results suggest that hydrothermal activity started during final crustal thinning, when seawater percolated along normal faults through the hyper-thinned crust, acquiring high Sr isotope ratios before penetrating and initiating serpentinization of the subcontinental mantle rocks. At this early stage, the system was rock-dominated (i.e., low fluid\/rock ratios), leading to high 87Sr\/86Sr ratios in serpentinites. On their way-back to seafloor, the uprising, serpentinization-derived fluids mixed with seawater resulting in the precipitation of metal sulfides and Fe-Ca silicates, with subsequent carbonation in a fluid-dominated system. Our study shows that the Sr isotope geochemistry can be used to identify reservoirs involved in the formation of mineral deposits and for the characterization of the plumbing system of oceanic ultramafic-hosted mineralizations.\n               ","33":"\n                  Phase separation is a crucial controlling factor of gold deposition in shallow and low-medium temperature orogenic gold systems in the Jiaodong gold province. In this study, spatial distributions by three-dimensional (3D) modeling and correlation analysis of Au, S, Cl, Hg, Fe2O3, Cu, Pb, and Bi were conducted to demonstrate the occurrence of phase separation and its significance in geochemical exploration. The modeling and analysis were based on a geochemical dataset of 1130 borehole samples from the Qujia gold deposit. The ore bodies developed in deep traps (e.g., fault intersections and dilational cracks). Gold and S are positively correlated and mainly distributed along the Jiaojia Fault (JJF). Scatter plots show little correlation between Au and Cl. However, the Au and Cl distributions presented by the ore-bearing boreholes and 3D modeling suggest that Cl escaped from the ore-forming fluid and formed enrichment zones above the ore bodies during the Au mineralization which is consistent with the salinity decrease from the early and main ore-forming stage to the late ore-forming stage of many gold deposits in the JJF and other areas of the Jiaodong gold province. The spatial distribution of Au and Hg are indicative and compelling although they have little correlation in the scatter analysis. Mercury depletion zones and subsequent funnel-like Hg anomalies are present above the ore bodies and strong Hg anomalies appear in the deep traps. The results suggest that phase separation is responsible for Au precipitation in the Qujia gold deposit. Mercury, Cl, and Pb partitioned into a gas phase forming medium-to-high anomalies along the secondary faults whereas Au, S, Fe2O3, Cu, and Bi partitioned into a liquid phase forming ore bodies and medium-to-high anomalies along the JJF during the phase separation. Specifically, the pH increase induced by the partition of CO2, HCl and minor amounts of H2S into the gas phase, and S consumption by the abundant metals (Fe2O3, Cu, Bi, etc.) in the ore-forming fluid, rather than H2S escape, are the dominant factors governing Au precipitation. Finally, potential indicators of geochemical exploration are proposed including composite anomalies of Au and Hg in the near surface medium, high Hg anomaly accompanied by no or low Au anomaly in the fault zones, and extremely high Cl or S anomalies in deep depths. Given the similarity of the ore-forming fluid and metallogenic mechanism at the shallow depths, these indicators are potentially useful for Au exploration in the Jiaodong gold province.\n               ","34":"\n                  Mineralization age dating is essential for understanding orogenic-type gold metallogeny, but suitable minerals for dating are not always available. Apatite can incorporate considerable amount of U and Th, making it a potential U-Pb geochronometer to study hydrothermal alteration and mineralization processes. The newly-discovered Nianzha is a large orogenic Au deposit (\u223c25\u00a0t @ 3.08\u00a0g\/t Au) and located in the contact fault zone between ultramafic rocks and diorite in the Renbu tectonic m\u00e9lange of southern Tibet. Two different types of apatite were identified in the Nianzha gold deposit: type I magmatic apatite hosted in diorite and syenite, and intergrown with other magmatic minerals; type II hydrothermal apatite hosted in mineralized diorite. These apatite grains are coarse euhedral granular and closely associated with auriferous sulfides (e.g., pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena). Type I apatite is F- and SO3-rich, whereas type II apatite is distinct from type I apatite by its significantly higher Cl, Mn, rare earth elements (REE), U, Th, and As contents, indicative of a hydrothermal origin. Thus, formation age of type II apatite reflects the timing of gold mineralization. Two type I magmatic apatite samples yielded similar discordia U-Pb ages of 80.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.56\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.3; n\u00a0=\u00a086) and 79.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.91; n\u00a0=\u00a072), respectively, whilst type II hydrothermal apatite yielded a discordia age of 44.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.45\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.2; n\u00a0=\u00a064). The gold mineralization age is consistent with that of nearby orogenic gold deposits (e.g., Mayum, Bangbu, Zhemulang, and Juqu) in the region. Therefore, we suggest that hydrothermal apatite U-Pb dating can effectively constrain the timing of orogenic Au mineralization events.\n               ","35":"\n                  The North Narbaghi Cu-Ag deposit in the central part of the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc (UDMA) of Iran is hosted by Eocene volcanic sequences and Oligo-Miocene intrusions of arc affiliation. The mineralization can be divided into five stages that are represented by barren hydrothermal breccias, Cu-Fe sulfides cementing in the breccias, sulfosalt and sulfide hydrothermal breccias, barren post-ore quartz veinlets, and barren post-ore calcite veinlets, respectively. The metallic minerals consist of pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, sphalerite, and tennantite-tetrahedrite, which are variably associated with gangue minerals including quartz, calcite, and sericite. The upper parts of the ores have been oxidized to form supergene minerals including malachite, azurite, chrysocolla, chalcocite, covellite, hematite, and goethite. The ore-related hydrothermal alteration includes silicification, pyritization, carbonatization, intermediate argillitization, and propylitic alteration. Primary fluid inclusion assemblages in quartz associated with main-stage sulfides and sulfosalts have homogenization temperatures ranging from 184\u00b0 to 385\u00a0\u00b0C and calculated salinities between 12.0 and 29.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. (avg. 21.4\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv.). The coexistence of fluid inclusion assemblages with highly variable volume percentages of vapor phase indicates that boiling commonly occurred in the hydrothermal system, contributing to Cu saturation. Sulfide minerals range in \u03b434S from \u22121.5 to 3.7 \u2030, indicating a probable magmatic sulfur source. This view is further supported by the carbon and oxygen isotopes of hydrothermal carbonates, with \u03b413CPDB of \u22122.2 to \u22121.5 \u2030 and \u03b418OSMOW between 5.30 and 11.75 \u2030. Stable isotope and fluid inclusion data illustrate that boiling of the ore fluid and its mixing with meteoric water facilitated mineralization at the North Narbaghi. We suggest that the North Narbaghi Cu-Ag deposit can be best interpreted as an intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit formed due to post-Eocene magmatic-hydrothermal activity. The intersections of post-Eocene subvolcanic rocks with regional faults were the most favorable sites for focusing fluids responsible for epithermal mineralization along the UDMA.\n               ","36":"\n                  The Num\u00e3o gold deposit in the northern part of the Iberian Variscan belt is close to the regional first-order Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas fault system. The second and third-order structures controlled the gold mineralized bodies. These bodies consist of disseminated sulfides, arsenopyrite-quartz veins, and sulfides-scheelite-quartz veins. The scheelite occurrence predates the gold mineral assemblage and is lithologically controlled by host rocks with calc-silicate minerals. The ore mineral assemblage comprises scheelite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, bismuth, and Au-Ag mineral phases, with minor pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, and galena. The hypogene gold minerals at Num\u00e3o deposit are hosted by arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, and silicate matrix in minor amounts. Chemically, gold fineness ranges from 663 to 841. The thermal evolution of the mineralization was estimated based on arsenopyrite (381\u00b0 to 502\u00a0\u00b0C) and chlorite geothermometers (264\u00b0 to 341\u00a0\u00b0C). The multi-element and principal component analysis information was used to better identify geochemical patterns and trends in hydrothermal alteration.

This paper aims to present a holistic model that describes the focussing of a regional-scale fluid flow into narrower, mineralized structures during the late-stage refolding and tightening of the first-order folds that host the mineralization.\n                  The auriferous reefs of the SFC are hosted by well-bedded, low-grade metamorphic, clastic sedimentary rocks of the Paleoarchaean Fig Tree and Moodies groups that are preserved in two regional-scale, strongly curved and refolded synclinal structures along the northern margin of the belt. The majority (85 %) of presently and historically mined orebodies occur in the broad hinge zone of the refolded synclines. This suggests the regional-scale fluid redistribution from fold limbs into the first-order fold hinge following regional hydraulic gradients during refolding. Ubiquitous bedding-parallel quartz (-carbonate-sulphide) veins and associated alteration underline the significance of bedding anisotropies and bedding-parallel flexural slip for regional-scale fluid flow during refolding. The focussing of these fluids and economic-grade gold mineralization occurs preferentially along contacts between lithologies with pronounced rheological contrasts. Lithological contacts combine the effects of strain localization in weaker units and the formation of fracture permeabilities in competent units across these contacts. Examples include kilometer-scale hinge-parallel ore shoots that are controlled by undulations (jogs) along low-displacement slip horizons between retrogressed ultramafic rocks and competent metasediments. In contrast, low-angle thrusts or steep reverse faults form accommodation structures related to the late-stage tightening of the first-order folds. These structures transect bedding at high angles and are, thus, ideally orientated to collect fluid from the regional system of bedding-parallel fluid flow.\n                  Mineralization in the SFC may be explained by the spatial and temporal coincidence of (1) late-stage NW-SE shortening and refolding, of (2) a well-bedded, anisotropic wall-rock sequence, associated with (3) regional-scale fluid redistribution along bedding planes during flexural slip, leading to (4) fluid focussing into either jog geometries or bedding discordant structures. The combination of these factors is unique to the SFC and accounts for the location of the main Barberton gold mines along the northwestern margin of the greenstone belt.\n               ","38":"\n                  The Early Cretaceous Duolong porphyry-epithermal copper ore district is one of the largest copper ore districts in the central Tibetan Plateau. In order to investigate the preservation mechanism of Early Cretaceous porphyry-epithermal mineralization, new apatite and zircon fission track dating and (U-Th)\/He dating of pre-ore sandstone, ore-related and barren intrusive rocks, and post-ore igneous rock, thermal modeling together with previous thermochronological data of the Duolong ore district were combined to study the burial and exhumation processes. Apatite fission track ages range from 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma, with mean track lengths varying from 12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0 to 12.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0\u03bcm. Zircon fission track ages range from 106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma. In addition, apatite (U-Th)\/He yields average age ranging from 62.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2 to 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, and zircon (U-Th)\/He yields average age of 112.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1\u00a0Ma. The thermal modeling shows that the Duolong ore district experienced two periods of exhumation and two stages of burial. The first period of exhumation with rate of 0.14\u00a0km\/m.y. took place immediately after the ore formation which caused the erosion of orebody. Two periods of burial are thought to be related to northeast-southwest striking fault and thrust nappe structure induced by Lhasa-Qiangtang collision between 110 and 65\u00a0Ma when the overlying rocks of orebodies were thickened to 4\u00a0km. The last period of exhumation with rate of 0.062\u00a0km\/m.y. (since 65\u00a0Ma) is attributed to lithospheric delamination related to India-Asia collision. The preservation of the Duolong ore district mainly benefited from the burial related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. The exhumation and uplift of Duolong ore district was mainly attributed to the India-Asia collision since Paleocene.\n               ","39":"\n                  The Kupferschiefer deposit in SW Poland provides an opportunity to study an ore system where besides factors such as temperature, salinity and pH, redox conditions play a major role in controlling trace element incorporation in sulphides. Chalcocite, djurleite, bornite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, covellite and pyrite from the Cu-Ag deposit in the Lubin-Sieroszowice district were analysed with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to study the distribution of trace elements and to identify the main carriers of by-products such as silver and rhenium. Trace element anomalies are not only associated with certain minerals but also linked to specific mineralization styles. Chalcopyrite in epigenetic veins has significantly higher content of Ge, As and Sb while sulphides adjacent to hematitic \u201cred spots\u201d are enriched in redox sensitive elements: djurleite is enriched in V, Se, Re, Au, Hg and Tl, chalcopyrite in V, Se, Hg and Tl, and pyrite in Tl in comparison with bulk Cu-Ag mineralization. Elevated and substantially more variable data for V, Mn, Ni, Co, Ga, Mo, Sn in shale hosted sulphides can be attributed to submicron inclusions of Kupferschiefer silicate matrix which might skew low concentration values even if careful petrographic observations and precise spot selection are applied. Silver concentrations form a linear pattern from chalcocite\/djurleite\u00a0>\u00a0bornite\u00a0>\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0>\u00a0sphalerite. Silver distribution in the deposit on a broad scale could be linked to the general Fe3+-Cu-Pb-Zn-Fe2+ zonation as well as mineral sequence (hematite-chalcocite-bornite-chalcopyrite-galena-sphalerite-pyrite) observed in the majority of sediment hosted stratiform copper deposits. Epigenetic sulphide-calcite veins associated with local faults and tectonic zones contain chalcopyrite exceptionally rich in germanium (up to 4806\u00a0\u03bcg\/g of Ge) suggesting that the potential of Kupferschiefer Cu-Ag ores in terms of Ge grades and resources could be underestimated. The majority of analysed sulphides do not contain rhenium above detection limits (0.1\u00a0\u03bcg\/g Re) with measurable quantities found almost exclusively in djurleite (up to 3.9\u00a0\u03bcg\/g Re).

The deposit occurs adjacent to the Varmarziar quartz monzonite, quartz monzodiorite, and monzosyenite intrusions. Ore mineralization consists of three stages; (i) an early stage dominated by gold-bearing breccia veins mainly consisting of quartz, pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, minor magnetite and bornite assemblages, (ii) a main stage, which is divided in three sub-stages I, II and III. Sub-stage I is dominated by Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag-rich mineral assemblages including galena, Fe-poor sphalerite, minor chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, and pyrite. Sub-stage II is only represented by galena and Fe-poor sphalerite. Sub-stage III is defined by Fe-Mn-Zn-Ca-Mg carbonate minerals. The late supergene stage (iii) is characterized by malachite, covellite, chalcocite, cerussite, and Fe-oxide and hydroxides. Microthermometry of primary fluid inclusion assemblages indicate homogenization temperatures (Th) of 253\u00b0 to 305\u00a0\u00b0C and salinities of 3.5\u20134.82\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent in the early stage. The main stage indicates homogenization temperatures (Th) of 200\u00b0 to 280\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00b0 to 235\u00a0\u00b0C with salinities of 2.18\u20134.96 and 0.53\u20132.90\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent for the sub-stages I and II, respectively.

This approach identified three geochemical data associations (F1, F2, and F3) which were then used to calculate the values of the geochemical prospectivity index (GPMI). The results indicated that the large GMPI Cu values correlate strongly with the surface indices.

The first stage, spanning from the late Mesozoic to early Paleocene, is characterized by significant N-S crustal shortening associated with the Cordilleran-type orogeny along the Gangdese arc. The region's Paleozoic-Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks were penetratively strained. Locally deformation was largely partitioned along the LMF. During the second stage (ca. 66\u201355\u00a0Ma), the area was affected by extensive multi-stage Linzizong volcanism, including caldera formation, as well as a coaxial N-S propagative deformation with a distinctive lower shortening rate. We recognized two types of mineralization, both were formed during the second stage. The first type of mineralization (orebody III) is governed by fractures within the extensively deformed Paleozoic carbonate rocks at the LMF's footwall. The overlying LVS, however, includes discrete but numerous mineralized sections. The terminal splays of the ore shoots typify the products of hydraulic fracturing. We propose that the propagative compressive deformation drained fluid reservoirs at depth to higher levels via the \u201cFault valve\u201d effect. Episodic fluid influxes and mineral deposition formed the time-integrated mineralization. The second type of mineralization (orebody I) is hosted in the LVS in a number of breccia pipes and dykes that were controlled by the structural weaknesses generated by the intersection of the radial and ring fractures. Mineralization occurs as veinlets in the matrix and clasts inside the breccias, which are characterized by multi-stage brittle cracking, fluid injection and mineral precipitation. It is interpreted that the multi-stage magmatism (ca. 66\u201355\u00a0Ma) triggered repeated hydrothermal activities and incremental mineralization within the ore-bearing breccia bodies.\n               ","43":"\n                  The Bou Azzer district in Morocco has a long mining history since the beginning of the XXst century during which it has become the only world producer of Co from primary, hydrothermal Co arsenide ores. Orebodies are structurally controlled, and mainly distributed along fault contacts between Cryogenian ophiolite-related serpentinite bodies and intrusive quartz diorite or, locally, ophiolitic gabbros or Ediacaran volcanic rocks. Ore formation took place through a multi-stage mineralizing process that included an early stage composed by gold, quartz, chlorite, muscovite and calcite, followed by the main arsenide and sulfarsenide stage (subdivided into three substages, IIa: Ni-rich, Co ores, IIb: Co-Fe ores and IIc: Fe-Co ores), and ending with an epithermal stage characterized by the precipitation of sulfides along with quartz and calcite. Field relations and most previous geochronologic dating pointed to a post Pan-African age of ore formation, mainly coincident with the Hercynian orogeny.\n                  The isotopic study presented in this paper includes S, Pb, Rb\/Sr and Sm\/Nd data of a set of ore mineral samples from three deposits (Aghbar, Tamdrost and A\u00eft Ahmane), as well as of regional samples representative of the different lithologies occurring in the Bou Azzer area. The isotope data set was completed with S isotope analyses of arsenide and sulfarsenide minerals from five ore deposits (Filon 7\/5, Aghbar, Tamdrost, Ightem and A\u00eft-Ahmane) and of some whole-rock regional samples. Results show that ores formed during multi-episodic hydrothermal events connected with hercynian reactivation of Devonian-Carboniferous faults, supporting previous geochronologic dating. The obtained Pb, Sr, Nd and S isotopic signatures of ore minerals and regional rocks further show that ophiolite-related lithologies became isotopically modified by interaction with crustal material and afterwards acted as the main source of ore-forming elements. Nevertheless, isotopic data do not fully concur with such a simple scenario but are quite consistent with a rather complex interpretation based on multi-source origin of some elements and isotopes scavenged from a number of isotopically different lithologies both from the inferred basement and the volcanic and sedimentary cover.\n               ","44":"\n                  The Escoural gold district belongs to the Montemor-Ficalho metallogenic belt which is part of the Portuguese section of Ossa-Morena Zone (OMZ), at the SW of Iberia. The Escoural gold district includes twelve gold prospects and\/or deposits largely controlled by the NW-SE Montemor-o-Novo Shear Zone (MNSZ) and associated fault zones, extending for approximately 30\u00a0km. Ubiquitously, gold-arsenopyrite-loellingite assemblages hosted in quartz-sericite-chlorite veins are found in most deposits, although, in the Monfurado prospect, the gold-bearing assemblages are more complex. This prospect is located in the vicinity of a Cambrian SEDEX-VMS iron deposit, from which massive and disseminated iron-ores hosted in marbles and calcsilicate rocks, were exploited. The interplay of the gold mineralizing processes with the iron-rich host rocks has favored gold deposition at the Monfurado prospect. Selected samples from six drill cores allowed to define two mineralizing events: the pre-ore and ore stages. Two types of gold mineralization characterize the ore-stage: i) massive sulfide horizons in which gold (Au\u00a0=\u00a085.6\u201386.3\u00a0wt%; Ag\u00a0=\u00a013.1\u201313.6\u00a0wt%) is hosted in arsenopyrite and pyrite or, seldomly, gold particles (Au\u00a0=\u00a091.8\u00a0wt%; Ag\u00a0=\u00a07.1\u00a0wt%) found in an arsenopyrite-rich layer; and ii) quartz-chlorite-pyrite veins crosscutting acid metavolcanic rocks with rhyolite-rhyodacite affinities, in which gold (Au\u00a0=\u00a080.5\u201382.9\u00a0wt%; Ag\u00a0=\u00a016.8\u201318.7\u00a0wt%) is found as fracture filling in pyrite, sometimes accompanied by Bi-Te phases. Arsenopyrite geothermometer suggests that for type i the overall deposition temperature falls within the range of 188\u00a0\u00b0C to 372\u00a0\u00b0C. Type ii mineralization lacks arsenopyrite, and for this reason, thermodynamic constraints were gathered from fluid inclusions and chlorite geothermometer. CH4-rich fluid inclusions are ubiquitous in transgranular fluid inclusion planes, suggesting that reduced fluids percolated the rocks that host type ii mineralization. The reduced fluids support the transport of gold in sulfide complexes, such as AuHS- and Au(HS)-\n                     2. Furthermore, secondary H2O-NaCl fluid inclusions (Lw2) were found, with mean salinities of 6.0\u00a0eq. w(NaCl) and mean homogenization temperature of 226\u00a0\u00b0C, with corresponding pressures of 3.0\u00a0MPa, thus suggesting late hydrostatic regimes. Chlorite geothermometer results are in the range of 229\u00a0\u00b0C and 309\u00a0\u00b0C, agreeing with the fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures for Lw2 fluids.\n                  Sulfur isotope (\u03b434S) analysis of representative sulfide phases collected from both mineralization types, revealed signatures ranging from 8.5 \u2030 and 10.6 \u2030, indicating a single sulfur source. The gathered results suggest that although fluid transport is structurally controlled by MNSZ activity, the sulfidation reactions promoted by fluid-rock interactions are the main control on gold deposition from type i mineralization. It is further suggested that a coeval gold-event can lead to the deposition of two different types of mineralization, related to distinct gold deposition mechanisms.\n                  The tectonic and geodynamic settings in which the Escoural gold district developed correlate it to worldwide Palaeozoic orogenic gold deposits, with the Monfurado prospect being an example of the complexity of such geological settings.\n               ","45":"\n                  The Oligo-Miocene Etili epithermal deposits are a well-preserved fossil geothermal system in the \u00c7anakkale Region and is one of the largest fossil siliceous hot spring deposits of Turkey. Main E-W and NE-SW trending faults systems occur with minor NW-SE fracture systems perpendicular to the main faults. Silica-rich deposits are commonly observed in or on the calc-alkaline tuffs, ashes and pyroclastic rocks that were the products of the magmatism controlled by the extensional tectonic regime.\n                  The Etili epithermal system was examined at two representative locations including the Hamamtepe and Muratlar sites. Morphologies of the proximal apron were defined by lithofacies that included silica infiltrate, spring conduits, nodular and finely laminated geyserite, sinter clast breccia, silicified volcanic rocks, and epithermal veins. Microfossils were detected in mat structures developed in the proximal apron. The silica deposits have low abundances of altered mineral assemblages (e.g., kaolinite, halloysite, and alunite), which are otherwise commonly observed in the region. The origin of the Etili Fossil Silica Sinter Region (EFSSR) was constrained by using geochemical and isotopic data. \u03b418O and \u03b4D isotopic values of kaolinites ranged +9.4\/+9.6 \u2030; to 84\/\u221274 \u2030 respectively. \u03b418O isotopic values from siliceous and silicified samples ranged from 8.3 to 18.4 \u2030, which shows two different formation types for the Etili Fossil Silica Sinter Region. We hypothesized hypogene origins for the kaolins and a mixed hypo\/supergene origin for siliceous and silicified samples. The calculated model formation temperature from the \u03b418O values of the silica and siliceous samples is in the range of 63\u00b0 to 140\u00a0\u00b0C. \u03b434S isotopic values of alunite ranged from \u221219.6 to +16.6 \u2030, which also indicated two different sources that include magmatic hydrothermal and meteoric waters affected by bacterial activity. The timing of acid-sulphate alteration can be grouped into three periods by 40Ar\/39Ar dating of alunites. These ages are: (A) 32.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0Ma in the Muratlar silica site, (B) 12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 to 15.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma in the northern part of the Hamamtepe site and (C) 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 to 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma in the southern part of the Hamamtepe silica site. These consistent findings show that the emplacement periods of the Evciler pluton and the ages of alteration deposits are similar to each other. Silica sinters and geyser mounds represent very late stage near-neutral pH alkali chloride geothermal activities. The epithermal deposits in the EFSSR comprises a complex history of three different hydrothermal processes, each of which have different compositional and temporal emplacement periods related to the Evciler pluton.\n               ","46":"\n                  The Linxi fluorite district is located in the southern Great Xing\u2019an Range and tectonically belongs to the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Previous studies mainly focus on the metal deposits in this region, but relatively little attention has been paid to the fluorite mineralization. The Linxi district contains more than 60 fluorite deposits while the formation age, nature of mineralized fluids, and ore-forming processes are poorly understood. This study focuses on geology, geochronology and geochemistry of the fluorite deposits in the Linxi district which share similar and relatable geological features. Fluorite veins are strictly controlled by \u223cS-N-, NNE-SSW- and NE-SW-striking fault zones. Ore mineral assemblages are quite simple and mainly include fluorite, quartz and calcite. Geochronological data indicate that the main-stage fluorite vein mineralization in the Linxi district occurred approximately at 137\u2013132\u00a0Ma. Fluid inclusions hosted in fluorite, quartz and calcite mainly homogenize at 140\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to low salinities (mainly 0.3\u20131.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent). Ore-forming fluids are characterized by low temperatures, low salinities and low densities of the H2O\u2013NaCl system. The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of samples obtained from the Linxi fluorite district indicate an origin of meteoric water. Combined with trace element geochemistry, fluorite, quartz and calcite in this area share a common hydrothermal origin. The large-scale fluorite mineralization in this region may link to the Late Mesozoic metal metallogenic events in the southern Great Xing\u2019an Range associated with the extensional tectonic setting.\n               ","47":"\n                  Wulong goldfield (WLGF) is situated in the Liaodong Peninsula, northeast of the North China Craton (NCC). During the Mesozoic, the eastern NCC was tectonically reworked, with the stress state to change from compression to extension, accompanied by a large amount of magmatism and extensive gold mineralization. To reveal the relationships among the intermediate to felsic plutons, fault structures, and gold mineralization in the WLGF, we deployed a short-period dense array (WSP array) consisting of 334 portable seismometers. We then processed the ambient noise data to extract a total of 45,531 group velocity dispersion curves with periods of 0.3 to 2.0\u00a0s. We adopted a direct inversion method to invert these dispersion curves to construct a 3D ambient noise tomography model of shear-wave velocity structures. The 3D model generated allows us to draw the following conclusions: (1) The model shows prominent NNE- and NW- trending low-velocity anomalies that are interpreted to be caused by the intense hydrothermal alteration related to the gold mineralization along some NNE- and NW-trending faults; (2) The distribution of seismic velocity in the Early Cretaceous Sanguliu pluton in the southern WLGF is not homogeneous on account of its lithological variation, whereby compositional zoning is characterized by monzogranite in the centre and granodiorite in the margin; (3) The concealed NW-trending fault has a larger downward extension (>1.4\u00a0km) than that of the NNE-trending faults (\u223c1.0\u00a0km), indicating the NW-trending faults played an ore-conducting role and the NNE-trending ones are likely the structures of ore-distributing and\/or ore-hosting for the Wulong gold metallogenic system; (4) We suggest three favourable potential areas for future exploration, all of which are located at and around the intersections of the NNE- and NW-trending faults and are close to the known (or concealed) Early Cretaceous granite intrusions; (5) Our results demonstrate that ambient noise tomography based on the short-period dense seismic array is effective in determining metallogenic structures at orefield scale and has significant potential application in mineral exploration.\n               ","48":"\n                  The Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits are located in the Shiyaogou ore field within the Xiong'ershan area, East Qinling, China, where the ore bodies are hosted in Xiong'er Group and mainly controlled by EW-trending and NE-trending faults. The gold mineralization mechanism and the possible genetic link with the porphyry magmatism and hydrothermal events remain unclear. Here we present results from systematic field investigation, petrographic observation, in situ trace elements and sulfur isotope of pyrite to elucidate the genesis of gold mineralization in these deposits. Based on the occurrences of pyrite in different hydrothermal veins, three types of pyrite are identified from each deposit, including: i) coarse-grained cubic pyrite (HZ-Py1 and YL-Py1) in stage I milky quartz vein; ii) medium- to fine-grained pyrite (HZ-Py2 and YL-Py2) in stage II polymetallic sulfides veins; iii) coarse-grained pyrite (HZ-Py3 and YL-Py3) symbiotic with calcite in stage III quartz-calcite vein. The LA-ICP-MS trace element analyses of pyrite show that Au occurs as invisible nanoparticles or nano-sized inclusions in pyrite through absorption-chemisorption during the growth of pyrite or as nano-sized Au-bearing mineral inclusions. The \u03b434S values of different generations of pyrite in the Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits range from 3.92\u2030 to 6.43\u2030 and 2.82\u2030 to 4.46\u2030, respectively, indicating that the ore-forming materials were mainly derived from mantle-related source with affinity to the Late Mesozoic granitic magmatism. The Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits are spatially and temporally correlated with the Shiyaogou pluton and they show consistent material sources. We propose that the hydrothermal Au mineralization in these deposits were the distal products generated from the post-magmatic fluids of the Shiyaogou porphyry system. The stretching and thinning of the early Cretaceous lithosphere led to the upwelling of magma and migration of fluid, forming the Au mineralization in fault structures in the shallow crust.\n               ","49":"\n                  This paper investigates the origin of the newly discovered Devonian carbonate-hosted Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit in South China. This deposit is rich in Ge (>900\u00a0t @ 110\u00a0ppm Ge) and contains 7.7\u00a0Mt of sulfide ores at a mean grade of 5.1\u00a0wt% Zn. The mineralization is stratabound or veined and is structurally controlled by the E-W trending Huangsi fault. Sulfide ores are dominated by sphalerite and dolomite with subsidiary pyrite, marcasite, and calcite, and minor galena. The mineralization forms massive, veined, brecciated, and disseminated structures and the hydrothermal minerals present in the deposit have colloform, fibrous, granular, and acicular textures. The hydrothermal dolomite has positive Ce (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a01.13\u20131.20) and negative Eu (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.43\u20130.68) anomalies that are indicative of formation in a weakly acidic, reduced, and low-temperature environment. The \u03b413CPDB and \u03b418OSMOW values of the dolomite range from \u22120.97\u2030 to \u22120.24\u2030 and +13.89\u2030 to +21.84\u2030, respectively, indicating that the dissolution of carbonate wall rocks was involved in the formation of hydrothermal dolomite. Theoretical C-O isotopic calculations further suggest that the hydrothermal dolomite formed as a result of water\/rock (W\/R) interaction and CO2 degassing. The \u03b434S values of the sulfides (\u221211.23\u2030 to \u22124.95\u2030) are markedly lower than those of the Devonian seawater sulfate and sulfate from evaporates in the Devonian strata (+21.9\u2030 to +25.9\u2030), suggesting that the reduced sulfur was derived from evaporates within the ore-hosting sedimentary rocks by bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). The Banbianjie sulfides have an upper crustal Pb isotopic affinity, as demonstrated by their 206Pb\/204Pb (18.335\u201318.343), 207Pb\/204Pb (15.725\u201315.735), and 208Pb\/204Pb (38.288\u201338.326) ratios, suggesting the metals were derived from metamorphosed basement rocks. These data suggest that: i) the Banbianjie deposit formed as a result of a combination of weakly acidic, reduced, and epigenetic low temperature mineralized fluids, trap structures, and favorable lithologies; ii) W\/R interaction and CO2 degassing caused the precipitation of hydrothermal dolomite, whereas mixing of metals and S2\u2212 was the main formation mechanism of the sulfides; and iii) the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit is a typical Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit.\n               ","50":"\n                  The giant Sb metallogenic belt in South China (GSMB) has been proved to provide approximately half the world\u2019s reserves and Sb production. This metallogenic belt is tectonically located along the transition zone between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, covering an area of\u00a0\u223c\u00a01900\u00a0km long and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0200\u00a0km wide, with a set of large or giant Sb deposits such as the Xikuangshan, Banxi, Woxi, Qinglong, and Banpo-Banian. The Sb deposits have the following features in common: localisation in sedimentary rocks or counterpart metamorphic rocks as veins or strata, structural-tectonic control of mineralisation along the regional NE-trending faults, and the presence of intermediate-mafic dyke rocks in the belt whose relationship with Sb mineralisation is not obvious. Fluid inclusion data show that the Sb mineralisation in this belt generally occurred under low-temperature and low-salinity conditions (140\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.2%\u201310% NaClequiv.). Abundant isotope data suggest that the Sb deposits in this belt were dominantly generated by crustal fluids from the Proterozoic basement sequences and fresh meteoric water or their mixture with various proportions, whereas the magmatic contribution to Sb mineralisation in this region is a preferential heat source rather than a material supplier (i.e., fluids and metals). The reported geochronological data of representative Sb deposits suggest an age distribution trend of Sb mineralisation, from 120 to 130\u00a0Ma in the Xikuangshan, Banxi, Woxi, Banpo and Banian Sb deposits in the northern and central parts of the GSMB, to 140\u2013165\u00a0Ma in the Qinglong, Muli and Maxiong Sb deposits in the southern part of this belt. This age trend of the GSMB is largely comparable to that of Mesozoic igneous rocks in the Cathaysia Block, indicating both of them are the products of the west-northwestward flat-slab subduction and post-subduction of the paleo-Pacific Plate during the Late Mesozoic. In combination of the geological, geochemical, and reported geochronological data, we proposed that the Sb deposits in GSMB in South China probably have been mainly generated by low-temperature and low-salinity crustal fluids which leached Sb and S from basement sequences under an extensional setting during Late Mesozoic.\n               ","51":"\n                  The Southeast Missouri Iron Metallogenic Province in the Midcontinent USA contains seven major and several minor IOA\/IOCG-type deposits and a series of shallow vein-type deposits\/prospects, all of which are spatially and temporally associated with early Mesoproterozoic (1500\u20131440\u00a0Ma) magmatism in the St. Francois Mountains terrane. One of the vein-type deposits is the Shepherd Mountain deposit, which consists of two northeast-trending ore veins dominated by magnetite and lesser amounts of hematite. Here we report the findings of a study that investigates the origin of the Shepherd Mountain deposit and a possible genetic link to the nearby (i.e., <5 km away) magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal Pilot Knob ore system that comprises the massive-to-disseminated Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit and the overlying bedded and brecciated Pilot Knob Hematite deposit.\n                  Petrographic observations, whole-rock data and the trace element and Fe isotope composition of magnetite and hematite show that the Shepherd Mountain deposit formed from at least five pulses of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids with different compositions and physicochemical parameters. Integration of the data for the Shepherd Mountain deposit with new and published data from the Pilot Knob Magnetite and Pilot Knob Hematite deposits shows that the three deposits are genetically linked through two local faults. The Ironton and Pilot Knob faults provided fluid pathways that connected the Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit to the shallower Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob Hematite deposits. Consequently, we argue that the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob Hematite deposits are near-surface extensions of the same magmatic to hydrothermal plumbing system that formed the Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit at depth.\n               ","52":"\n                  The Bigorne deposit is classified as an orogenic gold system that comprises gold-bearing veins cutting through the synorogenic Variscan granites in the northern Iberia. The mineralized structures are subparallel of the regional Penacova-R\u00e9gua-Ver\u00edn strike-slip fault system. The mineralized bodies include quartz-sulfide veins, disseminated sulfides with pervasive hydrothermal alteration, and oxidize fractures. The thermal evolution of the mineralization was estimated based on i) mineralogical and thermodynamic stabilities of Au-Bi-Te-(S) phases and ii) arsenopyrite geothermometer. The temperature ranges from 455\u00b0 to 354\u00b0C for arsenopyrite precipitation. For Au-Bi-Te-(S) mineral phases was possible to define a range of deposition temperatures from 371\u00b0C to 235\u00b0C. The main gold deposition episode is inferred to be the last at lower temperatures. In order to constrain the origin of gold-bearing fluids and metals in the Bigorne deposit, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotope studies were undertaken. \u03b418O from quartz in veins shows a narrow range of +13.0 to +13.3\u2030. \u03b4D from quartz ranges between \u221262.5 and \u221264.7\u2030. \u03b434S in arsenopyrite clustered around \u22122.8\u2030. These stable isotope data, interpreted in the context of the regional and local geology and the estimated timing of mineralization, suggest that the sulfur- and gold-bearing fluid was generated from deep-crustal rocks during decompression triggered by crustal uplift, late in the orogenic evolution of the area.\n               ","53":"\n                  The Klamath Mountains gold province is the second most important historical producer in California, having produced more than 7 Moz of gold from both lode and placer sources. Hydrothermal muscovite grains from gold-bearing veins provide the first 40Ar\/39Ar age constraints indicative of a protracted period of mineralization in the Klamath Mountains. The data indicate that the window for orogenic gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains was from\u00a0~\u00a0160\u2013140\u00a0Ma, coinciding in age with the oldest orogenic gold deposits in the Sierra Nevada foothills province to the south, although mineralization continued in the latter along the Mother Lode belt for another 20\u201330 million years. Despite the broad age overlap between hydrothermal activity and magmatism, the former relates to a regional thermal event, and there is no genetic link between the two. Instead, a correlation exists between the timing of lode gold formation and discrete tectonic events, changes in stress regime, and fault movement. The maximum age corresponds to a major plate reorganization in the Pacific basin and initial gold mineralization continuing into the Sierra Nevada foothills gold province to the south. The minimum age corresponds to the westerly lateral offset of the Klamath Mountains from the Sierra Nevada and the then-active arc, marking the termination of both magmatism and gold-producing hydrothermal activity in the Klamath Mountains. Lode gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains is compatible with a crustal source of metals and fluids that were released during metamorphic devolatilization and focused via hydrothermal fluid flow along regional faults.\n               ","54":"\n                  As a result of the continued depletion of shallow ore resources, there has been renewed focus on the tectonic preservation of mineralized systems. Specifically, it is vital to constrain the post-mineralization exhumation and preservation history of existing economic deposits, in order to identify new regions suitable for mineral exploration. In this study, we present results from apatite U-Pb, fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)\/He thermochronological and associated thermal history modeling studies on the Yumugou Mo-W deposit within the world-class East Qinling Mo polymetallic metallogenic belt, central China. Our major aim is to constrain the exhumation history and to evaluate preservation potential of the Yumugou Mo-W deposit, and provide related guidance for mineral exploration in the East Qinling Orogen. Apatite U-Pb dating yield Early Cretaceous lower intercept Terra-Wasserburg ages in the range of 153\u2013141\u00a0Ma, interpreted as crystallization age of apatite, coeval with the formation of Yumugou deposit (ca. 145\u00a0Ma). Integrated apatite fission-track and apatite (U-Th-Sm)\/He dating give ages varying from Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene, representing the post-mineralization cooling ages. We also integrate these age data with confined fission-track length measurements and geological constraints from previous studies into the thermal history models, the resulting models suggest three cooling pulses: 1) a phase of Early Cretaceous (125\u2013100\u00a0Ma) rapid cooling, followed by 2) a phase of Late Cretaceous (100\u201373\u00a0Ma) slow cooling, before finally, 3) a phase of Late Cretaceous to Paleogene (73\u201350\u00a0Ma) rapid cooling. The Early Cretaceous rapid cooling pulse correlates temporally with extension tectonic setting in the East Qinling Orogen, the magma emplacement and post-magmatic rapid cooling at ca. 160\u2013130\u00a0Ma in the Luanchuan region might cause related exhumation at ca. 125\u2013100\u00a0Ma to upper crustal temperatures. The Late Cretaceous slow cooling possibly corresponds to regionally slow extensive erosion in response to crustal shortening triggered by the westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate at this time. The Late Cretaceous-Paleogene rapid cooling likely result from the major far-field effects of the Pacific Plate subduction and the sinistral strike-slip motion of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone, as well as possible minor expansion effects derived by the Paleogene India-Eurasia collision. Moreover, we adopt thermal history modeling method to determine cooling rate, exhumation rate and depth of different cooling stages. In comparison with the calculated exhumation depth (\u223c5.6\u00a0km) and previously reported metallogenic depth (3\u20137\u00a0km) in the Luanchuan ore cluster, we infer that more than one kilometer metallogenic depth is theoretically preserved in the Yumugou Mo-W deposit. Combined the similar metallogenic setting and features with other giant Mo deposits in the East Qinling Orogen, we further suggest that the Mo deposits in this orogen possibly have underwent a similar degree of exhumation and show good prospecting potential.\n               ","55":"\n                  The Proterozoic Vazante-Paracatu mineral belt hosts distinct styles of mineralization in carbonate rocks, including world-class hypogene silicate-zinc deposits in the south and sulfide Zn-Pb deposits in the north. This study focuses on the Morro Agudo District (Morro Agudo deposit and Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences). The genesis of the Morro Agudo sulfide deposit is controversial (i.e., syn-diagenetic or syn-orogenic), and little was known about the other occurrences. Ore is stratigraphically controlled within distinct dolomitic units of the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio and Lapa formations and structurally controlled at the Morro Agudo deposit along a NW normal fault system. Mineralization is characterized by multiple generations of sphalerite and galena, coeval with hydrothermal Fe-rich dolomite, pyrite, and quartz, which overprint micritic and sparitic dolomite and diagenetic pyrite. The mineralized zones comprises Cd and Hg within the high-grade Zn-Pb ore and Ag, As, Cu, Fe, In, Se, Sb, and Tl extending into the hydrothermal halos surrounding the orebodies. The sphalerite compositions encompass variable proportions of Zn (58.75\u201366.92\u00a0wt%), Fe (0.15\u20135.03\u00a0wt%), and Cd (0.18\u20130.94\u00a0wt%) grouped in five populations based on Cd-Fe ratios and principal component analysis. Sphalerite from various generations and locations in the orebodies and occurrences do not show any specific signature, suggesting episodic contribution of multiple fluids with distinct Fe and Cd contents. The whole rock lithogeochemistry revealed similar trace element signatures for the orebodies of Morro Agudo deposit and surrounding occurrences indicating, despite the textural differences, that these orebodies formed from similar mineralizing fluids and processes, except for the Bento Carmelo occurrence. This study shows clear evidence that the mineralization at the Morro Agudo deposit, Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences is epigenetic, forming after the diagenesis of the host carbonate succession, and may have involved progressive mixing of multiple fluids with distinct compositions that interacted with sulfur reservoirs in the dolomitic rocks, similar to other MVT districts worldwide. The Morro Agudo district is one of the rare examples of Proterozoic MVT districts, and this study brings new insights to the exploration of this type of mineralization in similar basins.\n               ","56":"\n                  The Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas deposit, located in northern Chile, represents a unique opportunity to constrain unusual geological processes involved in the genesis of sapphire-rich metasomatites in the central Andes. For this purpose, geological mapping was combined with conventional and high-resolution petrographic and mineralogical analysis (light microscope, SEM-EDS and automated mineralogy). Results demonstrate that this uncommon occurrence is genetically related to eight main lithological units that host variable proportions of corundum (sapphire), sillimanite, andalusite, diaspore, b\u00f6hmite, dravite, magnesiofoitite, olenite, alunite, and calcite. Microtextural relationships between mineralogical assemblages demonstrate that the origin of this deposit was associated with two main genetic stages. The early stage is linked to the initial crystallisation of abundant sapphire, promoted by an extreme desilication during high-temperature prograde metasomatic processes due to the intrusion of a Cretaceous granodioritic magma body (Si-Al-rich) into basaltic rocks from the La Negra Formation (Al-rich Si-poor) through the Atacama Fault System. The late-stage corresponds to hydrothermal alteration of sapphires to b\u00f6hmite and diaspore in the deep and shallow zones, respectively, where dravite and alunite were precipitated directly from these fluids. The formation of this late hydrothermal assemblage can be interpreted as an overprinting of a metasomatic retrograde system. This study demonstrates that the sapphire-bearing rocks at Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas correspond to primary metasomatic sapphirites related to middle- to high-temperature contact metasomatism at estimated pressures of\u00a0\u223c\u00a02 kbar.\n               ","57":"\n                  Delineation of geochemical anomalies is a fundamental task in mineral and environmental investigation. Mineralization area of interest is mainly controlled by underlying geological environment. These geological constraints facilitate to identify mineralization anomalies and remove pseudo-anomalies. Regional geochemical data is one of most commonly used in deriving mineralization information, which is also considered to be the primary data for direct geochemical anomaly identification. The selected study area, Jining in central Inner Mongolia of China, is mostly covered with Quaternary sediments, whereas is located in the important molybdenum polymetallic mineralized belt. The overburden shields the geochemical signatures from deep, resulting in missing some important information. The NE-trending faults, intersection of faults, Jining formation and mid-acid granites is mainly ore-forming factors in this study area, which are used as the geological constraints for identifying molybdenum polymetallic mineralization. Geographical weighted regression (GWR) generates the mean and variance of probability soft data based on these geological constraints. Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) integrates the constructed soft data with geochemical data for obtaining practical mineralization anomalies. These results shown that the combination of BME and GWR can identify local anomalies and weak anomalies compared with the results obtained from geochemical data alone. Specially, some anomalies of different periods of deposits have been highlighted in the results of BME-GWR model. The discovered deposits correspond tothe identified mineralization anomalies well. The BME-GWR model provides a potentially powerful tool for geochemical anomaly identification under consideration of geological constraints.\n               ","58":"\n                  The newly discovered Pengyang uranium prospect area in the southwest of the Ordos Basin is the world's first uranium deposit hosted in eolian sandstone, which overturned the conventional view of uranium mineralization in fluvial-delta sedimentary strata. Uranium ore body occurring as tabular or lens-shaped is hosted in the gray-green reductive eolian sandstone of Lower Cretaceous Luohe Formation at depths ranging from 700\u202fm to 3000\u202fm. The host eolian sandstone is characterized by the typical high angle cross-bedding, wind sand ripple and grainflow strata. In this study, we conducted borehole log, petrographic observation, whole rock geochemistry analysis, geochemical and mineralogical study of uranium occurrence (SEM), element mapping of uranium minerals and in-situ sulfur isotope determination of pyrite by LA-MC-ICP-MS to reveal the uranium enrichment mechanism. The observations by SEM show that the predominant uranium mineral is pitchblende, primarily occurring as aggregates of nano to micro crystals absorbed on amorphous TiO2 or as colloform replacing the detritus Fe-Ti oxide minerals, both demonstrating the excellent absorption property of small particles of anatase. The contents of altered minerals such as chlorite and pyrite in gray-green sandstone increased significantly under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Whole rock geochemistry analysis data of sandstone samples collected in the target layers display the strong positive correlation between U and S. Whereas, in the elements mapping images, uranium enrichments display complete dissociation with pyrite as the uranium contents adjacent to or around the pyrite grains are under detection limit, demonstrating that uranium precipitation likely occurred earlier than the sulfuration of red eolian sandstone. Sulfur isotope of the two morphological types of pyrite are both characterized by a relatively light signature, ranging from\u202f\u2212\u202f19.23 to\u202f\u2212\u202f27.22 \u2030 and from\u202f\u2212\u202f21.60 to\u202f\u2212\u202f29.64\u2030 respectively, implying that they are generated from bacterial sulfate reduction in the open systems with an adequate supply of sulfate. Anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria use the hydrocarbon transferred along faults to the sandstone as energy to reduce sulfate (SO4\n                     2\u2212) to H2S. In addition to the typical vertical red - yellow - gray color zonation, we also observed distinct reverse color zonation of sandstone, which can hardly be interpreted by traditional interlayer-oxidation-zone theory. We attribute the uranium reduction to the encounter of downward penetrating oxygenated groundwater with the upward migrating oil and gas conducted by thrust faults, which are widespread distributed in the west margin of the Ordos Basin. This study gives a new insight into uranium metallogenic mechanism in eolian sandstone and underpins an effective vector for the exploration of sandstone-type uranium deposits in the western of the Ordos Basin.\n               ","59":"\n                  The Habo Au polymetallic deposit is located in the south of the Ailaoshan-Red River tectonic zone. Mineralization is controlled by a strike-slip fault, which was intruded by aplite. Ore minerals are dominated by pyrite and arsenopyrite. Gold is invisibly and ionically bound in pyrite and arsenopyrite. Three hydrothermal alteration-mineralization stages can be identified: quartz-pyrite (py1)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite vein associated with sericite alteration (I), quartz-pyrite (py2)-polysulfide (II) and quartz-calcite (III). The aplite yielded zircon U\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Pb ages of ca. 35.4\u00a0Ma while the sericite in pyritized siltstone yielded an Ar-Ar age of ca. 37.5\u00a0Ma, constraining the mineralizing age. In situ S\u2013Pb isotopic compositions for sulfides were measured by fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS. Sulfides from the deposit show uniform \u03b434S values ranging from \u20135.1\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a02.5\u2030, a typical characteristic of magmatic-derived S. Pb isotopic compositions of galena are similar to those of the granite in the Habo granite complex, suggesting that the metal is probably sourced from the Habo granite complex. In-situ LA-ICP-MS spot analysis indicates that py1 has high Ni, Co, As and Se concentrations while py2 contains higher concentrations of Au, As, Cu, Pb and Zn. These characters reveal that the ore-forming fluids are As-rich and largely unsaturated with respect to Au. Based on the ore deposit geology, dating and isotopic data, the Habo Au polymetallic deposit mineralization is similar to typical intrusion-related vein-type deposit, formed by fluids originated from magma differentiations of the Habo granite complex.\n               ","60":"\n                  We present the seismic and 3-D gravity study to define the ore-controlling structures of sandstone-hosted uranium deposits in the southwestern Ordos Basin, the second largest sedimentary basin in China. The instantaneous amplitude and frequency are extracted from seismic reflection data, and the seismic impedance is obtained by joint inversion of well-log and post-stack seismic data. Results of the seismic attributes and inversion show that the uranium-bearing deposits exhibit low instantaneous frequencies, low instantaneous amplitudes and medium\u2013low seismic impedances. The scratch analysis method is employed on the residual gravity anomaly generated from the gravity bouguer anomaly by using the potential field separation. The edge coefficient image of the residual gravity anomaly shows that the fault structures are composed of NE-trending faults in the west and EW-trending faults in the east of the study area. The 3-D gravity inversion constrained by the seismic data was performed to reveal that uranium-bearing deposits are characterized by low gravity anomaly, which is related to the larger porosity of the uranium-bearing sandstones. Geophysical results show that the uranium-bearing deposits are controlled by flower structures, EW-trending normal faults and NW-trending thrust faults. Flower structures are produced by the tectonic inversion as a result of the uplift and NE-directed growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Ore-controlling faults cut crossing the floor of the ore-bearing strata as channels, along which the ore-forming fluids move upward and are enriched in the sandstone strata with high permeability and porosity in Luohe Formation. In addition, the roof and floor of the ore-bearing strata in Luohe Formation are characterized by high impedance and gravity anomaly, which has a sealing effect on uranium deposits. Then we predicted the thickness of the sandstones in Luohe Formation, as the sandstone is a prerequisite for mineralization.\n               ","61":"\n                  Orogenic-type deposits are widely developed in the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ) of Iran, but few studies were done on the gold metallogeny in the southern SSZ. Here, we conducted fluid inclusion (FI) studies on the auriferous quartz veins from the Zartorosht deposit, in order to unravel the ore-fluid nature and key controls on ore element transport and deposition. Vein-type gold mineralization at Zartorosht is hosted along E-W-trending normal faults in greenschist-facies metamorphic rocks. Fluid inclusion analysis of the main-ore stage quartz suggests that the ore-forming fluids belong to the H2O-NaCl-CO2 system, with homogenization temperatures of 230\u2013290\u00a0\u00b0C and salinities of 3\u20137\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv., resembling that of typical orogenic gold deposits. The ore-forming fluids display a mixed metamorphic-mantle source based on multi-isotope evidence: 1) the ore-fluid \u03b4DV-SMOW (\u221269.8 to \u221245.1\u2030), \u03b418OH2O-SMOW (2.3\u20136.0\u2030), and \u03b413CV-PDB (\u221221.1 to \u22126.2\u2030) values are similar to mantle-derived fluids; 2) the ore-fluids have high 3He\/4He (2.51\u20138.00 Ra) and 40Ar\/36Ar (296\u2013389) values, suggesting that mantle-derived gases were trapped inside the FIs; 3) calculation suggests that mantle-derived helium in the FIs accounts for (average) 8.34% of the total helium. Consequently, we propose that the Zartorosht gold mineralization is of orogenic-type. The decreasing pressure trend from early- to late-ore stage and the microfracture-filling gold occurrence suggest that temperature and pressure drop is the key trigger for gold deposition. Integrated with previous studies, we demonstrate that the ore-forming fluids were likely produced during the Cenozoic extension and post-peak metamorphism of the Zagros orogeny. Crustal-scale ductile shearing may have allowed the mantle-derived fluids to ascend into their secondary brittle structures, where the ores were precipitated in fracture-filling auriferous sulfide-quartz veins, forming the Zartorosht Au deposit.\n               ","62":"\n                  The early Neoproterozoic Shilu iron deposit is located in Hainan Island, South China. It is an unusual Fe deposit with high-grade (average FeO of 51\u00a0wt%) and giant scale (proven Fe-ore reserves\u00a0>\u00a0500 Mt). It is one of a few examples of banded iron formation (BIF) type deposits formed in the interval between 1.8 and 0.8\u00a0Ga, thus providing an opportunity to understand the source of the iron and the metallogenic processes involved. Based on Fe content and modal composition, three types of ores are recognized from the Shilu iron deposit, comprising quartz itabirites, amphibole itabirites, and ferruginous sandstones. Except for the ferruginous sandstone, a detrital component is also present in quartz and amphibole itabirites as indicated by the positive correlation between TiO2 and Al2O3 and the negative correlations of TiO2 and Al2O3 with Y\/Ho ratio. Ti and Al are immobile elements during weathering and hydrothermal alteration processes and so they retain a constant ratio in terrigenous materials, and they have lower Y\/Ho ratios than sea water. The detrital component is consistent with a generally flat pattern of Post-Archean Australian shale normalized REE plus Y (REYPAAS). A large contribution of seawater is rejected because of the absence of Ce and Y anomalies and significant left-sloped REYPAAS. Due to the lack of a stable Eu positive anomaly or elevated Ho\/Lu ratio, the contribution of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids is ruled out. A large amount of barite occurs in the Shilu deposit, which is a signal of low-temperature hydrothermal processes. The subdued positive Eu anomalies displayed by some quartz and amphibole itabirites from the Shilu deposit arise from the presence of barite as indicated by a strong positive correlation between \u03b4Eu and Ba. Fe isotope ratio data show a notable fractionation in the sequence of iron-bearing rocks as shown by a systematic increase in \u03b457Fe (\u22121.14 to 2.41\u2030) from the base to the top. The fractionation trend is in agreement with a stratified ocean where the water is increasingly oxidized towards the surface. A metallogenic model is proposed where the Shilu BIFs are deposited from low-temperature Fe-bearing hydrothermal fluids vented into a redox-stratified shallow-water basin on a passive continental margin where extensional faults possibly acted as fluid paths. The depositional environment is similar to Superior-type BIFs, but the iron source here is related to a proximal hydrothermal vent system.\n               ","63":"\n                  The Tara Deep Zn-Pb deposit, at Navan, Ireland, includes sub-economic pyrite-rich mineralization extending laterally for about 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0km within the overlying Lower Vis\u00e9an calc-turbidites, known as the \u2018New-Thin Bedded Unit\u2019. Here, we investigate the genesis of this pyritic mineralization and its links to the limestone-hosted Zn-Pb deposit lying 100\u00a0m below it.\n                  Four mineral assemblages have been identified: 1) in black shales, laminated pyrite comprises thin framboid-rich layers with minor interstitial sphalerite, both showing variable but low \u03b434S values ranging from \u221237.4 to 3.3\u2030; 2) in calcarenite and calcsiltite layers, pyritized fossils are widely distributed and occur chiefly as biodebris replaced by low \u03b434S pyrite (mean values of \u221213.2\u2030); 3) a replacive assemblage occurs as late remobilizations exhibiting both crosscutting and bedding-parallel styles, overprinting the early laminated pyrite. It comprises mostly of marcasite, with minor pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, stibnite and Co-pentlandite, with high \u03b434S values up to 24.5\u2030; and 4) in black shales, bedded sulfide-rich cherts comprising microcrystalline quartz lenses exhibit \u03b418O mean values of 25.3\u2030. Cherts are rimmed by dolomite, associated with marcasite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, siegenite and stibnite also with high \u03b434S values up to 44.2\u2030. In general terms, pyrite shows a relatively high Co\/Ni ratio\u00a0>\u00a01 and sphalerite Zn\/Cd ratios vary from 268 to 364.\n                  Textural analysis indicates overlapping of early-diagenetic and multi-phase hydrothermal sulfide mineralization. Development of laminated pyrite and pyritized calcarenites suggests that this mineralization was generated during early diagenesis, close to the seawater-sediment interface in oxygen-poor conditions under the influence of low-temperature hydrothermal fluid circulation. Later hydrothermal cherts and replacive sulfides suggest discharge of relatively warm hydrothermal fluids during early to mid-diagenesis, presumed to be linked to movements of nearby normal faults. Similarities in mineralogy and S isotope compositions suggest genetic links between the sub-economic pyritic mineralization and the underlying Tara Deep deposit, and consequently, that the former represents a geochemical halo with direct applicability in exploration for Zn-Pb deposits.\n               ","64":"\n                  The recently explored inactive Tianzuo hydrothermal field, in the amagmatic segment of the ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), is closely associated with detachment faults. In this site, sulfide minerals are hosted by serpentine-bearing ultramafic rocks and include high-temperature (isocubanite, sphalerite, and minor pyrrhotite) and low-temperature (pyrite I, marcasite, pyrite II, and covellite) phases. In this study, trace-element concentrations of isocubanite and pyrite II were used to elucidate mineralization processes in ultramafic rocks hosting sulfides. Results show that isocubanite is enriched in metals such as Cu, Co, Sn, Te, Zn, Se, Pb, Bi, Cd, Ag, In, and Mn, and pyrite II is enriched in Mo and Tl. The marked enrichment in Te, Cu, Co, and In in isocubanite (compared with Se, Zn, Ni, and Sn, respectively) is most likely due to the contribution of magmatic fluids from gabbroic intrusions beneath the hydrothermal field. The intrusion of gabbroic magmas would have enhanced serpentinization reactions and provided a relatively oxidizing environment through the dissolution of anhydrite precipitated previously in the reaction zone, within high temperature and low pH conditions. This might have facilitated the extraction of metals by initial hydrothermal fluids, leading to the general enrichment of most metals in isocubanite. Metals in pyrite II have compositions similar to those of isocubanite, except for strong depletion in magmatically derived Te, Cu, Co, and In. This means that serpentinization processes had a dominating role in pyrite II precipitation as well. The enrichment of pyrite II in Mo and Tl is also indicative of seawater contribution in its composition. The study concludes that serpentinization reactions contribute effectively both to high- and low-temperature sulfide mineralization at Tianzuo hydrothermal field, with gabbroic intrusions further promoting high-temperature sulfide mineralization, providing additional metals, fluids and heat. In contrast, low-temperature sulfide mineralization occurred during the cooling of gabbroic intrusions, with decreasing rates of serpentinization reactions and a significant influence of seawater.\n               ","65":"\n                  The large Erdaohe Pb-Zn-Ag deposit is an important and representative skarn deposit in the middle segment of the Great Hinggan Range. The Pb-Zn ore bodies are mainly hosted in and among different lithological layers of volcaniclastic and carbonate rocks. The Si\u2013Ca interface with abrupt changes in rock chemical properties and the bedding detachment faults played important roles in controlling mineralization. The mineralization of the deposit can be divided into three stages: (1) pre-ore skarn stage (I); (2) syn-ore quartz\u2013sulfide stage (II); and (3) post-ore quartz\u2013carbonate stage (III). Here, we present a combined study of geology, fluid inclusions (FIs), laser Raman analysis and H\u2013O\u2013S isotopes to constrain the origin and evolution of ore-forming fluids and the source of ore-forming materials. Four types of FIs are identified in the Erdaohe deposit, including liquid-rich (L-type), vapor-rich (V-type), CO2 (C-type) and daughter mineral-bearing (S-type) FIs. The L-type, V-type, C-type and S-type FIs appear simultaneously in stages I and II, and their homogenization temperatures (Th) are similar, indicating that boiling of the ore-forming fluids occurred. From stages I to III, Th varies from 338 to 475\u00a0\u00b0C, 194 to 383\u00a0\u00b0C and 157 to 323\u00a0\u00b0C, with salinities ranging from 3.87 to 50.72\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv., 0.35 to 39.05\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. and 0.18 to 6.88\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv., respectively. The main ore-forming fluid was a H2O\u2013NaCl\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CO2 system. From stages I to III, the variations in \u03b418Ofluid range from \u22122.3 to 7.2\u2030, \u22128.8 to 1.0\u2030, and \u221213.6 to \u22123.8\u2030; the ranges of \u03b4D are \u2212141 to \u2212208\u2030, \u2212133 to \u2212161\u2030, and \u2212126 to \u2212142\u2030, respectively. H\u2013O isotope studies reveal that the initial ore-forming fluid was mainly derived from magma and underwent intense degassing, followed by mixing with meteoric water. The \u03b434S values of sulfide minerals vary in a small range, are concentrated from 5.2 to 10.0\u2030, and are characteristic of deep-sourced magmatic sulfur. The high \u03b434S values in the Erdaohe deposit are probably the result of magmatic sulfur mixing with sulfur from the surrounding Duobaoshan Formation. The alteration style related to mineralization, combined with FIs, laser Raman analysis, and H\u2013O\u2013S isotopes, suggests that the Erdaohe Pb-Zn deposit is a typical skarn deposit associated with magmatic activity. The boiling of ore-forming fluids and mixing with meteoric water played crucial roles in ore precipitation.\n               ","66":"\n                  The Pefka Cu-Au-Te-In-Se and nearby St Philippos Pb-Zn-Bi-Sn-Ge-Ga-In vein- and breccia-type deposits in western Thrace, Greece, display strong similarities, but also differences in terms of mineralization style, ore mineralogy, and chemistry, and host rock compositions. The Pefka mineralization consists of two crosscutting vein systems with high sulfidation (HS)- and intermediate-sulfidation (IS) assemblages hosted by andesitic lavas and is unusually enriched in In (up to 700\u00a0ppm), Te (>1000\u00a0ppm), Se (>100\u00a0ppm), and Cu (>1\u00a0wt%). The main In-carriers are roquesite (CuInS2) and In-bearing \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d and Cu-rich \u201ctennantite-(In)\u201d which contains up to 6.5\u00a0wt% In, substituting into the C site. Roquesite is associated with enargite and arsenosulvanite\/colusite, as part of the HS assemblage at Pefka. Selenium-bearing galena and a large suite of tellurides including calaverite, sylvanite, petzite, hessite, kostovite, empressite, tellurantimony, and coloradoite, in addition to native tellurium, account for the marked tellurium and selenium enrichment in the ores from Pefka. Tellurides and native gold at Pefka accompany the precipitation of Te-bearing minerals of the tetrahedrite group, such as \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d and \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d, and Cu-excess varieties of tetrahedrite and tennantite. However, the bulk of telluride deposition is associated with normal, fully substituted tetrahedrite-tennantite varieties.\n                  The St Philippos deposit is associated with a brecciated fault zone hosted by Eocene sandstones and Oligocene quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes. It is enriched in a large suite of incompatible elements, including Bi (>2000\u00a0ppm), Sn (>100\u00a0ppm), U (up to 200\u00a0ppm), Pb (>1\u00a0wt%), Zn (>1\u00a0wt%), Mo (up to 62\u00a0ppm), Ge (>100\u00a0ppm), Ga (up to 466\u00a0ppm) and In (up to 222\u00a0ppm), contrasting with the element suite defining the nearby Pefka deposit. The main carrier of In, Ga, and Ge is sphalerite (and wurtzite) with In-rich zones in sphalerite containing up to 6.1. wt% In. Germanium and Ga in sphalerite reach concentrations of up to 0.27 and 0.32\u00a0wt%, respectively. Sphalerite from the St Philippos deposit is extremely Fe-poor (<0.04\u00a0wt%), and is associated with an unusual suite of Sn-bearing sulfosalts (k\u00ebsterite-stannite, Mn-bearing k\u00ebsterite, unnamed Cu2MnSnS4), and enargite, marking an early HS event. K\u00ebsterite also hosts indium (up to 0.6\u00a0wt% In). Mn-bearing varieties of tennantite host inclusions of minor tellurides (e.g., hessite, altaite, and tsumoite) and formed later in the paragenetic sequence under transitional HS-IS and IS conditions.\n                  Both deposits are characterized by early high-temperature (>300\u00a0\u00b0C) and HS fluid conditions, followed by IS assemblages as temperatures waned. Rhyolitic oxidized magmas are considered to be the sources of metals in the St Philippos deposit; however, their anomalous W, Sn, U, and Bi contents suggest a contamination by crustal rocks. The Cu-Au-Te signature of the Pefka deposit is compatible with a genetic relationship to less fractionated andesitic magmas, although a possible contribution of In from rhyolitic magmas could explain the high In contents of the ore. However, other factors, as for example different metal-deposition mechanisms resulting in metal zonation around causative porphyry centers at depth, may also account for the observed metal endowment in these two deposits. The Sn-Te-In-(Ge-Ga) element association at Pefka and St Philippos is unusual in that it has been previously reported from only a few other places in the world (e.g., Capillitas deposit, Argentina, and the Kawazu deposit, Japan). We conclude based on this exotic mineralization-style that the northeastern part of Greece represents an area of great potential for the exploitation of critical metals and metalloids.\n               ","67":"\n                  The Keyue Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag deposit is a medium-sized deposit near the super-large Zhaxikang Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag deposit within the North Himalayan Metallogenic Belt (NHMB). These two deposits, separated only by a regional NS-trending normal fault with strike-slip properties, have similar ore-forming elements and mineral associations, ore characteristics, ore paragenetic sequence, wall rocks, and H\u2013O\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopic and fluid inclusion characteristics. Herein, we establish Zn\u2013Cd isotopic connections between these two proximal ore deposits. As a means to draw comparisons, we conducted Zn\u2013Cd isotopic research of the Keyue deposit to compare it with that of the Zhaxikang deposit. Both the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n                     114\/110Cd values of sphalerite from the Keyue deposit display a temporally decreasing trend from stage 2 (\u03b466Zn: 0.15\u2030\u20130.58\u2030, average value\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u2030; \u03b4\n                     114\/110Cd: \u20130.23\u2030 to 0.38\u2030, average value\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u2030) to stage 3 (\u03b466Zn: \u20130.28\u2030 to 0.12\u2030, average value\u00a0=\u00a0\u20130.06\u2030; \u03b4\n                     114\/110Cd: \u20130.38\u2030 to \u20130.32\u2030, average value\u00a0=\u00a0\u20130.35\u2030), which was also found in the Zhaxikang deposit. A simple three-phase separation distillation models this temporally decreasing trend, which resulted from the Zn\u2013Cd isotopic fractionation that is most likely related to vapor\u2013liquid-solid dynamics of ore-forming fluid. This distillation model was further augmented by the general geochemical characteristics and fluid inclusion data. A congruence among several geological and geochemical evidence points to the genetic relationships between these two ore deposits that have the same metal origins and experience similar ore formation processes. A three-phase separation model has been established to imitate this evolution, which reveals substantial exploration potential for Zn\u2013Cd at depths below 4100\u00a0m within the Zhaxikang orefield. In summary, Zn\u2013Cd isotopes have the potential to trace metal sources, monitor fluid evolution, constrain ore formation, and provide insights into mineral exploration.\n               ","68":"\n                  Recognition of the sources of metals and fluids is crucial to determine the genesis of gold deposits, especially in distinguishing the orogenic and magmatic hydrothermal deposits. There is no consensus on the source and genetic style of the Mesozoic gold deposits in the North China Craton (NCC). The Taijiying gold deposit in the Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district on the northern margin of the NCC is a medium-sized gold deposit and worth studying for its sources of metals and fluids. It is hosted by amphibole- to granulite-facies metamorphic rocks and Mesozoic intrusions, and controlled by NNE-, NE-trending compressional reverse faults and NW-trending extensional normal faults. The gold mineralization types include auriferous quartz veins and wall rock alterations of phyllic mineralization, pyritization, chloritization, and carbonatization. According to the crosscutting relationships of the veins and the mineral textures within the ore-bearing veins, four mineralization stages are recognized: clouded-white quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite (stage I), gray quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite (stage II), quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfides (stage III), and calcite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz (stage IV), among which the stages II and III represent the main gold mineralization stages. The timing of the gold mineralization is constrained to the Middle Triassic by zircon U-Pb ages of a pre-metallogenic diorite (258.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0Ma) and a ore-related granitic porphyry dike (241.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0Ma). Three types of fluid inclusions (FIs) in the quartz veins of four stages are identified: vapor-rich (type 1), CO2-H2O three-phase (type 2), and liquid-rich FIs (type 3). Their trapping temperatures gradually decrease from 352 \u2103 (stage I) to 124 \u2103 (stage IV), with salinities decreasing from 9.8 to 2.0\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv., indicating that the ore-forming fluids belong to a H2O-NaCl-CO2 system. The first three stages were characterized by moderate-high temperatures, a large variation in salinities, akin to those of the magmatic hydrothermal fluids. The H-O isotope compositions from the stage II (\u03b418Ow\u00a0=\u00a04.1\u20134.8\u2030 and \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0-110 to \u221287\u2030) to the stage III (\u03b418Ow\u00a0=\u00a03.5 to 3.7\u2030 and \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0-101 to \u221298\u2030), indicate that the ore-forming fluids were mainly magmatic fluids. The \u03b434SV-CDT (1.7\u20132.1\u2030), Pb isotopes (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.09\u201315.90, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.00\u201315.15, 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a035.76\u201337.97), and Os isotopes (initial 187Os\/188Os\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0) of the Au-bearing pyrite samples at the stages II and III, similar to those of the crust-derived magma, suggest that the gold and other metals were extracted from the partial melting of the lower crust. Accordingly, the Taijiying gold deposit is probably a magmatic hydrothermal deposit. The areas recording the Triassic batholith with a developed fault system would be prospective targets for gold mineralization in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district on the northern margin of the NCC.\n               ","69":"\n                  In this study, the effectiveness of different geophysical techniques is analysed in relation to the imaging of geological structures with mining interest. To achieve this goal, the old district of Linares-La Carolina (Southeast Spain) is chosen due to the presence of dense swarm of mineralised dykes, primarily consisting of galena (PbS). In particular, the western boundary of the mining district is studied. At this westernmost area the veins lose their continuity due to regional fractures which resulted in the abandoning of the extracting labours.\n                  Direct information from both the surface geology and several boreholes are used as ground-truth calibration and verification for the geophysical tools used in this study.\n                  The seismic response is characterised by high-amplitude reflectors, generally at the base of the sedimentary cover. The seismic profiles suggest lateral changes in the thickness and the existence of fractures affecting the sedimentary cover and\/or the top of the acoustic basement. However, this technique has proved ineffective when studying the Palaeozoic substrate, precisely at those areas where the veins are hosted.\n                  Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) studies suggest fractures and lateral changes in the facies, in both the sedimentary cover and the Palaeozoic basement. The basement shows phyllites in the granite intrusion, which are crucial for the elastic properties of the hosting rock and therefore indicate areas prone to further mineralisation. Time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) data, which is an excellent complement to the two previous techniques, have also been collected. Data have been taken with different configurations and varying measurement parameters at each sounding station. This approach has made it possible to compare the effectiveness benefits and drawbacks of the different methods.\n               ","70":"\n                  The Pangjiahe deposit is an orogenic gold deposit located on the northwestern margin of the Fengtai Basin and has proven reserves of 38\u00a0t Au at an average grade of 6.3\u00a0g\/t. Phyllite is widely distributed in the mining area with Triassic granite porphyry and diabase dykes intruded in faults crosscutting it. Gold mineralization is mainly hosted in phyllite rocks. The granite porphyry present in the deposit is locally mineralized when it shares the same space with ore-controlling faults. Pyrite always displays zoning textures: Py0 and Py1 are present in the core; rim Py2 replaces and\/or overgrows Py0 and Py1; and Py3 comprises the outermost rim. Previously determined in situ \u03b434S values indicate that Py0, Py1, and Py2 and Py3 are diagenetic, magmatic hydrothermal, and hydrothermal ore stage in origin, respectively. Electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) mapping of the zoned pyrite (especially Py2) shows a negative correlation between sulfur and arsenic, indicating the substitution of sulfur by As1-. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) mapping and spot analysis of Py2 and Py3 reveal two Au and As relationships. In the mineralized phyllite and granite porphyry, Au has strong positive correlations with As, Sb, Cu, and Ag, similar to other arsenian pyrites in hydrothermal ore deposits. However, in altered samples, Au and As display decoupled geochemical behavior, especially in Py2, which has the same levels of As, Sb, Cu, and Ag but 2\u20135 orders of magnitude lower Au. We think that the ore fluid reacted with altered samples located distal to the ore-controlling fault (distal to the ore fluid center), and the fluid may not have been sufficiently charged with those elements, especially Au. Because As, Sb, Cu, and Ag could maintain at the same level in the ore fluid after precipitation of pyrite enriched in those elements, but Au was sharply depleted. This was also noted in a published fluid inclusion study in Carlin-type gold deposits in Guizhou Province, which has similar zoned pyrite texture. Based on the similar \u03b434S values (8\u2030 and 10\u2030) and trace element enrichments (Au, As, Sb, Cu, and Ag) between hydrothermal ore-stage pyrite and the Devonian seafloor exhalation sequence in the Fengtai Basin, the source of the gold in the Pangjiahe deposit should be attributed to metamorphism of the Devonian seafloor exhalation sequence during the Triassic orogeny.\n               ","71":"\n                  The Kunlun River area, located in the central section of the East Kunlun orogenic belt and sandwiched between the Central and South Kunlun faults, includes a series of orogenic gold deposits (e.g., Heicigou, Dazaohuo, and Heihainan) that constitute a gold mineralization system closely related to the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic collisional orogeny. These gold deposits are mainly hosted by the Ordovician and early-middle Triassic metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and controlled by NWW- to NW-trending secondary faults. The orebodies occur as auriferous quartz veins and surrounding altered rocks accompanied by silicification, sulfidation, carbonatization, sericitization and chloritization. Fluid inclusions, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicate that the ore-forming fluids are characterized by moderate temperature (mostly 200\u2013250 \u2103), low salinity (2.8\u201310.2% NaCleq), and CO2-bearing metamorphic water. Carbon, sulfur, and lead isotopes indicate that the ore-forming materials were derived from sedimentary rocks. Based on the ages of capture zircons in the auriferous quartz veins and the emplacement time of regional A-type granites, the gold mineralization time is confined between 239 and 200\u00a0Ma. Combined with regional tectonic evolution, these deposits were formed in the stage of tectonic system transformation from compression to extension in the middle-late Triassic. During this period, the release of tectonic stress resulted in the upward migration of ore-forming fluids along the regional faults and the gold precipitation in the secondary faults in the shallow crust by fluid immiscibility and fluid-rock interaction.\n               ","72":"\n                  The Linwang gold deposit is a representative example of Carlin-type gold deposits in Youjiang basin, southwest China. High-grade ores are hosted in silicified and brecciated siltstone, sandstone, and mudstone of the Middle Triassic and are controlled by high-angle reverse faults. Optical microscopy pyrite texture, in situ laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) trace elements, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) multiple sulfur isotopes analyses are used to examine the different types of pyrites to constrain the sources of reduced sulfur and metals for the Linwang deposit.\n                  Petrography and pyrite chemistry studies distinguished three generations of pyrite: Pre-ore pyrite (Py 1) and ore pyrites (Py 2 and Py3). Pre-ore pyrite is framboidal, anhedral to euhedral pyrite with highest concentrations of Co, Ni, and Pb and is interpreted to have a sedimentary (diagenetic) origin. Ore pyrites were formed by hydrothermal fluids via sulfidation of Fe-bearing minerals in the host rocks. They commonly rimed and partially replaced the pre-ore pyrite and have an As-rich inner rim (Py 2) and an Au-rich outer rim (Py 3) with lowest contents of Co, Ni, and Pb. All pyrites contain Au, As, Sb, Cu, Tl, and Se, with increasing concentrations from Py 1 to Py 3.\n                  In situ SIMS multiple S isotope analyses show that all pyrites in the Linwang deposit have narrow ranges of \u03b434S values, with average of +5.13\u2030 for Py 1, +4.84\u2030 for Py 2, and +4.53\u2030 for Py 3, and near zero of \u039433S values (\u22120.02\u2030 to +0.03\u2030), suggesting that the S within the Linwang deposit was most likely sourced from the Triassic sedimentary rocks that host the deposit. A near zero \u039433S signature in all pyrites indicates no record of the assimilation of Archean sulfur, implying the deep basement of Archean rocks beneath the basin were not involved the formation of the Linwang deposit.\n                  Oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of ore fluids (\u03b418OH2O\u202f=\u202f+11.7\u2030 to +16.5\u2030, \u03b4D\u202f=\u202f\u221271\u2030 to \u221257\u2030) indicate a metamorphic origin. Based on these data, we propose a sedimentary source-rock model for the Linwang deposit in which the ore fluids were generated by release of previous Au-bearing sedimentary pyrites during metamorphism of sedimentary rocks. The stress relaxation of Yanshanian orogeny resulted in the ore fluids flowed upward along the fault zones into structural highs where they reacted with Fe-bearing minerals in the host rocks to deposit Au-rich pyrite. The preconcentration of Au, As, and Sb in sedimentary pyrite and gold deposition process are key to the formation of the Linwang deposit and may apply to the genesis of other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin.\n               ","73":"\n                  The Keyue Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag polymetallic deposit is located within the North Himalayan Metallogenic Belt (NHMB). This study aims to clarify whether the Keyue deposit has close association in time and space with magmatism, and discuss the significance for further exploration. Orebodies are hosted by the Lower Jurassic Ridang Formation black carbonaceous slate and controlled by the NE-trending faults. Keyue is characterized by multiple stages of hydrothermal veins, including Mn-Fe Carbonate-sulfide (I), quartz-sulfide-sulfosalt mineral (II) and quartz-calcite-stibnite veins (III).\n                  Hydrothermal minerals contain six types of fluid inclusions, including H2O-rich bi-phase aqueous (type I), pure CO2 (type II), CO2-rich H2O-CO2-NaCl tri-phase (type III), H2O-rich H2O-CO2-NaCl tri-phase (type IV), halite-bearing tri-phase (type V) and halite-bearing H2O-CO2-NaCl multiphase inclusions (type VI). All six types of inclusions were observed in stage II quartz, whereas only types I and III inclusions in stage I siderite and sphalerite and type I inclusions in stage III quartz and calcite. Type I inclusions in stage I display total homogenization temperatures (T\n                     h, total) ranging from 250.1 to 289.3\u00a0\u00b0C, with salinities of 9.6\u201316.3\u00a0wt% NaCleq. Types I, III, IV and V inclusions in stage II yield T\n                     h, total of 175.5\u2013282.7\u00a0\u00b0C, 188.8\u2013286.3\u00a0\u00b0C, 214.3\u2013287.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 198.3\u2013266.0\u00a0\u00b0C, with corresponding salinities of 4.0\u201321.5\u00a0wt% NaCleq, 0.6\u20132.9\u00a0wt% NaCleq, 0.0\u201311.0\u00a0wt% NaCleq and 30.1\u201333.2\u00a0wt% NaCleq, respectively. Type I inclusions in stage III have T\n                     h,total values of 172.3\u2013240.7\u00a0\u00b0C and salinities of 3.1\u201312.6\u00a0wt% NaCleq. Fluid phase separation occurred in stages I and II, resulting in CO2 and H2S release, pH increase and rapid Pb-Zn-Ag precipitation, whereas mixing of magmatic fluids and meteoric water in stage III caused the cooling, dilution and stibnite precipitation.\n                  Fluid inclusion analysis and C-H-O isotopic compositions indicate that the initial hydrothermal fluids were magmatic water, with increasing input of meteoric water with time. The \u03b434SCDT values of sulfides from three stages are similar and range from 4.8 to 10.3 \u2030 (average 7.7 \u2030), showing characteristics of mixture of magmatic and sedimentary sulfur. The Pb isotopic compositions of sulfides are closely consistent with those of Cenozoic leucogranite and Precambrian metamorphic crystalline basement in the NHMB, suggesting that the ore-forming metals were sourced from the hidden causative Himalayan leucogranite formed by the decompression melting of metamorphic crystalline domains.\n                  Combining evidence from geochronology, fluid inclusions, isotopes suggest that the Keyue Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag and Cuonadong W-Sn-Be mineralization at different locations around the Cuonadong Dome constitute an integrated magmatic-hydrothermal system, with the distal end-member Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag veins centered on the Cuonadong leucogranites-related W-Sn-Be mineralization. Pegmatite-skarn-type W-Sn-Be polymetallic mineralization may occur at deeper sites beneath the Keyue area, and the distal Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag veins controlled by faults within strata also need more attention around these leucogranite domes in the NHMB.\n               ","74":"\n                  The Kuruer Cu-Au deposit is located in the Wusun Range of Yili Block, Chinese Western Tianshan, where numerous epithermal Au, skarn Fe-Cu and porphyry Mo-Cu deposits have been recognized. Petrography, fluid inclusions, S-Pb-H-O isotopes, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) plus energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) have been carried out to constrain the genesis of the Kuruer deposit and its implication for further exploration. The minerlization is hosted by volcanic rocks and occur as veins and veinlets structurally controlled by NW-trending faults. Three ore-forming stages were recognized, including quartz-sulfides-bismuth-gold stage (I), quartz-chalcopyrite stage (II) and calcite-chlorite-chalcopyrite stage (III).\n                  Six types of fluid inclusions were identified in stage I quartz, including monophase vapor inclusions (type 1), liquid-rich biphase inclusions (type 2), vapor-rich biphase inclusions (type 3), H2O-rich CO2-H2O triphase inclusions (type 4), CO2-rich CO2-H2O triphase inclusions (type 5) and solid halite-bearing triphase inclusions (type 6), whereas only type 2 inclusions were recognized in stage II quartz and stage III calcite. Types 2, 3, 4 and 6 inclusions in stage I have homogenization temperature (T\n                     h) ranges of 184\u2013359\u00a0\u00b0C, 209\u2013252\u00a0\u00b0C, 250\u2013319\u00a0\u00b0C and 229\u2013263\u00a0\u00b0C, with salinity ranges of 4.1\u20138.5\u00a0wt% NaCleq, 5.9\u20136.9\u00a0wt% NaCleq, 1.0\u20136.0\u00a0wt% NaCleq and 32.7\u201333.9\u00a0wt% NaCleq, respectively. Type 2 inclusions in stages II and III have T\n                     h varying from 144 to 212\u00a0\u00b0C and 114 to 163\u00a0\u00b0C, with salinities of 0.2\u20136.7\u00a0wt% NaCleq and 0.1\u20133.1\u00a0wt% NaCleq, respectively.\n                  The in-situ \u03b434S values of sulfides in stage I range from \u22124.66 to 0.34\u2030. The 206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb, and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios of stage I chalcopyrite vary from 18.295 to 18.954, 15.568 to 15.673 and 38.109 to 38.817, respectively, which are consistent with those of Early Carboniferous Dahalajunshan Formation volcanic rocks and granitoids from the Wusun Range. The values of \u03b418OH2O-VSMOW calculated from \u03b418Oquartz and \u03b4DH2O-VSMOW of stage I quartz range from 0.0 to 2.4\u2030 and \u2212118.6 to \u2212109.3\u2030, respectively. These isotopic compositions indicate that both metals and sulfur were sourced from the hosting volcanic rocks and hidden causative pluton, while the initial ore-forming fluids were magmatic in origin, with increasing involvement of meteoric water with time.\n                  Evidence from mineralogy, mineral geochemistry and fluid inclusions indicates that the initial fluid phase separation triggered the precipitation of \u201cinvisible\u201d gold within pyrite and chalcopyrite during stage I. Subsequently, the decrease of f\n                     S2 due to the escape of H2S(g) and sulfide precipitation and cooling caused the formation of liquid bismuth from solutions. The bismuth melts have scavenged Au in situ from the residual solutions, resulting in the formation of Bi-Au inclusions within the fractures and intergranular spaces of earlier pyrite. For stages II and III, dilution and cooling due to input of meteoric water facilitated the chalcopyrite precipitation. The Kuruer Cu-Au deposit is classified as a subepithermal mineralization associated with porphyries. Porphyry Cu-Au mineralization could have developed beneath the Kuruer and its vicinity.\n               ","75":"\n                  To determine the origin of the Shamsabad Fe-Mn deposit, LA-ICP-MS geochemistry in pyrolusite and the sulfur isotopes in galena were studied. The ore is lenticular and is hosted in Lower Cretaceous limestones. Hematite, iron hydroxides and pyrolusite are the ore minerals, accompanied by subordinate todorokite, coronadite, calcite, quartz, pyrite, galena, rhodochrosite and malachite. Field and petrographic evidence, including lamination and colloform textures of the ore and the presence of conformable limestone lenses within the ore, suggest a synsedimentary hydrothermal origin to the mineralization. In addition, the enrichment of As, Ba, Cu, Pb and Zn and depletion of Co and Ti in the pyrolusite is similar to hydrothermal Fe-Mn deposits. The LREE\/HREE ratio, low \u03a3REE values and negative Ce anomalies indicate that hydrothermal fluids played an important role in mineralization. The Mn\/Fe, Co\/Ni, Co\/Zn, La\/Ce, LaN\/NdN, DyN\/YbN, and Y\/Ho ratios, as well as all discriminative element diagrams for trace and major elements, are consistent with hydrothermal deposits. The \u03b434S values of the galena samples indicate that the sulfur originated from magmatic fluids, probably partially mixed with Lower Cretaceous seawater. According to the proposed hydrothermal-sedimentary genetic model, the hydrothermal solutions leaked into the sedimentary basin primarily through possible deep-seated faults in the bedrock. Hydrothermal fluids were enriched in ore-forming materials through leaching from the rocks with which they were in contact. The leakage of the metal-bearing hydrothermal solutions into the sedimentary basin and mixing with seawater altered the Eh-pH conditions, resulting in the deposition of ore materials in the Shamsabad deposit.\n               ","76":"\n                  In general, highly evolved and reduced magmatic systems are favorable for W-Sn mineralization and Mo-Cu mineralization can occur in low differentiated oxidized ones. However, it is not clear how coexisting W-Mo mineralization can form in a magmatic system. To characterize the genetic linkage between contemporaneous magmatic rocks in a magmatic system related to W\u2013Mo mineralization, we investigated whole-rock geochemistry, geochronology, and Hf-Pb isotopic signatures from ore-related granodiorites and monzogranites in the Hahaigang W-Mo deposit, Tibet. The primary mineralization of the Hahaigang deposit shows a W\u00a0\u2192\u00a0W-Mo\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization zone along the Dalong fault zones from NE to SW. The stockworks and disseminated W-Mo orebodies are hosted in the skarn near the monzogranite and granodiorite. Zircon U-Pb ages of the monzogranite and granodiorite are 64.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma and 64.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma, respectively. These ages are consistent with the previous ages obtained from molybdenite Re-Os isochron dating, revealing that the Hahaigang W-Mo mineralization formed during the syn-collisional stage of the Indian and Asian plates. Metal sulfide S-Pb isotopes indicate that the ore-forming materials were mainly derived from granitic magma. The two granitoids that belong to the high-potassium and peraluminous calc-alkali I-type granites have similar Hf-Pb isotopic characteristics, indicating that they represent a felsic magma system and have been derived from a similar source. The monzogranite, with a spectacular tetrad effect in its REE distribution patterns, has higher negative Eu anomalies than the granodiorite, reflecting that it has more highly fractionated features. Meanwhile, it has lower whole-rock Fe2O3\/FeO and zircon Ce4+\/Ce3+ ratios than the granodiorite, suggesting that the granodiorite has higher oxygen fugacity than monzogranite. The formation of monzogranite is attributed to the fractionation crystallization of feldspar and Fe-Ti-oxide during magmatic evolution. Thus, this study clarifies that W-Mo mineralization can form in an evolved magmatic system undergoing different degrees of fractionation and having different redox state. Combined with the results of previous studies, at least four generations of W-dominated polymetallic metallogenic events are observed in the Lhasa terrane. Because the highly evolved magmatic system is common in the Lhasa terrane with crustal thickening, this system with existing mineralization may provide useful information about regional-scale tungsten potential and guide its exploration.\n               ","77":"\n                  The eastern block of the North China Craton (NCC) has been completely decratonized and it hosts numerous early Cretaceous gold deposits dated at about 130\u2013120\u00a0Ma. The Jiaodong Peninsula in the easternmost NCC is the largest gold producing district in China, and it hosts more than 150 gold deposits with known gold resources of over 5000 tonnes (t). Also located at the eastern margin of NCC, the Liaodong Peninsula is poorly explored at depths greater than 800\u00a0m, with no large concealed gold deposit being discovered yet. In this paper, we carefully analyzed the gravity and magnetic characteristics of the ore-controlling structures in both provinces, including faults, Precambrian basement metamorphic rocks and the Mesozoic granitic intrusions. The deep regional faults are characterized by linear gravity gradient zones or elongated positive magnetic anomalies. The Precambrian basement metamorphic rocks usually have large-amplitude gravity and magnetic highs, while the lithological contacts of Mesozoic granite intrusions are commonly defined by gravity lows or narrow magnetic high anomalies. Interpretations from gravity and magnetic signatures predict two concealed lithological contacts between Mesozoic granites and Precambrian metamorphic rocks beneath Liaodong and Jiaodong.\n                  The spatial locations of known gold deposits are then correlated with the concealed structures inferred from the gravity and magnetic data in our paper. Their spatial relationship suggests that the gold mineralization is mainly controlled by oblique regional faults along the structural and lithological contacts between Mesozoic granites and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. Additionally, the structural intersections of different ore-controlling faults, especially the hydrothermal alteration zones at the contacts between Precambrian basement metamorphic rocks and the Mesozoic granites, are most favorable for the gold mineralization in the Liaodong and Jiaodong areas. Many large gold deposits are documented along a deep-seated, but concealed, structure beneath the Jiaodong gold district, while the Qingchengzi ore field and its vicinity in the Liaodong Peninsula still remain underexplored, despite of having a very similar structural setting, and deserve further investigation.\n               ","78":"\n                  The Bilugangan porphyry Mo deposit is located in the southern Great Xing'an Range, and the Bilugangan area near the Hegenshan-Heihe Fault in the eastern part of the Central Asian Orogen (CAO). The deposit is hosted by a NE-trending, partly concealed, composite granite consisting of highly altered porphyritic granite (G1), porphyritic monzogranite (G2), fine- to medium-grained monzogranite (G3), medium -grained monzogranite (G4), and monzogranitic porphyry dykes (G5). The Mo mineralisation forms hydrothermal stockworks or disseminated sulphides in the G2 and G3 phases and the adjoining hornfels. Magmatic zircons from the intrusions yield 206Pb\/238U weighted mean ages of 295\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for G1, 240\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma for G2, 235\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for G3, 230\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma for G4, and 100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for G5,indicating that multiple magmatic events have been active during the Early Permian to Early Cretaceous emplacement of the Bilugangan Granite. The age of the Mo is constrained between the Middle and Late Triassic and the magma-related hydrothermal activity proceeded in at least two pulses over a period of around 5\u00a0Ma. The first pulse has a molybdenite Re-Os weighted mean age of 238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma, and the second dates at 236\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma. These dates are coeval with those of G2 and G3, indicating a genetic association between them and the mineralisation.\n                  The Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic systematics shows that the Bilugangan Granite was probably formed by partial melting of at least two sources. The first source is a dominant Late Mesoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous juvenile lower crust indicated by the whole rock \u03b5\n                     Nd(t) values of \u22121.9 to 5.1 and zircon \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) values of 3.5 to 14.3 with two-stage depleted mantle Nd (TDM2) and Hf (t\n                     DM2) model ages of ca. 1086 to 350\u00a0Ma, which is possibly related to the evolution of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean. The second source includes Neoarchaean to Palaeoproterozoic crustal components and a subordinate Mesoproterozoic crustal component. The Neoarchaean to Palaeoproterozoic component is indicated by the presence of ca. 2700 to 2600\u00a0Ma xenocrystic zircons, negative \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) values of \u221216.4 to \u221210.1 with t\n                     DM2 ages of ca. 2300 to 1900\u00a0Ma. The Mesoproterozoic component yields \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) values of \u22124.5 to 1.1 and t\n                     DM2 ages of ca. 1600 to 1200\u00a0Ma. These data show that pre- Mesoproterozoic substrate is present beneath the southern Great Xing'an Range. Although the post-mineralisation G4 and G5 phases have comparable positive \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) values with the earlier granitic phases, the G2 and G3 phases have a more complex source with distinctly negative \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) values of \u221216.4 to \u20131.3, indicating that the older crustal components in the magma\u2019s source are also probable sources for the Mo mineralisation.\n               ","79":"\n                  Investigating hydrocarbon alteration characteristics and the alteration mechanism of faded sandstone in uranium-bearing red beds is important for understanding the relationship between hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and uranium mineralization. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted on the faded alteration sandstone of the Cretaceous Luohe Formation in Pengyang area of the southwestern Ordos Basin. The results show that the faded alteration of the Luohe Formation is consistent with temporal and spatial pyritization and uranium mineralization and that the alteration degree can be divided into three alteration levels: gray green to gray, yellow to gray white, and reddish brown to light red. Moreover, hydrocarbon alteration is observed in the faded sandstones with good permeability in the Luohe Formation, appearing as oil traces on fresh rock surface, diffuse fluorescence in the cement, hydrocarbon inclusions around fractures, and organic components in pores. In addition, the content of hydrocarbon increases with increasing faded alteration degree. The following results are obtained: (1) The most typical mineralogical response characteristics of hydrocarbon alteration are the decreasing change of trivalent iron oxide and the enrichment of pyrite and uranium minerals with a symbiotic relationship. (2) The hydrocarbon alteration intensity is generally weakened from bottom to bottom and enhanced from southwest to northeast. Except for in the northwest, which is controlled by fault migration, hydrocarbon micro leakage is the main mechanism. (3) Hydrocarbon alteration as a reduction mechanism is mainly affected by the sedimentary environment of the Luohe Formation and the oxidation conditions of the surface fluid, scale of fault, permeability of deep rock, and intensity of hydrocarbon generation and emission from deep source rocks.\n               ","80":"\n                  For sandstone-type uranium deposits, an unobstructed recharge-runoff-discharge (RRD) groundwater system strongly constrained by tectonic events is one of the most important cornerstones for uranium mineralization. Junggar Basin, located in NW China, is proposed to be an intracontinental Mesozoic basin with great sandstone-type uranium metallogenic potential but no large uranium deposits so far. Compared with other uranium-bearing basins in Northern China, the Junggar Basin experienced episodic strong tectonic events in the Meso-Cenozoic era, resulting in more intense stratigraphic deformation and dislocation, so the detailed analysis of tectonic evolution and ore-controlling structures is indispensable to deciphering the uranium mineralization process in the region. This study interprets the seismic profiles and analyzes the apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronological signatures of the Jurassic Toutunhe Formation detrital sediments in the eastern Junggar Basin, which reveals that the Junggar Basin experienced four tectonic events: the Middle Triassic-Early Jurassic episodic uplift of basin margin (ca. 240\u2013180\u00a0Ma), the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous modest deformation and uplift within the basin (ca. 140\u00a0Ma), the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene rapid uplift (ca. 100\u201360\u00a0Ma), the Eocene-Present episodic rapid uplift (ca. 38\u20130\u00a0Ma). On this basis, the tectonic couples comprising tectonic window and structural pattern is dissected. The ore-controlling structures that can build the good RRD system are identified, such as Jurassic slope in the eastern Luliang Uplift, Jurassic hanging wall of fault propagation fold, Neogene foredeep of the foreland basin, and so on. Meanwhile, the rapid uplifts in ca.100\u201360\u00a0Ma and ca.38\u20130\u00a0Ma are ascertained as the key tectonic events constrained uranium mineralization. Afterward, a uranium metallogenic model based on the thread of basin tectonic evolution is established, which is of great significance for further deployment of uranium exploration in the basin.\n               ","81":"\n                  Oilfield waters represent an important source of lithium resources to meet increasing global demand. However, the distribution of Li resources in the western Qaidam Basin is still unclear, and the enrichment mechanism of Li remains to be explained. In this study, we present new hydrochemical data for all the oil-bearing anticlines in the Qaidam Basin. Oilfield waters in the Nanyishan and Dafengshan oilfields are characterized by Li concentrations ranging from 110.1 to 237.5\u00a0mg\/L, and Mg concentrations ranging from 0.70 to 1.52\u00a0g\/L. These concentrations are readily recovered and represent a key target for oilfield water exploitation in the future. In oilfield water samples from the Qaidam Basin, \u03b47Li values show large variation, possibly implying multiple sources of Li, including residual water from ancient lakes, alpine snow water infiltrating along deep faults, springs, and deep hydrothermal fluids. \u03b47Li values of the oilfield waters from Nanyishan and Dafengshan are lower than those of the river and spring water samples, but close to those of volcanic rocks around the world. These results indicate that the oilfield waters with significant Li-enrichment are associated with local hydrothermal activity. This is the first time that the \u03b47Li data of oilfield waters in the Qaidam Basin have been reported. It appears that \u03b47Li is a good tracer for determining the origin and the key controlling factors of Li accumulation processes in oilfield waters.\n               ","82":"\n                  Surface nanoparticles in nature have become important research objects because they contain information about the deep Earth. In this study, nanoparticles were analyzed via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) in gradient media (groundwater, ascending gas, and soil) on the surface overlying the concealed Shaling gold deposit in China, which was buried more than 1000\u00a0m below the surface. The morphologies, ultramicroscopic structure, and chemical composition of the nanoparticles were analyzed via High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM), Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). These nanoparticles were characterized as (i) Amorphous Nano-Particles (ANPs), (ii) Amorphous-and-Crystalline-mixed Nano-Particles (A&C mixed NPs), and (iii) Crystallized Nano-Particles (CNPs). Furthermore, the newly proposed A&C mixed NPs were further classified into wrapped-, adsorbed- and coexisting-type nanoparticles. The ANPs exhibited a disorderly arrangement, A&C mixed NPs comprised amorphous materials as well as crystalline grains, and CNPs predominantly consisted of crystallized bodies. Oxidized particles derived from concealed ore bodies contain ore-related information and migrate to the surface via the flow of groundwater and ascending gas along faults. Among these particles, amorphous-bearing nanoparticles can contain elements with similar geochemical behaviors, such as Ca and Zn. Overall, this study provides a new basis for the exploration of concealed ore bodies.\n               ","83":"\n                  The Laowangou gold deposit is a newly discovered Au deposit in the North Qinling orogenic belt. Based on megascopic and microscopic textural relationships and mineral assemblages, the hydrothermal alteration and mineralization of the Laowangou Au deposit have been divided into porphyry-type (including potassic, chlorite-epidote and mica-quartz alteration stages) and overprinting mineralization periods. Hypogene Au mineralization mainly occurred as muscovite\u00a0+\u00a0quartz\u00a0+\u00a0Au-bearing pyrite veins during the overprinting mineralization period, and developed in the fault and fracture zone. SWIR analyses indicate that alteration minerals in the Laowangou Au deposit are chlorite (including Mg chlorite, Fe chlorite, and Fe-Mg chlorite), epidote and white micas with less dolomite, brucite and calcite. Two types of white mica are recognized at Laowangou. Type A white mica partially replaces plagioclase and K-feldspar in the Tangzang quartz diorite, representing the mica-quartz stage, whereas Type B white mica coexists with Au-bearing pyrite, quartz, calcite, and mainly developed in the fracture zone, representing the overprinting mineralization period. Compared with metamorphic minerals, Laowangou porphyry-related chlorite shows lower Al, Ti, and As, but higher Sr concentrations; porphyry-related epidote has higher Ti and Bi, but lower As concentrations. Type B white mica has lower Fe and Mg contents, but larger particle sizes and illite crystallinity (IC) values than Type A white mica, similar to geochemical characteristics of metamorphic white mica. These evidences indicate the Laowangou Au mineralization is different from typical magmatic-hydrothermal Au deposits, and the ore-forming fluid related to Au mineralization may have derived from the depth along faults. Higher wavelength of the Al-OH absorption (>2210\u00a0nm) and IC values (>1.2) of white mica can be used as effective vector toward high grade Au mineralization (>1 g\/t) in the Laowangou Au deposit.\n               ","84":"\n                  Pulang is the largest porphyry Cu-Au deposit that formed in the Late Triassic and is located in the eastern Tethys. Its ore-forming fluids and mineral assemblages show some reducing characteristics. Magma and fluid are two key parameters in porphyry mineralization. Studies have shown that syn-mineralization quartz monzonite porphyries have higher oxygen fugacities, which are conducive to mineralization. However, this does not answer the question of why the deposit has reducing characteristics, which should be positively related to fluid activity. Based on detailed geologic observation, hydrothermal evolution and ore-forming process have been divided into three successive periods, namely, pre-mineralization, syn-mineralization (subdivided into three stages, including early-, inter-, and late-mineralization, corresponding to stage 1, 2, and 3 veins), and post-mineralization, in the Pulang deposit. The corresponding fluid inclusions and sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfides are studied on this basis. The results show that the salinity ranges of the stage 1 and stage 2 veins are larger, which indicates that fluid immiscibility may exist. Pyrrhotite is developed in some of the stage 2 veins, and their fluid inclusions contain CH4. However, CH4 was not found in fluid inclusions in veins that do not contain pyrrhotite. The homogenization temperatures and salinities of the fluid inclusions decrease gradually, and the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes gradually approach the meteoric water line overall, from premineralization to postmineralization. Furthermore, sulfur isotopes of pyrrhotite are the highest, indicating a possible additional source of sedimentary sulfur. That is, the ore-forming fluids were dominated by magmatic water, and meteoric water was added in the late stage as the fluid evolved. The trend of the Heishuitang fault is consistent with the extension of the main ore body in the mining area. Because the strata is affected by faults, the strata acts as a good channel for meteoric water. Meteoric water was added to the magmatic fluid after extraction and carried organic matter from the Tumugou Formation and along the cracks. The fluid was mixed, and the ore-forming elements were effectively precipitated in a reducing environment. Therefore, pyrrhotite and CH4 occur in some veins. That may be why the Pulang deposit is giant.\n               ","85":"\n                  The Jiaodong Peninsula in eastern China hosts numerous large and giant gold deposits. Recently, a set of gold deposits distributed along the Guocheng Fault have been identified as a new gold mineralization type, of which the Longkou\u2013Tudui gold deposit is spatially associated with the Muniushan monzogranite whereas its genesis is poorly constrained. A systematic study including zircon U-Pb dating, fluid inclusions, C\u2013H\u2013O\u2013S stable isotopes was carried out in order to determine the genesis of the Longkou\u2013Tudui gold deposit. Zircon dating results indicate that the Muniushan monzogranite and dioritic porphyrite were emplaced at 2089\u20132066\u00a0Ma (with a metamorphism probably occurring at 1860\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027\u00a0Ma, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.98) and 115.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, respectively. Combined with cross-cutting relationships of the Muniushan monzogranite, dioritic porphyrite, and gold orebodies, it is inferred that the gold mineralization occurred in the early Cretaceous. Fluid inclusion study demonstrates a H2O\u2013NaCl\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CO2 system, with a progressive decrease in average values of homogenization temperature and salinity from pre-ore to post-ore stages but a slight increase in bulk density. The ore-forming fluid is characterized by reductive, acidic, high to middle temperature, low salinity, and low density as revealed by a combined study on fluid inclusion and stable isotopes. H\u2013O\u2013C\u2013S isotopic compositions indicate that the ore-forming materials have multiple sources including an inherited S source from the Jingshan Group, a mantle-derived C source, and a mixed H\u2013O source induced by the addition of meteoric water. Compared with other Jiaodong gold deposits, the Longkou\u2013Tudui deposit does not differ in mineralization age, nature and evolution of ore-forming fluid, and source of ore-forming materials except for orebody occurrence and heavier \u03b434S values inherited from the Jingshan Group, and this deposit was a byproduct of oceanic subduction of the Paleo Pacific Ocean.\n               ","86":"\n                  The newly discovered Huangtan Au-Cu deposit is located in the central Dananhu - Tousuquan arc of Eastern Tianshan, southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). It is the first Au-dominated volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) polymetallic deposit in the Eastern Tianshan. Veinlet-disseminated and massive orebodies are hosted within Early Silurian pyritic phyllic tuff and volcanic breccia and controlled by a secondary fracture zone of the Kalatag fault with extensive hydrothermal alteration. Four primary alteration\/mineralization stages have been recognized as follows: (1) Early ore stage (S1), forming mainly ore-barren fine quartz veins with minor gold-bearing sulfides; (2) main ore stage (S2), forming mainly thick quartz veins with abundant coarse-grained subhedral pyrite (S2-1), and plentiful chalcopyrite, sphalerite, barite and Au-bearing sulfide veins (S2-2); (3) late ore stage (S3), which is characterized by plenty of barren quartz\u2013calcite veins with few sulfides; and (4) supergene stage (S4), accompanied by abundant oxide mineralization, including malachite, jarosite and other supergene minerals. From S1 to S3, microthermometric data of fluid inclusions show homogenization temperatures of 263\u2013379\u00a0\u00b0C (mean\u00a0=\u00a0308\u00a0\u00b0C), 188-292\u00a0\u00b0C (mean\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0\u00b0C), and 118-198\u00a0\u00b0C (mean\u00a0=\u00a0158\u00a0\u00b0C), respectively, and salinities of 5.3\u201314.2 (mean\u00a0=\u00a010.8) wt.% NaCl equiv., 2.8\u201310.7 (mean\u00a0=\u00a07.6) wt.% NaCl equiv., and 0.3\u201314.1 (mean\u00a0=\u00a02.6) wt.% NaCl equiv., respectively.

The \u03b418OH2O and \u03b4DV-SMOW values of fluid inclusions in each metallogenic stage range from \u22126.1 to 5.6\u2030 and \u221266.8 to \u221253.9\u2030, respectively, suggesting the dominant role of magmatic water mixed with convectively circulating heated seawater during fluid evolution. Fluid cooling dilution, local boiling, and fluid mixing were considered as the main mechanisms of metal precipitation. The 40Ar-39Ar plateau age of hydrothermal muscovite from the late ore stage (S3) is 414.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma, which represents the upper limit age of shallow hydrothermal alteration and Au-Cu mineralization. It is also consistent with the Early Silurian polymetallic metallogenic event in the Kalatag district. The auriferous Huangtan and adjacent Cu-Zn-rich Huangtupo VMS deposits show obvious ore-forming element differences, and constitute a unique VMS metallogenic system in the Eastern Tianshan Orogenic Belt (ETOB), which provides an important research object and new insight for ore prospecting in the peripheral Gobi Desert area.\n               ","87":"\n                  Channel ironstone deposits (CID) represent a unique variety of iron-rich sedimentary rocks, which are mostly found in Northern Kazakhstan and in Western Australia.

This study investigates the nature of the Lisakovsk CID and assesses the iron source(s) and the paleo-depositional conditions. Four lithofacies representing fluvial and deltaic channel environments have been identified. Ooids, peloids and micro-oncoids are allogenic, while proto-ooids formed authigenically.

Upper Cretaceous marine ooidal ironstones are the main iron source for the Lisakovsk CID, sourcing most of the metal content. Similarly, major oxides and trace metals of the Lisakovsk CID are derived primarily from the underlying marine ironstone. However, the REE patterns reveal a complex origin of the CID, including hydrogenic, diagenetic and hydrothermal. The Lisakovsk deposit formed in three stages. The first stage involved the uplift and erosion of Cretaceous ironstone and the establishment of paleo-drainage pattern along major faults. During the second stage, iron-rich detritus got redeposited along fluvial channels. The cement of the original ironstones was dissolved, while ooids, peloids, and micro-oncoids remained unaltered in the fluvial and deltaic channel environments.

Mineralization is controlled by a strike-slip fault and occurs as barren milky quartz veins, disseminated gold-bearing pyrite and arsenopyrite in the Early Paleozoic sandstone, siltstone and limestone. Gold is invisibly and ionically bound in arsenopyrite and pyrite or locally occurs as isolated native gold crystals (micron scale). Wall rock alteration includes sulfide, silicic, sericite and decarbonized alterations. Three hydrothermal mineralizing stages (I, II, III) can be identified: milky quartz-pyrite (I), quartz-sericite-pyrite-arsenopyrite (II) and dolomite-calcite-quartz (III). Different from those deposit in Dian-Qian-Gui, numerous plutons intruded in and around the mine.

The syenite dikes yielded zircon U\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Pb ages of ca. 35.8\u00a0Ma and the lamprophyre yielded similar Ar-Ar age of ca. 36.6\u00a0Ma, largely constraining the age of Au mineralization. In situ S\u2013Pb isotopic compositions for ore pyrite and arsenopyrite were measured by fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS. Sulfides from Chang\u2019an show a uniform range from \u20136.4\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a04.6\u2030, a typical characteristic of magmatic-derived S. Such sulfur isotopic compositions are similar to those of sulfides from Carlin-type Au deposits, but different from those of sulfides from orogenic-type deposit, which commonly exhibit a wide range of \u03b434S values. Pb isotopic ratios of pyrite and arsenopyrite are similar to those of the intrusive rocks in the deposit with more radiogenic Pb, suggesting that the metal is probably sourced from the coeval intrusive rocks and sedimentary wall rocks. Combined with the low Au concentrations of the sedimentary wall rocks, Au in the Chang\u2019an deposit are probably sourced from the intrusive rocks. Differences between the Chang\u2019an deposit and typical orogenic-type Au deposit include: (1) Orebodies in the Chang\u2019an deposit exhibit transitional contact relationship with the host rocks and boundaries between them are defined by cut-off grade while these boundaries in typical orogenic-type deposits are clearly defined. (2) Sulfidized and decarbonized alterations are quite significant in the Chang\u2019an deposit but commonly absent in typical orogenic-type deposits. (3) The Chang\u2019an deposit have lower CO2 contents of ore-forming fluids and more shallow ore-forming depth relative to typical orogenic-type deposits. Based on the ore deposit geology, dating and isotopic data, the Chang\u2019an mineralization is similar to typical Carlin-type gold deposit, formed by ore fluids originated from a deep magmatic S source in an post-collisional intracontinental setting at ca. 36\u00a0Ma.\n               ","89":"\n                  The Mn-bearing Buritirama Formation is composed of clastic and chemical metasedimentary rocks representing a Rhyacian platformal basin (ca. 2.18\u20132.06\u00a0Ga) that limits the northern border of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Caraj\u00e1s domain with the Paleoproterozoic Bacaj\u00e1 domain in the southern Amazon Craton, northern Brazil.

The extremely high concentrations (~80% areal coverage) characterized by overlapping nodules are apparently associated with downslope movement, possibly triggered by block movement along the fault slip plane or by gravity processes. Our results indicate that seamount sector collapse may have provided sufficient nucleus material for nodule growth and contributed to high nodule concentrations locally. The destruction of submarine volcanic edifices is universal, and the debris aprons and plains around such seamounts are potential prospecting areas for manganese nodule resources throughout the NPIB.\n               ","91":"\n                  The Jinya Au deposit is a representative example of the Carlin-type Au mineralization located within the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d area of the Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, China. The deposit is located within a fault zone at the contact between a carbonate platform and contains Au mineralization hosted by arsenopyrite and pyrite, with the latter providing evidence of changes in fluid composition during pyrite growth. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images indicate that this Au-bearing zoned pyrite can be divided into dark cores (Py1), lighter colored central sections (Py2), and dark rims (Py3). Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses provide information on compositional and S isotopic variations within this pyrite. These data indicate that each pyrite zone is compositionally homogeneous, showing Co\/Ni ratios of\u00a0<1. Pyrite has \u03b434S values ranging from \u20138.54\u2030 to \u20134.05\u2030, with Py1, Py2, and Py3 having average \u03b434S values of \u20136.89\u2030, \u20135.60\u2030, and \u20135.99\u2030, respectively. These values are indicative of thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) processes. Mineralizing fluids that formed the deposit derived from a sedimentary source mixed with variable amounts of meteoric water (Py1\u00a0=\u00a03%; Py2\u00a0=\u00a032%; Py3\u00a0=\u00a023%). The ore-forming fluids within the sedimentary basin metasomatized the Fe-rich dolomitic rocks of the forming the early pyrite cores (Py1). This fluid flow focused along the main fault zone, which at this time was permeable, allowing with an influx of meteoric water. This mixing process lowered the temperature of the system, causing the precipitation of large volumes of Au and As. This caused the formation of the light-colored and As- and Au-enriched central parts of the pyrite within the deposit (i.e., Py2). A subsequent decrease in the amount of meteoric water in the system led the formation of the darker Py3 rims that contain low concentrations of As and Au.\n               ","92":"\n                  The Isles of Jersey and Guernsey, GB, are situated in the Bight of St. Malo which ranks among the upper-macrotidal environments with one of the highest tidal ranges ever measured on the globe. They are built up of metasedimentary and \u2013magmatic basement rocks followed by a suite of gabbro-diorite-granite intrusive rocks. Based on sedimentological, geomorphological and mineralogical investigations focused on heavy minerals (HM) the coastal environment has been subdivided into three principal coastal types headland-, headland-bay and bay types. Chemical and physical weathering, neotectonics, eustatic sea level changes, wave action, land-derived sediment supply and aeolian processes had not only a strong impact on the various coastal landform series (CLFS) established but also on the variegated HM assemblages casting them into the role of markers for the coastal environment and some kind of an ore guide for marine placer deposits. Tidal-dominated coastal environments under study sculptured exclusively out of crystalline bedrocks are conservative with regard to the economic geology and potential of HM placer-type deposits provided while physical weathering predominates over the chemical one. The tidal processes in context with the other land-forming processes are special importance for the diversity of coastal features within the environment hosting HM on a small- and large-scale. Neotectonics may accentuated or suppress tidally-controlled features in that strong uplift and provokes typical tidal features to get suppressed so that vast tidal flats are missing in a great deal of coastal areas and rocky coasts formed instead with consequences for the accumulation of HM. The \u201cGMS tool (granulometry-morphology-situmetry) has methodologically proved to be very effective for the study of the coastal zones hosting HM in two principal ways. Granulometric and the morphological variation of HM can successfully be used for the host rock environment analysis (\u201core guide\u201d). Morphometric studies and situmetric measurements of gravel clasts in the coastal sediments bearing HM accompanied by similar measurement of joints and faults cutting through the bedrock can assist in the localization of HM trap sites in shoreline platforms and their rock veneer. The HM associations in upper-macrotidal environments are variegated in terms of morphology, mineralogical composition and their geomorphological trap sites so that they constitute a natural laboratory for environment analysis in terms of hydrodynamic and (paleo) climate along marine terrigenous shorelines and help better understand the way of HM from source to trap site in modern and paleoplacers.\n               ","93":"\n                  The Wuhe area in eastern Anhui province, hosting 23 metric tons of gold, has been recognized as a new gold ore cluster in the North China Craton (NCC) since the Hekou gold deposit was discovered in 2017. Its metallogenic setting and ore-forming process remain unclear. In this contribution, we perform a combined geology, cathodoluminescence, fluid inclusion, H-O isotope and pyrite Rb-Sr geochronologic studies on the Hekou gold deposit of the Wuhe area. In order to perform detailed fluid inclusion petrography study, we used scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) on a well preserved sulfides-bearing quartz grain from the auriferous quartz vein. In this quartz grain, generation A barren quartz in the core zone (QA, CL-white), minor sulfides bearing generation B (QB, CL-light gray) in intermediate zone and sulfides rich generation C (QC, CL-dark gray) in the distal zone and fractures were revealed. Only in QC, the higher carbonic proportion (50\u201380\u00a0vol%) inclusions (CC) coexist with the two-phase liquid-rich aqueous fluid inclusions (LC) and sulfides, meanwhile the CC and the LC show a similar Th of 258\u2013313\u00a0\u00b0C and 249\u2013308\u00a0\u00b0C, but different salinities of 1.4\u20135.3\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent and 6.0\u201310.9\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent, respectively. It suggests that dominating fluid immiscibility recorded in QC is responsible for the prime deposition of gold and sulfide minerals. The \u03b418O (-4.1 to \u22126.5\u2030) and \u03b4D (-67.1 to \u221281.3\u2030) values of fluid inclusions in quartz suggest that ore-forming fluids were mainly derived from magmatic water which could related to mantle source. Gold-bearing pyrites yield an Rb-Sr isochron age of 128.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma, which is 8\u00a0m.y. earlier than the peak value of gold mineralization ages (ca. 120\u00a0Ma) at Jiaodong in response to the Early Cretaceous lithospheric thinning of the NCC and the reactivation of the Tan-Lu Fault zone (TLFZ). The Wuhe area shares similar characteristics of geology, fluid inclusions, H-O isotopes, and ore-forming ages with the Jiaodong gold ore cluster, highlighting the exploration potential in this region.\n               ","94":"\n                  Mineral prospectivity mapping is similar to probability prediction using multi-source geological data. However, the complexity of geological phenomena creates difficulties for research. In this study, a deep regression neural network was built to map the mineral prospectivity in the Daqiao Gold Mine in Gansu Province, China. The neural network was trained using multi-source data including geological, geophysical, and geochemical data for the study area. The proposed deep regression neural network reveals the complex relationships between the mineral prospectivity map and geological, geophysical, and geochemical features, improving the prediction results. Moreover, the training dataset does not require classified samples. Training samples with continuous values can help improve the fault tolerance of the training dataset and reduce the uncertainty of positive samples. The experimental results showed that the proposed neural network learned previous expert knowledge related to mineral prospectivity mapping and can be applied to deep regression neural networks to predict and evaluate mineral resources using multiple data sources. The prospectivity map obtained in this study benefits the search for gold mineralization in the study area.\n               ","95":"\n                  In the exploration of sedimentary manganese deposits, prospecting models with large-scale ore-generating geological anomalies are required to satisfy productive demands. This study presents a novel approach combining theories of sedimentary basin analysis with techniques of quantitative analysis of mineral resources for extracting large-scale geological anomalies based on variations of intra-manganese-basin tectonic and sedimentary environments. For this purpose, the Minle sedimentary manganese deposit in Hunan province, China, was taken as a case study. First, the stratigraphic and lithological characteristics were analyzed to divide the region on the scales of manganese basins and mining areas. Subsequently, suitable paleogeographic features were selected as ore-generating geological anomalies and analyzed for three-dimensional quantitative evaluation of mineral resources. Finally, the thicknesses and grades of ore bodies were quantitatively analyzed to summarize the positioning regularities of rich ores. Pre-mineralization tectonic and sedimentary environments were found to be closely related to the distribution of rich ores. Areas suitable for the formation of rich ores were found to be those that feature coarse clastic sedimentation at the edge of the barrier-tidal flat-lagoon system and experienced a shift in the stable transitional environment from the barrier-tidal flat-lagoon to the bay before mineralization. Large-scale sedimentary features, fault activities, structural styles, and evidence of multiple mineralization mechanisms should also be taken into account in the selection of ore-generating geological anomalies.\n               ","96":"\n                  The late Paleozoic Tuwu porphyry Cu deposit is located in the Dananhu\u2013Tousuquan arc in Eastern Tianshan, northwest China. In this study, we present new apatite fission track data of the intermediate-felsic intrusions (i.e., diorite porphyry, tonalite porphyry, quartz porphyry, and quartz albite porphyry) from Tuwu, together with inverse thermal modeling and previous study, to reveal exhumation and cooling history. Apatite fission track length analyses indicate that the track annealing type belongs to a transition from the undisturbed basement distribution to the mixed distribution. As a whole, two phases of cooling were recognized from inverse thermal modeling including a protracted slow cooling period with an average cooling rate of 0.32 \u2103\/Ma during late Cretaceous to Miocene and moderate slow cooling with a cooling rate of 1.89 \u2103\/Ma from Miocene to the present day. The first phase of cooling can be mainly attributed to a tectonically quiet and arid to semiarid climate whereas the later phases of cooling related to structural activation occurred at\u00a0~25\u201315\u00a0Ma in response to a distant effect of the India-Eurasia convergence. In addition, the exhumation rates of Tuwu intrusions from the two stages are 10.7\u00a0m\/Ma and 63\u00a0m\/Ma, respectively. The calculated total exhumation thickness at Tuwu is 1.2\u20132.3\u00a0km since late Cretaceous. Based on the integration of stratigraphic sequence, tectonic setting, paleogeographic, geochronology, and low temperature thermochronology study, we suggest that the thick deposition of coal-bearing stratum during the early and middle Jurassic, the extended duration slow cooling and exhumation controlled by arid to semiarid climate, and the differential lifting movement of fault blocks are key factors for preservation of the early Carboniferous Tuwu Cu deposit.\n               ","97":"\n                  The high grade (~22.5\u00a0g\/t), gold-only Tick Hill deposit presents a unique mineralization style in the Mt Isa Inlier. The deposit was mined in the early 1990s, and is hosted in biotite schist, calc-silicate gneiss, quartzite and quartz-feldspar mylonite. These rocks were affected by D1 shearing and D2 upright folding at high-grade metamorphic conditions, followed by D3 events including normal faulting with widespread quartz-feldspar alteration and D4 strike-slip faulting. The Tick Hill ore body was linear in shape and paralleled the D1 mineral elongation lineation, and the intersection lineation between sets of D3 faults. Gold is dominantly hosted within intensely silicified units affected by D3 fracturing and associated alteration. However, some gold grains are contained within syn-D1, peak-metamorphic minerals indicating that mineralization involved two separate events; an early event predating or concomitant with D1 when gold was first introduced and concentrated, and a second event during D3 when gold was remobilized and\/or further enriched to be deposited in its final configuration. Mineralization at Tick Hill is characterized by coarse grained gold associated with Bi-selenides, minor sulfides, and a general paucity of other metals except for a slight enrichment of Cu in the footwall to the ore zone. Alteration is characterized by early silicification and magnetite alteration that formed during the initial D1-2 events and may have coincided with the first stage of gold enrichment. During syn-D3 (re-)mobilization of gold, alteration involved the destruction of magnetite, the emplacement of abundant laminar quartz veins, and the deposition of proximal albite, hematite, chlorite, amphibole, epidote overprinted by later K-feldspar, sericite, clay minerals and minor calcite. The ore zone is bounded by a strongly silicified zone and surrounded by a chlorite-epidote shell. The low pressure D3 gold (re-)mobilization event involved an oxidized, S-under-saturated, acidic, saline aqueous fluid. In terms of alteration characteristics, the Tick Hill deposit shares similarities with IOCG deposits in the area. However, its high-grade gold-only nature, lack of Cu, and the presence of Bi-selenides makes it a unique deposit in the Mt Isa Inlier.\n               ","98":"\n                  The Dayingezhuang gold deposit in the Jiaodong district, eastern margin of the North China Craton is hosted in Mesozoic granitic rocks and consists of quartz-sulfide veins\/veinlets and sulfide disseminations in alteration envelopes. Previous studies mainly focused on the geochronology, sources of ore-forming fluids and metals to investigate the ore genesis. However, enrichment mechanism of Au and other associated trace metals remain unclear. In this study, we present detailed textures and in-situ LA-ICP-MS trace-element compositions of different generations of pyrite, as well as EMP analysis of Au-bearing minerals to discuss the occurrence and enrichment mechanism of Au at this deposit.\n                  Three generations of pyrite (Py1, Py2 and Py3) formed during three hydrothermal ore stages (I, II, and III) at Dayingezhuang. Py1 occurs as disseminations in sericitic alteration assemblages and is characterized by low Au (mean 0.15\u00a0ppm), Ag, As and Te contents. The time-resolved depth-concentration profiles indicate that Au in Py1 mainly occurs as nanoparticles and\/or micron-sized inclusions. Py2 can be further divided into the early undeformed Py2a and later Py2b, which is the product of deformed Py2a with different degrees of brittle to plastic deformation and recrystallization. Py2a in pyrite-siderite-quartz veins is relatively enriched in invisible Au (mean 0.41\u00a0ppm), Ag, As, and Te compared to Py1, and contains numerous micron-sized Au inclusions. In contrast, Py2b contains lesser invisible Au (0.21\u00a0ppm) and host abundant gold minerals along the grain boundaries and microfractures. Py3 in polymetallic sulfide veins has little Au. As a whole, Au in pyrite is positively correlated with Ag and Te, which is consistent with the results of EMP analysis showing the occurrence of Au as electrum, native gold and minor petzite in pyrite. Such evidences show that the deformation and recrystallization of auriferous Py2a potentially caused local remobilization of Au (mainly as micron-sized inclusion Au) via solid-state ductile flow and subsequent reconcentration of Au in microfractures of Py2b. The pyrite deformation and Au remobilization events were suggested to be related to the continuous reactivation of the regional Zhaoping Fault contemporaneous with gold mineralization. Our study highlights the importance of remobilization and reconcentration of Au triggered by syn-ore tectonic activities at Dayingezhuang and possibly other Au deposits in the Jiaodong district.\n               ","99":"\n                  Effective exploration for ore deposits usually seeks distinct conditions within fundamentally prospective geological settings that might lead to enhanced ore-forming processes. Large-scale metal accumulation to form ore deposits is usually associated with specific tectonic events. Many studies have found that significant mineralization is genetically related to plate subduction and accretion\/collision tectonic regimes. Here we describe how an active continental margin extensional setting can also define an important tectonic environment for the development of a world-class regional metallogenic province subsequent to subduction and compressional stresses. The extensive and diverse group of mineral deposits formed from 145 to 70\u00a0Ma along the eastern Asian continental margin (EACM), from northern Vietnam, through eastern China, Korea, Japan, and to the Sikhote-Alin region of Far East Russia, represents a good example of a regional extension-related metallogenic province. The varied mineral deposits with distinct fluid and metal sources occur in a series of NE- or NNE-trending pull-apart basins and metamorphic core complexes, as well as along associated transtensional faults, reflecting the controls of an extensional regime. A new tectono-metallogenic model for the Cretaceous ore-forming events of eastern Asia is proposed to highlight the exploration potential in such tectonic settings throughout the world.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt, located in southeastern Guizhou Province, is a typical Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic district at the southwestern margin of the Yangtze Craton (Hu et al., 2002) and in the basin margin facies belt (Fig. 6) (Zhou et al., 2020). The Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt is famous for its Hg deposits (points), with proven reserves of >10,000\u00a0t and average mercury grade of 1.50\u00a0%. Subsequently, a series of gold deposits (points) were discovered, including the Hongfachang Hg-Au deposit, the Sixiangchang Hg-Au deposit, and the Paiting Hg-Au deposit. The Paiting Hg-Au deposit is a medium-sized Au deposit (average gold grade of 4.05\u00a0g\u00a0t\u22121) and the largest gold deposit in the Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt (Fig. 1\nB) (Wu, 2008; Xie et al., 2016). Previous studies have shown that the geochemical characteristics of the Paiting Hg-Au deposit are similar to the Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada, USA and the gold deposits in the Youjiang Basin, Guizhou Province (Hu et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002; Xie et al., 2016, Xu et al., 2018). However, the metallogenic characteristics of the Paiting Hg-Au deposit differ from those of the Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada, USA and the gold deposits in the Youjiang Basin, Guizhou Province. Significant differences include the following: (1) the ore-bearing strata are Cambrian; (2) the ore-forming fluids have high salinities (16\u201326\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv) (Chen, 1992); (3) the ore fluid temperature is higher than that of the Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada, USA (Li et al., 2002); (4) abundant calcite veins are common gangue minerals (Li et al., 2019). Previous studies mainly focused on the ore-forming sources and fluids (Li et al., 2002; Kong, 2014; Li et al., 2019). Unfortunately, due to a lack of conclusive constraints on the sources of metals, the genesis of the ore deposit remains controversial. Two opposing viewpoints have been proposed to explain the ore-forming sources: (1) underlying strata (Wang and Shi, 1997; Kong, 2014) versus (2) deep-seated magma (Li et al., 2002).\nAs a global heavy metal pollutant, mercury (Hg) is the only metallic element in the form of gaseous Hg(0) in nature (Pirrone et al., 2009), only when it is in its reduced form. The geochemical cycling of Hg in the Earth's surface reservoirs (e.g., soil, sediments, and atmosphere) has attracted with much interest (Selin, 2009; Balogh et al., 2015; Meng et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019, 2021; Yuan et al., 2021). However, the sources and isotopic compositions of Hg in the lithosphere need much better understood. Briefly, Hg isotope ratios have been used to trace the global mercury circulation (Sun et al., 2018), biochemical reaction (Perrot et al., 2012; Sherman et al., 2013), and identify the mercury pollution sources (Koster van Groos et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2010; Pribil et al., 2010; Sonke et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2013) in the environment.\nHg has seven natural stable isotopes (196Hg, 198Hg, 199Hg, 200Hg, 201Hg, 202Hg, and 204Hg) (Blum and Bergquist, 2007), and can undergo mass-dependent fractionation (MDF, expressed as \u03b4202Hg), mass-independent fractionation (MIF, expressed as \u0394199Hg and \u0394201Hg), and even-mass isotope fractionation (expressed as \u0394200Hg and \u0394204Hg). Hg-MDF has been observed during various processes such as physical (e.g., evaporation, volatilization), chemical (e.g., Hg(II) reduction, ligand exchange, and sorption), and biological processes (e.g., MeHg demethylation, microbial methylation) (Kritee et al., 2007, 2009; Bergquist and Blum, 2009; Laffont et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2020). Hg-MIF in natural samples is mainly produced by Hg photochemical reactions (Bergquist and Blum, 2009; Chen et al., 2012; Blum et al., 2014). Significant Hg-MIF has been observed in the Earth's surface environments (e.g., soil, water, sediment, and atmosphere) and in geological materials (e.g., coal, rock, ores, and black shale) (Smith et al., 2005, 2008; Sun et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2016b; Ogrinc et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2020). Previous study showed Hg in the magmatic\/mantle materials has no Hg-MIF signals (\u0394199Hg \u223c 0\u00a0\u2030) (Sherman et al., 2009), however, a recent study showed significant positive Hg-MIF (0\u00a0\u2030 to 0.4\u00a0\u2030) in magmatic rocks (Deng et al., 2020 and references therein). In addition, epigenetic Hg in sedimentary rocks has been determined to result in Hg-MIF (\u0394199Hg\u00a0\u2260\u00a00\u00a0\u2030) (Yin et al., 2016a). In hydrothermal processes, the leaching of Hg from source rocks seems to cause insignificant Hg-MDF with \u03b4202Hg (< \u00b1 0.5\u00a0\u2030) (Smith et al., 2008), whereas significant Hg-MDF with \u03b4202Hg (>5\u2030) is likely to be caused by the boiling of hydrothermal fluids and redox reactions in hydrothermal systems (Smith et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2008). Briefly, since hydrothermal processes do not produce significant Hg-MIF (Smith et al., 2005, 2008; Sherman et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2019), the \u0394199Hg of hydrothermal ores was mainly inherited from their Hg sources, by which the source of Hg in hydrothermal deposits is possible to be identified.\nIn hydrothermal deposits, Hg is enriched in sulfide minerals (Rytuba, 2003), and cinnabar is the primary host for Hg (Smith et al., 2008; Pribil et al., 2020). Previous studies have documented that Hg isotopes can be used to trace the sources and mineralization processes of Hg and other chalcophile metals (e.g., Ag, Pb, Au, and Sb) in hydrothermal deposits (Smith et al., 2005, 2008; Yin et al., 2016a, 2019; Tang et al., 2017, 2021; Xu et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020, 2021; Liu et al., 2021). In a recent study, Yin et al. (2016a) reported the Hg isotopic compositions of Pb-Zn deposits (sedimentary-exhalative deposits (SEDEX), volcanic hosted massive sulfide deposits (VMS), Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT), and intrusion related deposits (IR)) in China. SEDEX and MVT deposits showed significant Hg-MIF, suggesting Hg was from sedimentary sources. VMS and IR deposits showed insignificant Hg-MIF, indicating that Hg was linked to magmatic sources. Xu et al. (2018), with significant Hg-MIF signatures of sediment-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in the Changdu area, Southwestern China, proposed that the ore-forming metals were mainly derived from the underlying metamorphic basement. Similarly, Fu et al. (2020) reported the Hg-MIF of stibnite and strata in the world's largest Sb deposit and proposed that the ore-forming metals were mainly derived from the Proterozoic metamorphic basement. Yin et al. (2019) investigated the Hg-MIF signatures of the Carlin-type gold deposit (Shuiyindong) in the Youjiang Basin and speculated that the metal was sourced from magma. It is noteworthy that previous studies have reported substantial amounts of Hg isotopic data for various deposits, yet there is still a lack of systematic studies of the isotopic variation of Hg within a single deposit. Hence, it is necessary to conduct a systematic study of the Hg concentrations and isotopic compositions to identify the sources and understand the geochemical process of Hg in ore deposits.\nIn this study, we carried out an integrated investigation of Hg concentrations and isotopic compositions of sulfide minerals (i.e., cinnabar) and the regional underlying strata (including the Cambrian Niutitang Formation black shale and the Neoproterozoic Xiajiang Group Qingshuijiang Formation tuff suggested in previous studies) in the Paiting Hg deposit. The aim of this study is to reevaluate the feasibility of the underlying strata and deep magma, ever proposed, as the sources of Hg deposits in the Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt from the perspective of Hg isotopes, which provides new insight into the ore genesis.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt is located in southeastern Guizhou Province at the juncture of the Yangtze Craton and the Cathaysian fold belt(Fig. 1A) (Chen et al., 2018), containing independent Au, Sb, and Hg deposits (points), as well as Au-Hg and Au-Sb deposits (points) (Fig. 1B) (Xie et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019). The eastern part of Guizhou and the adjacent region (including the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt) have experienced ocean-continental transitions and intraplate activities (Wang et al., 2006; Dai et al., 2008). Oceanic-continental transitions include the Wuling tectonic cycle and the Caledonian tectonic cycle, and intraplate activities include the Yanshanian tectonic cycle and the Himalayan tectonic cycle. The breakup of the Yangtze Craton formed the Yangtze and the Cathaysia Blocks in the Middle Proterozoic (Xie, 2016). The South China Block was formed by collisional amalgamation along the Yangtze-Cathaysia Block continental margins in the Sinian-Early Paleozoic. The Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt was affected by the Pacific continental margin and the Tethys region and experienced intraplate rift and extrusion in the Devonian-Jurassic (Wang et al., 2006; Dai et al., 2008). Previous studies suggested that the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt has experienced multiple-stage tectonic deformation during the Jurassic to Cretaceous (Wang et al., 2006; Dai et al., 2008). These tectonic events, especially the Yanshanian one, have formed complex structures and widespread low-temperature Hg, Au, As, and Sb mineralization in a huge area (Hu et al., 2002; Dai et al., 2008, 2010; Wang and Wen, 2015). The spatial distribution of the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt was controlled by the Baojing-Kaili-Sandu deep fault belt. The distribution of ore deposits was controlled by the Sandu-Danzhai deep fault (Yan et al., 1989; Li et al., 2002) (Fig. 6), and the Hg-Au-Sb deposits (points) were distributed along the NE- striking fault (Fig. 2\nA). According to the geochemical anomalies and structures, the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt is divided into two metallogenic subzones. The eastern metallogenic subzone is characterized by Au-Sb mineralization, which is the Au-dominated deposits in the Paiting-Gaodong-Miaolong metallogenic belt, including the Miaolong and Paihe Au-Sb ore fields and several Au, Au-Sb, and Sb deposits (points). The western metallogenic subzone is characterized by Hg-Au mineralization, which is Hg-dominated deposits in the Hongfachang-Jiaoli-La'e metallogenic belt, including the Jiali and Shuiyinchang Hg-Au ore fields.\nAlthough a wide age range (129\u201365.4\u00a0Ma from various dating methods) has been reported for the Hg-Au-Sb deposits in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt (Li et al., 2002; Wang and Wen, 2015), these ages are mainly clustered around the Yanshanian (Yan et al., 1989). Fluid inclusion studies at Paiting indicated that the ore fluids were enriched in CH4 (4.0\u00a0mol%) and CO2 (1.6\u00a0mol%), moderate temperature (200\u2013290\u00a0\u00b0C) (Li et al., 2002; Xie et al., 2016). The main strata outcrops in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt are the Neoproterozoic, Sinian, Cambrian, Silurian, Ordovician, and Devonian (Fig. 1A). The basement rock outcrops are limestone, dolomite, sandstone, siltstone, and shale, and the oldest rock outcrops are the Neoproterozoic Xiajiang Group, which is composed of metasandstone, slate, and siltstone. The Danzhai district is a deep-water basin in the Cambrian Terreneuvian Jingningian to Meishucun composed of black siliceous rocks and carbonate rocks. The Danzhai district is the shelf-slope facies in the Cambrian Terreneuvian Meishucun to the Cambrian Series 2 Duyun composed of pelite, carbonate rocks, and clastic rocks. The Sandu district is a deep-water basin in the Cambrian Terreneuvian Meishucun to the Cambrian Series 2 Duyun composed of black carbonaceous clay rocks and carbonate rocks. The Sandu district is the slope facies in the Cambrian Series 3 Taijiang to the Cambrian Furongian Niuchehe composed of carbonate rocks, brecciated limestone, and pelite (Shao et al., 1999). The main Hg-bearing strata are the Cambrian in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt (Yan et al., 1989). The central part of the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt is the Yangtze stratigraphic region composed of carbonaceous shale, limestone, and dolomite from lower to upper. The eastern part of Zhushachang-Yangyongguan is a transitional zone composed of carbonaceous shale, siliceous rocks, limestone, and dolomite from lower to upper.\n\n\n2.2\nDeposit geology\nThe Paiting Hg-Au deposit is located in the Hongfachang-Paihe Hg-Au ore fields in the northern section of the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt. The Paiting Hg-Au deposit is a medium-sized Au deposit (average gold grade of 4.05\u00a0g\u00a0t\u22121) and the largest gold deposit in the Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt (Fig. 1B) (Wu, 2008; Xie et al., 2016). The strata exposed in the Paiting Hg-Au deposit are the monocline formation (Fig. 2A) that dip to the west from 15\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 (Fig. 2B). The distribution is controlled by the intersection of the NE-, NWW-, and NEE-striking faults. The ore-hosting structures are the NE-striking faults, minor faults, and X-type shear faults. The orebodies appear in irregular veined, bedded, lenticular, and podiform shapes. The Paiting Hg-Au deposit is mainly controlled by the NNE- and NW-striking faults (i.e., the Wuwan fault and the Xiongqi fault) (Fig. 2A), both of which are regional faults. The Wuwan fault is a reverse fault that dips to the east with a dip of 70\u00b0, which is composed of cataclasite, breccia, and mylonite in the fault zone. The Xiongqi fault is a reverse fault that dips to the east from 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 and is composed of cataclasite and fault gouge in the fault zone. No magmatic rocks are exposed in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt. Alterations associated with Hg mineralization include silicification, calcilization, dolomitization, baratization, and pyritization (Yan et al., 1989; Li et al., 2019). Silicification occurs as the replacement of carbonate and the regeneration of terrestrial quartz. Dolomitization is characterized by the recrystallization or formation of dolomite veins.\nThe main strata exposed in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt are the Upper Proterozoic and Paleozoic Sinian Dengying Formation (Pt3Z2\ndy), Cambrian Series 2 Jiumenchong Formation (\u04042\njm), Bianmachong Formation (\u04042\nb) and Wuxun Formation (\u04042\nw), Cambrian Series 2 and 3 Kaili Formation (\u04042-3\nk), Cambrian Series 3 Shilengshui Formation (\u04043\nsh), and Quaternary (Q). The Au mineralization is mainly hosted in the Cambrian Bianmachong (\u04042\nb), Wuxun (\u04042\nw), and Kaili (\u04042-3\nk) formations. The Series 2 Cambrian Bianmachong Formation (\u04042\nb) is subdivided into lower and upper sections. The lower section is dominated by black silty mudstone, and the upper section consists of grayish-black carbonaceous shale. The Series 2 Cambrian Wuxun Formation (\u04042\nw) is lithologically subdivided into the lower and upper sections. The lower section is dominated by gray to dark sandy mudstone and clay rocks, locally containing dolomitic nodules, with a total thickness of 65\u00a0m\u00a0\u223c\u00a0120\u00a0m. The upper section is mainly composed of light gray to dark gray mudstone and silty mudstone, interbedded with limestone and banded muddy limestone, with a total thickness of 205\u00a0m\u00a0\u223c\u00a0243\u00a0m. The Series 2 and 3 Cambrian Kaili Formation (\u04042-3\nk) is subdivided by lithology into the lower, middle, and upper sections. The lower section is dominated by gray to dark gray mudstone, interbedded with argillaceous limestone, with horizontal stratification, locally containing convolute stratification at the base and gray mudstone and silty mudstone interbedded with dark gray mudstone at the top, with a total thickness of 247\u00a0m\u2013278\u00a0m. The middle section is comprised of light gray to gray dolomite interbedded with oolitic dolomite at the base and gray to dark gray dolorudite at the top, with a total thickness of 48\u00a0m\u2013156\u00a0m. The middle section is dominated by dark gray muddy dolomite containing pyrite nodules at the base and gray banded limestone and bedded muddy limestone, locally containing limestone lenses at the top, with a total thickness of 140\u00a0m\u2013173\u00a0m.\nThe mineralogical compositions of samples were determined by optical microscopy and Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA; backscattered-electron (BSE) imaging) at Guizhou University and the Xi'an Center of Geological Survey, Geology Survey, respectively. The measurement methods and instrument details were described previously by Xu et al. (2021). Ore minerals include cinnabar and pyrite (Fig. 3\nh, i), and minor arsenopyrite (Fig. 3g), whilst the gangue minerals include mainly calcite (Fig. 3a\u2013f). The field observations show the ore structures include disseminated (Fig. 3a, c) and vein (Fig. 3b). Under the microscope, the textures of cinnabar are granular (Fig. 3g\u2013i) and disseminated (Fig. 3e, f). One generation of cinnabar is identified based on the texture. Xenomorphic granular pyrite is the late-stage mineral of gold mineralization in the Paiting Hg-Au deposit (Xie et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019). Cinnabar is intergrown with calcite and disseminated in calcite veins (Fig. 3b, f). Pyrite and arsenopyrite are disseminated around cinnabar (Fig. 3g, i). The calcite vein crosscut by the calcite vein (Fig. 3c) and cinnabar is disseminated in the calcite vein (Fig. 3d\u2013f), indicating calcite formed before cinnabar, and the early calcite vein crosscut by the late calcite vein. Alteration associated with Hg mineralization includes mainly carbonatization (Li et al., 2019). Carbonization is characterized by calcite veins filling the fault zones.\n\n\n\n3\nSamples and methods\n\n3.1\nSample collection and preparation\nIn total, eighteen samples, including five Hg ore samples (DZP01\u2013DZP05), three black shale samples (KY01\u2013KY03), and ten tuff samples (PQ01\u2013PQ03, DD01\u2013DD04, RJ01\u2013RJ03), were collected from the selected deposit and exposed basement rocks. Because the Hg deposit had ceased to be exploited, five ore samples were collected from the ore dump. The basement rocks included the Neoproterozoic Xiajiang Group Qingshuijiang Formation tuff and the Cambrian Niutitang Formation black shale. The sample location of these rocks is shown in Fig. 2C. The sample weight ranged from 2\u00a0kg to 4\u00a0kg. The samples were cleaned with deionized water, dried at room temperature, and powdered to 200 mesh before chemical analysis.\n\n\n3.2\nElemental concentration measurement\nThe total Hg (THg) concentrations of the samples were measured at the State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using the Milestone tri-cell Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80, Italy). In addition, blanks and measurements of standard reference soil materials (GSS-4, 590\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u22121) were analyzed after every ten samples, showing recoveries of 90\u2013110\u00a0%. The coefficients of variation for triplicate analyses were\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0%.\n\n\n3.3\nMercury isotope composition measurement\nAll samples were processed in a double stage tube furnace using trapping solutions (40\u00a0% mixture of \u201creverse aqua regia\u201d HNO3\/HCl\u00a0=\u00a02\/1, v\/v) for Hg enrichment to ensure concentrations of 5\u201310\u00a0ng Hg in each sample (Wang et al., 2021). The Hg was diluted in 10\u00a0mL solution (40\u00a0% mixture of \u201creverse aqua regia\u201d) and measured by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS, Tekran 2500, Canada) using the US-EPA method (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2002). The Hg isotope compositions for the samples were measured using the multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS, Neptune II, Thermo Scientific, USA) at the State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, following the standard-sample-standard protocol and bracketing with a NIST SRM 3133 Hg solution as an external standard-sample. The details of the measurement methods and instruments have been described by Wang et al. (2019).\nFollowing Blum and Bergquist (2007), Hg-MDF is reported as \u03b4202Hg notation in per mil (\u2030) referenced to the NIST-3133 Hg standard:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n202\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\u2030\n\n\n=\n\n[\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n202\n\n\nH\ng\n\/\n\n\n\n\n\n198\n\n\nH\n\n\ng\n\n\nsample\n\n\n)\n\n\/\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n202\n\n\nH\ng\n\/\n\n\n\n\n\n198\n\n\nH\n\n\ng\n\n\nNIST\n\nS\nR\nM\n\n3133\n\n\n)\n\n-\n1\n]\n\n\u00d7\n1000\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MIF is reported in \u0394xxxHg notation in unit of per mil (\u2030), is calculated following the convention:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n199\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\u2030\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n199\n\n\nH\ng\n-\n0.2520\n\u00d7\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n202\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n200\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\u2030\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n200\n\n\nH\ng\n-\n0.5024\n\u00d7\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n202\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n201\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\u2030\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n201\n\n\nH\ng\n-\n0.7520\n\u00d7\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n202\n\n\nH\ng\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UM-Almad\u00e9n standard solution was also measured during measurement as a secondary standard. The results of UM-Almad\u00e9n (\u03b4202Hg\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0\u2030, \u0394199Hg=\u00a0\u22120.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0\u2030, \u0394200Hg\u00a0=\u00a00.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0\u2030, \u0394201Hg=\u00a0\u22120.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0\u2030, 2SD, n\u00a0=\u00a03) are consistent with previous study (Blum and Bergquist, 2007).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nHg concentrations\nThe THg concentrations of the basement rocks and Hg ores samples are listed in Table 1\n. The Neoproterozoic basement tuff in Pingqiu (Jinping) shows low THg concentrations of 0.01\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 to 0.11\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 (with an average of 0.07\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121). In contrast, the Neoproterozoic basement tuff in Dadi (Leishan) and Rongjiang shows elevated THg concentrations of 2.36\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 to 3.80\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 (with an average of 4.30\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121) and 0.18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 to 17.87\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 (with an average of 7.91\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121), respectively. The Cambrian black shale concentrations in Kaiyang are 1.52\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 to 4.99\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 (with an average of 3.08\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121). Distinctly, Hg ore samples display enriched THg concentrations, ranging from 568000\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 to 1286000\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 (with an average of 896800.00\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121).\n\n\n4.2\nHg isotopic compositions\nThe Hg isotopic compositions in the basement rocks and Hg ores are also listed in Table 1. The Hg ore samples show large variations of \u03b4202Hg (\u22120.62\u00a0\u2030 to 1.05\u00a0\u2030, mean of 0.33\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.73\u00a0\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a05, SD) and slight positive \u0394199Hg (0.03\u00a0\u2030 to 0.22\u00a0\u2030, mean of 0.08\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.08\u00a0\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a05, SD). The black shale samples have resulted in distinctly negative \u03b4202Hg values of \u20131.55\u00a0\u2030 to \u20130.77\u00a0\u2030 (mean of \u20131.29\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.45\u00a0\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a03, SD) and near zero \u0394199Hg values of \u20130.02\u00a0\u2030 to 0.08\u00a0\u2030 (mean of 0.03\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u00a0\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a03, SD). The three tuff samples show consistent Hg isotopic signatures, with negative \u03b4202Hg values (mean of\u00a0\u22120.32\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.81\u00a0\u2030 for Pingqiu, mean of\u00a0\u22120.45\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.13\u00a0\u2030 for Dadi, and mean of\u00a0\u22120.46\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.15\u00a0\u2030 for Rongjiang, n\u00a0=\u00a03, SD) and negligible \u0394199Hg values (mean of\u00a0\u22120.02\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u00a0\u2030 for Pingqiu, mean of\u00a0\u22120.02\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.02\u00a0\u2030 for Dadi, and mean of\u00a0\u22120.03\u00a0\u2030, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a00.03\u00a0\u2030 for Rongjiang, n\u00a0=\u00a03, SD). In addition, the slope of \u0394199Hg\/\u0394201Hg is 1.0 (Fig. 5\n\n\n), however, no discernable correlation trends are observed between \u0394199Hg and \u03b4202Hg (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nHg isotope ratio constraints on the sources of ore metals\nThe Hg-bearing mineral (i.e., cinnabar) was observed (Fig. 3a\u2013f) in the hand specimens and under the microscope. High concentrations of Hg in cinnabar have been reported in the Wanshan mercury mining area (2400\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121\u201311700\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121, Yin et al., 2013). Cinnabar has the highest THg concentrations (Table 1; with an average of 896800.00\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121), indicating cinnabar is the major host of Hg in the Paiting Hg deposit.\nHg-MIF in natural samples (e.g., rain water, soils) mainly occurs during photoreduction in the Earth's surface environment (Sonke, 2011; Blum et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2016b). Given no Hg-MIF occurs during the hydrothermal leaching of Hg (Smith et al., 2005, 2008; Tang et al., 2017), Hg-MIF can be a useful tracer to determine Hg sources in hydrothermal deposits (Yin et al., 2016a; Fu et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2021). The \u0394199Hg values of the black shale samples differed in different areas. Yin et al. (2016b) reported the black shale Hg isotopes from two mine sites in the Maoshi polymetallic unit (\u0394199Hg values of 0.10\u00a0\u2030\u20130.22\u00a0\u2030) and the Zhijin phosphorite deposit (\u0394199Hg values of \u20130.01\u00a0\u2030 to 0.22\u00a0\u2030) in Guizhou, SW China. In contrast, the black shale from the Sanhui polymetallic unit had \u0394199Hg values of \u20130.06\u00a0\u2030 to 0.18\u00a0\u2030 (Xue et al., 2022). Similarly, Zhu et al. (2021) reported Hg-MIF with \u0394199Hg (range from \u20130.18\u00a0\u2030 to 0.21\u00a0\u2030, averaging value of 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0\u2030) in the Cambrian Niutitang Formation black shale. As shown in Table 1, the tuff, black shale, and sulfide mineral samples in the Paiting Hg deposit show a \u0394199Hg\/\u0394201Hg slope of 1.0, indicating that Hg-MIF was mainly derived from aqueous Hg(II) photo-reduction processes (Bergquist and Blum, 2007). In addition, Smith et al. (2008) and Sherman et al. (2009) reported that the mantle and volcanic materials had insignificant Hg-MIF with \u0394199Hg (\u223c0\u2030), whereas Zhu et al. (2020) obtained values of 0.02\u00a0\u2030\u20130.10\u00a0\u2030. Moynier et al. (2020) and Sherman et al. (2009) found that basalt samples and sea-floor hydrothermal chimneys had \u03b4202Hg values of\u00a0\u22123.08\u00a0\u2030 to \u20132.08\u00a0\u2030 and 0.31\u00a0\u2030 to\u00a0\u22120.01\u00a0\u2030, and \u0394199Hg values of\u00a0\u22120.03\u00a0\u2030 to 0.04\u00a0\u2030 and 0.00\u00a0\u2030 to 0.04\u00a0\u2030, respectively. Smith et al. (2008) reported no Hg-MIF signatures in mantle materials were absent, and the near-zero Hg-MIF values (\u0394199Hg:\u00a0\u22120.07\u00a0\u2030 to 0.00\u00a0\u2030) in tuff in this study suggest that Hg was mainly derived from the mantle. In addition, our sulfide mineral samples show positive Hg-MIF signals with \u0394199Hg (0.03\u00a0\u2030\u20130.22\u00a0\u2030, average of 0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0\u2030), differing from that of tuff and suggesting that the Cambrian basement black shale was the dominant contributor to Hg in the Hg deposit. Previous studies indicated that basement rocks might be an important source of metals for the Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt (Kong, 2014; Sun et al., 2016). This conclusion is supported by the following additional evidence: (1) the Cambrian black shale and sulfide mineral samples show comparable \u0394199Hg signatures; (2) the Niutitang Cambrian black shale samples are enriched in Hg (10.9\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121\u201320.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121, Yin et al., 2016b). Therefore, the similar Hg-MIF signals of the black shale and sulfide mineral suggest that the Hg in the Hg deposit was likely contributed by the black shale rather than the tuff (Fig. 4).\nThe Hg deposit shows overall heavier Hg isotope compositions (\u03b4202Hg\u00a0=\u00a00.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73\u00a0\u2030) than the tuff (\u03b4202Hg =\u00a0\u22120.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40\u00a0\u2030) and black shale (\u03b4202Hg =\u00a0\u22121.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45\u00a0\u2030) (Table 1), suggesting that Hg might have been fractionated by different mechanisms. In hydrothermal systems, significant Hg-MDF can occur during leaching, redox reactions, fluid boiling, and mineral precipitation (Zheng et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2008; Sherman et al., 2009). Due to leaching of Hg from the source rocks, the MDF values (< \u00b1 0.5\u00a0\u2030) (Smith et al., 2008) are lower than the values of \u03b4202Hg in sulfide mineral in this study, suggesting the Hg-MDF in the Hg ores was not caused by leaching of Hg from source rocks. Smith et al., 2005, Smith et al., 2008) found that the boiling of hydrothermal fluid and redox reaction, associated with Hg(0) evaporation caused a large Hg-MDF (>5\u2030 in \u03b4202Hg). These values are higher than those of \u03b4202Hg in sulfide mineral in this study. In addition, Gray et al. (2013) conducted laboratory retorting experiments of cinnabar, showing that Hg(0) vaporization could result in Hg enrichment with isotopically lighter Hg (Zheng et al., 2007; Gray et al., 2013), thus Hg-MDF may have occurred within the ore bodies (Fu et al., 2020). Fluid inclusion data indicated a lack of evidence for boiling during sulfide formation in the Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt (Li et al., 2002). The aqueous fluid inclusions contained more H2O and CO2 components and were homogenized to liquid upon heating. Thus, we propose that the variation in \u03b4202Hg in the sulfide mineral was not caused by the boiling of hydrothermal fluids. The sulfides of the Paiting Hg deposit show overall heavier Hg isotope compositions (\u03b4202Hg of\u00a0\u22120.62\u00a0\u2030 to 1.05\u00a0\u2030, mean\u00a0=\u00a00.33\u00a0\u2030) (Table 1). However, the sulfides of the Wanshan Hg deposit show overall lighter Hg isotope compositions (\u03b4202Hg of\u00a0\u22120.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a013) (Yin et al., 2013). COS isotopic data suggested the gold mineralization was dominated by deep hydrothermal fluids, whereas the Hg mineralization was dominated by basin fluids (Li et al., 2019). In addition, the significant Hg-MDF signatures are the result of Hg kinetic effects associated with sulfide precipitation processes (Smith et al., 2005, Smith et al., 2008). Tang et al. (2017) reported sulfide samples (\u03b4202Hg of\u00a0\u22123.17\u00a0\u2030 to\u00a0\u22121.59\u00a0\u2030) from the early stage of mineralization were enriched with light mercury isotopes than sulfide samples (\u03b4202Hg of\u00a0\u22121.84\u00a0\u2030 to\u00a0\u22120.57\u00a0\u2030) from the later stage of mineralization. In addition, Xu et al. (2018) reported similar results for sulfides at different mineralization stages in the Lanuoma sediment-hosted Pb-Zn deposits. However, only one mineralization stage of Hg is identified in the Paiting Hg deposit. Smith et al. (2015) demonstrated experimentally that the significant Hg-MDF signatures were caused by between sulfide precipitation and solutions. Both metacinnabar (\u03b2-HgS) and montroydite (HgO) with continuing precipitation result in the enrichment in heavy isotopes (Smith et al., 2015). The significant differences in \u03b4202Hg between the sulfide minerals may be caused by precipitation processes. However, the exact isotope fractionation mechanisms of Hg-MDF during Hg mineralization are difficult to quantify and identify with our data, and more studies are needed.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for ore genesis\n\nXie et al. (2016) reported that the ore fluids of the gold deposits in Guizhou Province were CO2-rich (7\u00a0\u221275\u00a0mol% at Jinfeng (Zhang et al., 2003); 6.3\u00a0\u22128.4\u00a0mol% at Shuiyindong (Su et al., 2009); 1.6\u00a0mol% at Paiting (Li et al., 2002)) and higher temperature (240\u00a0\u2212300\u00a0\u00b0C at Jinfeng (Zhang et al., 2003); 190\u00a0\u2212230\u00a0\u00b0C at Shuiyindong (Su et al., 2009); 200\u00a0\u2212290\u00a0\u00b0C at Paiting (Li et al., 2002)) than those of the Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada, USA. Alterations in the Paiting Au deposit included silicification, sericitization, carbonation, and baratization (Li et al., 2019) and were significantly different from the typical Carlin-type gold mineralization, indicating the unique genesis of Au deposits in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt. Such the salinity of the Paiting Au deposit (16\u00a0\u221226\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv) (Chen, 1992) is higher than that of the gold deposit in the Youjiang Basin, Guizhou Province (0.9\u00a0\u22122.3\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv at Shuiyindong (Su et al., 2009); < 5\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv at Jinfeng (Zhang et al., 2003)) and the Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada, USA (<5\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv) (Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Cline et al., 2005). The characteristics of typical orogenic gold deposits include mesothermal deposit (250\u00a0\u2212400 \u2103), depths of 2\u00a0\u221220\u00a0km, pressure of\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0\u22124 kba, and salinity\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u22128\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Goldfarb et al., 2005). According to the comparison of the pressure\u2013temperature-chemistry conditions of the gold deposits in Guizhou Province, Nevada, and the orogenic belt, Xie et al. (2016) found that the Au deposit in Paiting was similar to both the typical Carlin-type gold deposits and the orogenic gold deposits, which formed at the pressure\u2013temperature-chemistry conditions intermediate to the typical Carlin-type gold deposits and the orogenic gold deposits.\nCHO isotopic data suggested that the ore fluids in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt were dominated by meteoric water (Kong, 2014). Previous study found that the ore fluids were mixed fluids (Xu et al., 2018). The content of Hg in the Cambrian ore-bearing strata is low (0.46\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0\u22121.04\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121) (Yan et al., 1989), thus it is unlikely that this is the source of Hg. In addition, the contents of Hg in the platform margin slope facies (0.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0\u22121.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121) are higher than those in the basin facies (0.09\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0\u22120.39\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121) (Yan et al., 1989). Hg deposits are controlled by the platform margin slope facies in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt (Yan et al., 1989). Previous studies found that the ore-bearing strata in the Danzhai-Sandu metallogenic belt are rich in organic matter, which adsorbs metallogenic elements (e.g., Au, Hg, Sb, and As) (Chen, 1992; Kong, 2014). Chen (1992) found that organic matter in the Danzhai-Sandu metallogenic belt was homologous to the metallogenic elements, indicating it was derived from the Cambrian black shale. In addition, regional geochemical characteristics suggest that metallogenic element (Hg) were mainly derived from the Cambrian black shale (Huang and Du, 1993). The Hg concentration in the Niutitang Cambrian black shale (10.9\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121\u201320.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121) (Yin et al., 2016b) is higher than that of the tuff in this study. The positive \u0394199Hg signals (0.03\u00a0\u2030\u20130.22\u00a0\u2030) of the sulfide mineral samples are similar to the \u0394199Hg signals (\u22120.02\u00a0\u2030 to 0.08\u00a0\u2030) of Cambrian black shale and different from that of tuff (\u22120.07\u00a0\u2030 to 0.00\u00a0\u2030) in this study, indicating that the Cambrian basement black shale was the main contributor to Hg in the Paiting Hg deposit. Using evidence from previous studies as well as Hg concentrations and Hg isotope compositions from this study suggested that Hg transported by the ore-forming fluids may have been mainly derived from the underlying Cambrian Niutitang Formation black shale (Fig. 7\n). Furthermore, the Nanhua Basin is an intracontinental marine basin that was separated by paleo-uplift and formed the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi sub-basin, Jiangnan sub-basin, and Northern Zhejiang sub-basin at the western and northern margins of the Yangtze Block (Jiang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014). The Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian paleogeographic reconstruction reveals the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt was located in the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangzi sub-basin (Jiang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2018). Gao et al. (1997) suggested that the paleotectonic-hydrothermal circulation system was controlled by the paleostructure activities of sedimentary basins and lithofacies and was crucial for the initial enrichment of ore-forming elements in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt. Previous studies suggested that the Yanshanian tectonic activities formed the complex structures and widespread Hg, Au, and Sb mineralization in the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt (Yan et al., 1989; Li et al., 2002; Wang and Wen, 2015). The Paiting Hg-Au deposit is located in the first structural unit (Dai et al., 2008), and the orebodies are controlled by the Sandu-Danzhai deep fault, which is the boundary fault in the Jiangnan orogenic belt (Fig. 6). Large deep fault activities formed the fault zones, which were the main pathways of fluid migration (Gao et al., 1997; Li et al., 2002). Previous studies suggested that the Sandu-Danzhai metallogenic belt had experienced multi-stage mineralization. The first ore stage is Au mineralization of the deep hydrothermal fluid, and the second ore stage is Hg mineralization of the basin fluids (Fan, 2010; Xie et al., 2014; Li et al., 2019). In addition, mercury isotopes can also be used to identify the source of metals in gold deposits. Yin et al. (2019) found that Hg-MIF signatures (\u0394199Hg: \u2212 0.1 to 0.1\u00a0\u2030) of Carlin-type gold deposits was similar to magmatic rocks, indicating that the main source of Hg was magma. Deng et al. (2022) found that the Carlin type gold deposits in southwest China was the intracontinental hydrothermal system by using Hg isotopes evidence. Deng et al. (2020) found that Hg-MIF (\u0394199Hg: 0.11\u00a0\u2030 \u00b1 0.07\u00a0\u2030) of volcanic-arc-associated epithermal gold deposits in northeast China were consistent with marine sediments. Li et al. (2019) found that gold mineralization occurred in the deep section and mercury-antimony mineralization in the shallow section in the Paiting Hg-Au deposit, indicating that gold mineralization occurred earlier than mercury-antimony mineralization, and the mineralization horizons were different in the mineralization stages (Li et al., 2002). Gold mineralization preferentially occurs in banded limestone and siltstone (Kong, 2014; Xie et al., 2016). Hg mineralization occurs in micrite and calcirudite (Kong, 2014). Ore minerals involved in gold mineralization include arsenopyrite, pyrite, stibnite, and sphalerite. The gangue minerals include quartz, ferroan dolomite, calcite, and fluorite (Xie et al., 2014, 2016; Li et al., 2019). The ore minerals of the Hg mineralization include cinnabar and pyrite (Fig. 3h-i), and minor arsenopyrite (Fig. 3g), whilst the gangue minerals include mainly calcite (Fig. 3a\u2013f). Arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite are the main gold-bearing minerals. Gold is invisible as solid solution (Au+) and resides in the zoned arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite (Xie et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019). Cinnabar is the main Hg-bearing mineral. Alterations associated with gold mineralization include silicification, pyritization, and arsenopyrite mineralization (Li et al., 2002; Xie et al., 2016). Alteration associated with Hg mineralization includes mainly carbonatization (Li et al., 2019). We hypothesize that the Yanshanian tectonic activities promoted the migration and mobilization of deep hydrothermal fluids in this region, carrying enriched Au and associated elements (e.g., Fe and As) in deep-seated plutons. The ore-forming fluids migrated in a suitable metallogenic environment (i.e., the Cambrian carbonate rocks) along the fault zones, followed by Au precipitation to form Au deposits. The deep hydrothermal fluids promoted Hg mobilization in Hg-bearing formation (i.e., the Cambrian Niutitang Formation black shale) in the paleo-basin sedimentary strata to form Hg-enriched fluids. During mineralization, the Hg-enriched fluids flowed and permeated from the lower to the upper strata, which were transported to the platform margin slope facies along the faults, followed by Hg precipitation to form Hg deposits.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nFor the Paiting Hg deposit, our study showed that the comparison of Hg isotopes between basement rocks and Hg ores can contribute to identifying the Hg source. Compared with previous studies, the Hg isotopes constrained the source of Hg in the Hg deposits. This study revealed the \u0394199Hg and \u03b4202Hg signatures in the Paiting Hg deposit in the Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Au-Sb metallogenic belt. Hg-MIF with positive \u0394199Hg signatures of sulfide mineral indicated that Hg was likely to be inherited from the basement Cambrian black shale, which showed similar Hg-MIF signatures. Hence, Hg isotopes can be used as a geochemical tracer of metal sources and provide new insights. Our results suggest that the underlying basement rocks may be an important source of Hg for the sediment-hosted Hg deposits.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1812402, 41962008), the project of the scientific and technological innovation team of sedimentary deposits in Guizhou Province (No. 2018-5613), the Cultivation Project of Guizhou University (No. 202007), and the open foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (No. 201905).\n\n","1":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nUltramafic-hosted magnesite deposits originate from the interaction between CO2-bearing fluids and ultramafic rocks. CO2 in aqueous fluids, dissolved as CO3\n2\u2013 under relatively high pH, reacts with Mg2+ derived from silicate minerals, such as serpentine, and becomes bonded in the crystal structure of newly formed magnesite (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992; Pohl, 1990). There is a distinction between vein and massive magnesite deposits (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992). Vein-type magnesite deposits, also known in the literature as Kraubath-type (Redlich, 1909), are constituted by magnesite lodes and stockworks in altered serpentinite. Their textural and mineralogical features, such as mineralisation in open vugs, presence of clay minerals, and opal-CT, indicate a shallow depth of formation (\u223c <1 km) and relatively low temperatures (\u223c <200 \u00b0C) (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992; Fallick et al., 1991; Jurkovi\u0107 et al., 2012; Pohl, 1990; Zedef et al., 2000). In massive magnesite deposits, also called listvenite (Halls and Zhao, 1995), ultramafic rocks are transformed into an assemblage of magnesite, quartz, talc, muscovite or chlorite indicating greater depths (\u223c0.3 to \u223c1.4 GPa) and higher temperatures (\u223c200 - \u223c400 \u00b0C) of formation (de Obeso et al., 2022; Menzel et al., 2018; Robinson et al., 2005; Schandl and Naldrett, 1992). Their association with economic concentrations of gold, mercury, and occasionally base metals, motivated the study of these deposits in the past, whereas, since mineral carbonation has been recognised as an option for the storage of anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Lackner et al., 1995; Seifritz, 1990), they began to be studied as natural analogues for the storage of CO2 through mineral carbonation (Beinlich et al., 2012; Boschi et al., 2020, 2017, 2009; Hansen et al., 2005; Matter and Kelemen, 2009; Oskierski et al., 2013; Power et al., 2013; Rielli et al., 2021; Ulrich et al., 2014). From an applicative perspective, the preservation of magnesite deposits in the geologic record testifies that in these systems optimal conditions were reached for CO2 to be trapped through mineral carbonation and stored in the form of stable carbonates for millions of years (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992; Boschi et al., 2009; Mirnejad et al., 2008).\nUnderstanding the mechanisms that drove their formation can thus help engineer more efficient CO2 storage solutions and predict the behaviour of ultramafic massifs when injected with CO2.\nHere, amongst the ultramafic-hosted magnesite deposits, we focus on the vein-type, because being formed at shallow crustal levels and relatively low temperatures they best represent the conditions at which mineral carbonation can be applied either in in-situ or ex-situ engineered solutions (Kelemen et al., 2011; Sanna et al., 2013; Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2020).\nThe proposed genetic models for this type of deposit are polarised amongst two dominant views that see magnesite formation either as a supergene or epithermal process (Pohl 1990 and references therein). Supergene models propose the weathering of surficial ultramafics by percolating meteoric water which leaches Mg2+ and precipitates magnesite in the underlying bedrock (Kelemen et al., 2011; Pohl, 1990; Quesnel et al., 2013). This view is validated by the C-O isotopic composition of magnesite from some deposits which is consistent with a surficial (soil\/atmosphere) origin of the CO2 (Andrews et al., 2018; Gartzos, 2004; Jedrysek and Halas, 1990; Jurkovi\u0107 et al., 2012; Kelemen et al., 2011; Kralik et al., 1989; Oskierski et al., 2013; Quesnel et al., 2013; Zedef et al., 2000).\nEpithermal models instead propose that heated CO2-rich fluids interacting with ultramafics become enriched in Mg2+ and precipitate magnesite in open fractures (Pohl, 1990). Isotope geochemistry also supports this view, with a series of deposits where the C-O isotopic composition of magnesite indicates the derivation of CO2 from the decarbonation of deep limestone sequences (Barnes et al., 1973; Fallick et al., 1991; Zedef et al., 2000) or from the Earth\u2019s mantle (Boskabadi et al., 2017; Stern and Gwinn, 1990; Wickham et al., 1994).\nFollowing these two contrasting views, the role of tectonics is also debated. In supergene models even though carbonation is generally seen as a post-tectonic process, taking place in absence of significant tectonic activity, such as in the Samail ophiolite of Oman (e.g., Kelemen et al., 2011; Matter and Kelemen, 2009), there are syn-tectonic examples that show a key role of tectonics in providing the permeability required for meteoric water to infiltrate into the underlying ultramafics, such as in the Koniabo massif of New Caledonia (Quesnel et al., 2013).\nIn epithermal models instead, even if magnesite mineralisation is considered a syn-tectonic process, mainly because of the presence of stockwork veins, brecciation and the opening of meter-tick fractures hosting magnesite, the specific role of tectonics in the carbonation process is yet to be understood (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992; Pohl, 1990). A continuum between supergene and epithermal processes has also been proposed from the study of magnesite deposits in the Great Serpentinite belt of Australia, where supergene deposits formed systematically onto deeper epithermal carbonation systems (Oskierski et al., 2013).\nHere we merge a petrologic and isotopic study with structural and field observations at the Castiglioncello magnesite deposit hosted in the Ligurian ophiolites of central Tuscany (Italy), to further constrain the role of tectonics and the source of CO2 in the genesis of ultramafic-hosted vein-type magnesite deposits.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThe Castiglioncello magnesite deposit is located in the inner portion of the Northern Apennine, a fold-and-thrust belt generated by the westward subduction of the Adria plate underneath the European plate, thought to begin as early as the middle Eocene (\u223c40\u00a0Ma; Carminati et al., 2012 and references therein). During the compressional phase, oceanic units, represented by Jurassic oceanic crust and its sedimentary cover (Ligurian Units), were overthrusted onto a sedimentary succession developed on the Adria continental margin (Tuscan Nappe, Fig. 1\n; Carmignani et al., 1994). After nappe stacking, the rollback of the subducted slab drove the eastward migration of the compressional front (Carmignani et al., 1994; Jolivet et al., 1998). Starting from the early-middle Miocene this produced extension in the inner portion of the chain (i.e., northern Tyrrhenian Sea and Tuscany; Carmignani et al., 1994; Jolivet et al., 1998). Even if extension was a continuous process, two main stages have been identified. The first occurred during the Miocene and produced mainly eastward-dipping low-angle normal faults (Brogi and Liotta, 2008; Carmignani et al., 1994). This generated an extension of at least 120% (Brogi, 2006; Carmignani et al., 1994) producing the lateral segmentation of the more competent levels in the tectonic pile (Brogi and Liotta, 2008) and the formation of tectonic depressions, that were then filled by Miocene sedimentation. The second stage, active since the Pliocene, produced NW-striking normal faults cutting all the previous structures (Brogi, 2004) with estimated extension of about 6\u20137% (Carmignani et al., 1994). The latter event enhanced the geometry of earlier Miocene basins triggering the sedimentation of thick Pliocene-Pleistocene marine and continental sedimentary sequences (Liotta, 1996). Extension was coeval with the activity of sub-vertical, orogen-perpendicular NE-trending transfer zones, especially in central and southern Tuscany (Ghelardoni, 1965; Liotta, 1991). These are considered lithospheric tear faults developed in response of along-strike variations in the rate of slab rollback (Rosenbaum and Piana Agostinetti, 2015) and acted as pathways for magmas and controlled the distribution of hydrothermal systems (i.e., first-order structures; Fig. 1; Acocella and Funiciello, 2006; Dini et al., 2008; Liotta and Brogi, 2020). These were associated with second-order structures controlling only deformation at shallower crustal levels (Liotta, 1991; Liotta and Brogi, 2020). Kinematic indicators along these structures provide contrasting indications: while most of the displacement was left-lateral, evidence for right-lateral and even normal movement have been reported (Brogi et al., 2011, 2010; Liotta and Brogi, 2020). The net effect was the diffuse dissection of the entire tectonic pile creating a transient sub-vertical crustal permeability connected with the sub-horizontal permeability (thrusts, low-angle, and high-angle normal faults, lithological contrasts) of the shallow crust.\nOverall, extensional tectonics produced crustal thinning, reaching \u223c22\u00a0km in Central-Southern Tuscany, and rising of the asthenosphere (Calcagnile and Panza, 1981). This was associated with a prolonged magmatic activity that in Southern Tuscany produced intense hydrothermal circulation documented by both fossil (ore deposits) and active (geothermal fields) systems (Brogi et al., 2020; Dini, 2022, 2003; Dini et al., 2005; Rimondi et al., 2016). The portion of the Italian peninsula affected by extensional tectonics, mainly in the regions of Tuscany, Campania, and Latium, today records anomalous non-volcanic diffuse CO2 emissions which are estimated at \u223c10 Mt\/yr (Chiodini et al., 2004; Frondini et al., 2019).\n\n2.1\nGeological setting of Monti Livornesi\nThe Monti Livornesi are a structural high constituted mainly by Ligurian Units (Fig. 2\n) delimited to the North and to the South by two first-order, regional-scale NE-trending transfer zones: the Livorno-Sillaro and the Rosignano \u2013 Pomaia respectively (Ghelardoni, 1965; Fig. 2). The Livorno-Sillaro transfer zone is the most prominent orogen-perpendicular structure in the northern Apennine and, although strike-slip kinematic is ambiguous, it has been considered as a dominant sinistral strike-slip system active since the Miocene (Rosenbaum and Piana Agostinetti, 2015 and references therein). The Rosignano - Pomaia is marked by several NE-trending faults in the Rosignano-Val di Perga area and by the sharp southern termination of the Neogene Fine Basin (Fig. 2). Several other minor NE-trending structures crosscut the Monti Livornesi (e.g., Cordecimo and Le Porcarecce faults; Mazzanti, 2016). These offset the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene sediments but are topped by sand beds sedimented in the final part of the Globorotalia margaritae zone at 3.2\u20133.9\u00a0Ma (Mazzanti, 2016). Along the eastern border of Monti Livornesi, NW-SE to NNW-SSE extensional faults outline the sharp transition to the Neogene Fine Basin (e.g., Parrane fault; Mazzanti, 2016), while to the west the study area is bounded by the coastline.\nThe lowermost unit of the tectonic pile outcropping in the Monti Livornesi is the Macigno Formation. A Late Oligocene-Early Miocene turbiditic sandstone which represents the top of the Tuscan nappe (Jacobacci et al., 1967). This is overlaid by the Ligurian sequence, subdivided into four tectonic units (Bartoletti et al., 1986; Cerrina Feroni and Mazzanti, 1966) which from the bottom are: i) Santa Fiora Unit, represented mainly by Upper Cretaceous \u2013 Eocene shales with minor limestones, marls and sandstones; ii) Monteverdi Marittimo \u2013 Lancia Unit, composed by shales, marls, and minor sandstones (Upper Cretaceous) followed by a Jurassic oceanic crust sequence (serpentinised harzburgite, gabbro, and basalt) and covered by Jurassic \u2013 Lower Cretaceous pelagic sediments (calcilutite, shale, and minor limestone). Ultramafic rocks are represented predominantly by serpentinised harzburgite, with minor serpentinised dunite, gabbro, and basalt, with the exception of the south-eastern corner of the area, where basalt becomes the dominant ophiolitic lithology (Bartoletti et al., 1986; Cerrina Feroni and Mazzanti, 1966; Fig. 1); iii) Montaione Unit, formed mainly by an alternation of Upper Cretaceous marls and siltstone levels; and iv) the Palombini shales Unit, composed by shales with limestone beds of Lower Cretaceous age.\n\n\n2.2\nThe Castiglioncello magnesite deposits: state-of-the-art\nIn the Monti Livornesi, magnesite has been mined at Castiglioncello between 1914 and 1945 in three main localities: Masaccio, Campolecciano, and Macchia Escafrullina (Fig. 2) where most of the magnesite production came from underground works and deep trenches (Lovari, 1928; Marinelli, 1955). About 6\u00a0km north, smaller magnesite orebodies, with the same mineralogical, textural, and structural characteristics as those found at Castiglioncello, were also mined at the Bucafonda quarry near the Gabbro village (Marinelli, 1955; Fig. 2). In addition, marcasite has been mined from local sulfide concentration in the magnesite orebodies at Macchia Escafrullina and Bucafonda (Marinelli, 1955). Magnesite constitutes lodes and stockworks in silicified-argillified-carbonated serpentinite. During the mining activity, it has been found that the lodes have an anastomosing pattern with vein stockworks and breccias progressively organising at depth in a single larger lode (Aloisi, 1919; Lovari, 1928) and that these are always hosted by serpentinite and do not propagate in the overlying shales (Lovari 1928). These same characteristics have been found in another magnesite deposit of Southern Tuscany, located \u223c35\u00a0km southeast of Castiglioncello, the Malentrata deposit (Boschi et al., 2009).\nMineralogical studies on the hydrothermal alteration of the serpentinite host have identified the presence of smectites and melanophlogite in dolomite veins (Grassellini Troysi and Orlandi, 1972; Marinelli, 1955; Sartori, 1967). In more distal areas, hydrothermal alteration affected Late Miocene sediments promoting silicification, with the formation of chalcedony and opal, carbonation of gypsum, and precipitation of spherules of green dolomite (Sammartino et al., 2012; Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\nFieldwork and geological mapping have been planned by using available 1:100000, 1:50000 geological maps (Mazzanti, 2016 and references therein) and mining reports (https:\/\/www.pconti.net\/dbgm.html) to localise the mining workings (trenches, adits, shafts). The resulting map and the 3D reconstructions were then used for planning sampling for petrological and geochemical investigations and discussing the relationship between hydrothermal events and tectonics. We used the Field Move software, both at the surface and in underground works, to collect structural measurements and geometry of veins\/lodes as well as alteration style\/degree of the host rocks. The new dataset has been integrated with data from old mining reports and maps (https:\/\/www.pconti.net\/egeo.html; www.isprambiente.gov.it\/Media\/carg\/toscana.html) and digitalised using QGis.\nRepresentative samples of lodes and host rocks for geochemical-isotopic study have been selected from a larger sample set used for the initial petrographic characterisation. Imaging of the carbonate veins and serpentinite host was carried out using a Philips EDAX DX4i scanning electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired on mineral separates and bulk rock powders with a computer-aided, Scintag X-ray diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation at 45\u00a0kV and 40 m\u00c5 at the IGG-CNR (Pisa; Italy). Data were recorded between 4\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 2\u03b8 with steps of 0.02\u00b0 2\u03b8 and one-second counting per step.\nCarbon and Oxygen isotopes of 47 magnesite and 40 dolomite samples were analysed with a Finningan GasBench II interfaced with a Finningan Mat Delta Plus mass spectrometer, at the Stable Isotope Laboratory of the IGG-CNR (Pisa; Italy). Magnesite was drilled from selected samples and then reacted with phosphoric acid at 70\u02daC for 60\u00a0h, whereas dolomite was reacted for 4\u00a0h. The fractionation between magnesite and CO2 during reaction with phosphoric acid has been corrected using the fractionation factor from (Sharma et al., 2002) calculated at 70\u02da. In the absence of an international magnesite standard, an internal magnesite standard and calcite standards were used including MOM, NEW12, and NBS18 international standards. The average analytical error is estimated at \u00b10.1\u2030 for carbon and \u00b10.2\u2030 for oxygen. Results are reported in delta notation relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) for oxygen and to the Vienna PeeDee Belemnite (VPDB) standard for carbon.\n\n\n4\nResults\nDespite the pre-1950s mining activity, a detailed geological survey of the Castiglioncello deposit has never been conducted. Exploration and exploitation were mostly conducted by digging trenches on the largest outcrops of magnesite lodes, which were followed by minor underground diggings. When the mining activity ceased in 1945, the area became covered by a dense Mediterranean shrub that has concealed outcrops and workings. The geological survey performed in the 1970\u00a0s and 1990\u20132010 for the 1:100000 and 1:50000 Geological Map of Italy did not consider the hydrothermal occurrences, being mainly focused on mapping and interpretation of the complex tectonic stack of units. We have focused instead our geological survey on the mineralised area and the surrounding hydrothermal alteration.\n\n4.1\nStructural setting of the Castiglioncello deposit\n\n4.1.1\nThe San Quirico antiformal dome and its NE-trending structural boundaries\nThe architecture of the ophiolite sequence in the study area can be schematised as a discontinuous layer of serpentinite comprised between argillitic formations: the Santa Fiora Unit at the bottom (shales with minor limestones, marls, and sandstones), and the Palombini Shales at the top (shales with minor limestones). The tectonic contacts between these units, where observable, are marked by low to medium angle (\u223c15\u00b0 to \u223c55\u00b0) shear zones, likely developed onto earlier tectonic discontinuities. These shear zones are characterised by chaotic non-cohesive cataclasite, lacking well-preserved shear structures and kinematic indicators. Because of the polyphased tectonic history, these sedimentary units are generally characterised by disrupted bedding patterns. However, approaching the tectonic contacts between sedimentary formations and serpentinite we have observed a progressive parallelisation of the bedding to the contacts (Fig. 3\nA). The contact between serpentinite and Palombini shales, as well as their internal bedding, are arranged in a dominant outward dipping pattern with respect to a central, N- to NW-elongated outcrop of the Santa Fiora Unit (Fig. 3A). In particular, the bedding of the Santa Fiora Unit dips underneath the serpentinite bodies to the NE and SW with an angle ranging from \u223c20\u00b0 to \u223c60\u00b0, whereas at the northern and southern terminations, the serpentinite is elided, and the Santa Fiora Unit dips directly underneath the Palombini shales (Fig. 3A). At the top of the serpentinite slice the Palombini shales mantle both the serpentinite and the Santa Fiora Unit with bedding dipping outwards, with angles ranging from \u223c15\u00b0 to \u223c51\u00b0, with respect to the central Santa Fiora Unit (Fig. 3A).\nThese observations suggest an overall antiformal-dome structure with a broad N- to NW- trend and a core zone represented by the Santa Fiora Unit exposed in a tectonic window with northern and southern periclinal termination (Fig. 3B). The overlying formations (serpentinite and Palombini shales) are exposed along the flanks and periclinal terminations (Fig. 3). This structure is centred on Poggio San Quirico and hereafter will be called SQAD (San Quirico Antiformal Dome). The systematic elision of serpentinite at the periclinal terminations of the SQAD suggests that maximum segmentation of the original serpentinite layer occurred along the antiformal hinge, coherently with the direction of maximum extensional stretching at the regional scale (ca. E-W) (Carmignani et al., 1994). The outcropping of the Santa Fiora Unit in relatively small tectonic windows directly through the Palombini shales at Casa le Spianate and Case le Serre, in the southern portion of the map (Fig. 3) also indicates that the serpentinite slice is not continuous and forms tectonically segmented lenses embedded in the sedimentary formations (Fig. 3B).\nAlthough the regional-scale first-order NE-trending structures are relatively distant from the Castiglioncello deposit (the Livorno-Sillaro structure is 18\u00a0km to the north, whereas the Rosignano - Pomaia is 7\u00a0km to the south) the study area is cut by several second-order NE-trending structures (Figs. 3,\u00a04\nA). In particular, two predominant strike-slip fault systems acted as boundaries for the SQAD, and the mineralised area: The Porcarecce fault system to the north and the Forbici fault system to the south (Fig. 4B). These are represented by a series of sub-parallel high angle to sub-vertical faults with dominant strike-slip movement, offsetting the magnesite lodes and the contact between Ligurian Units and sedimentary formations of the Fine basin (Figs. 3, 4). The argillitic nature of the tectonic units produced diffuse debris covering outcrops in the area and limiting the study of these NE-trending structures but the observable offsets in the lodes and at the contacts with Neogene sediments, suggest at least a stage of right-lateral displacement (Fig. 4B).\n\n\n4.1.2\nMagnesite lodes and the NW-trending fault system\nMagnesite lodes formed in dilatational jogs opened onto NW- to N-trending normal faults which developed in the area delimited by the NE-trending Porcarecce and Forbici fault systems (Fig. 4B). The hydrothermal alteration of the serpentinite follows the NW-trending fault systems and only locally propagates along segments of NE-trending faults (Fig. 4C). We have also found thermal springs, with temperatures between 16 and 24\u02daC (Savi and Orosi, 1864), and travertine deposits aligned onto NW-trending faults (Fig. 4C), suggesting that these structures provide long-lasting conduits for hydrothermal fluids.\nWe have identified three main sub-parallel magnesite lode systems along the SW and the NE flanks of the SQAD that correspond to the three main old mining sites of Masaccio, Campolecciano, and Macchia Escafrullina (Figs. 3, 4). On the western side of the SQAD, the Masaccio lode is the largest and crops out for \u223c1.5\u00a0km from Botro Masaccio to Case San Quirico with a thickness that reaches 20\u00a0m. It has an NW- to N-trend and invariably dips to the west with angles between 40\u02da to 80\u02da. Locally several smaller lodes (1\u20134\u00a0m thick) branch off from the main one with broadly the same trend and attitude. At Campolecciano we identified two main lodes that merge at their northern termination at Botro Fortulla. These are \u223c450\u00a0m long and up to \u223c5\u00a0m thick have a NW- to NNW trend and dip to the west. The swarm on the eastern side of the SQAD has a more complex architecture. At Macchia Escafrullina we have identified three main NW-trending mineralised structures. The easternmost is the largest and is composed by a \u223c1.5\u00a0km long alignment of discontinuous lode outcrops, with a thickness ranging from 1 to 4\u00a0m dipping to the East with angles from 40\u02da to 80\u02da. In between the lode outcrops the fault continuity is highlighted by the pervasive argillification, silicification, and carbonation of the serpentinite host (Fig. 4C). This structure is flanked by two other mineralised faults towards its northern termination. These host two NW-trend lodes dipping to the East with moderate to high angles. We have documented also a discontinuous swarm of minor WNW-trending lodes branching off from the main lode towards the northern portion of the deposit, and ending in correspondence of the Botro Fortulla (Figs. 3, 4).\nThe contact between the lodes and the altered serpentinite host is sharp, characterised by planar surfaces with slickensides and chatter marks indicating a dominant normal sense of movement with a minor left and right lateral displacement (Fig. 5\nA, Supplementary Fig. 1). Multiple fault planes parallel to the lode contacts, with visible slip surfaces and chatter marks, are abundant also inside the magnesite lodes (Fig. 5B-D), and the kinematic indicators suggest a dominant top-down-to-the-south-west sense of movement for the veins on the western side of the SQAD (Masaccio, Case San Quirico, and Campolecciano), while a top-down-to-the-north-east movement for the veins on the eastern side of the SQAD (Macchia Escafrullina). Locally, also NE-trending fault planes, with slickensides and chatter marks indicating a dominant strike-slip movement, have been identified in the magnesite lodes (Fig. 5E). Lodes, and slip surfaces, are confined to the serpentinite lenses and never propagate into the overlying shales. The magnesite lodes commonly display a ramp-flat geometry with slip surfaces and slickensides following the same ramp-flat pattern (Fig. 6\n; Supplementary Fig. 1: MSC2 to MSC5 and MSC10, MSC12).\nThe general orientation of the SQAD axis and the associated NW-trending normal faults (Fig. 4A), coupled with kinematic indicators of deformative structures in the magnesite lodes, are coherent with local extension controlled by the right-lateral movement of the NE-trending Porcarecce and Forbici fault systems, locally complicated by the coeval activity of minor NE-trending strike-slip faults cutting the mineralised area (Fig. 4C).\n\n\n4.1.3\nStockworks and breccias\nThe hydrothermally altered serpentinite wrapping the magnesite lodes is cut by an intricate stockwork of dolomite, magnesite, and opal\/chalcedony veins with a comb-like texture orthogonal to the vein walls (Fig. 7\n). These veins display variable orientation but are generally steeper (subvertical) than the associated lodes. They are thin (max. 5\u00a0cm, mostly less than 1\u00a0cm) but they can be followed up to tens of meters along strike and dip and are in continuity with the carbonate infill that cement the brecciated portions of the magnesite lodes. The dolomite-magnesite stockwork is particularly pervasive in the upper part of the deposit, in proximity to the magnesite lodes terminations, against the overlying shales. Unlike the magnesite lodes, the stockwork propagates into the shale cap forming crown-like structures on top of the lode (Fig. 6C). These veins are constituted by dolomite and chalcedony without magnesite.\nDeformation and carbonate precipitation occurred cyclically, as testified by slip surfaces crosscutting volumes that were previously brecciated and cemented by magnesite, dolomite, and opal-CT\/chalcedony. Brecciation becomes extremely disruptive at the top of the lodes just below the shale contact (Fig. 6C). Here this process involves large volumes of the altered serpentinite envelope and the mineralised structures become a chaotic polymictic megabreccia made by clasts of magnesite, altered serpentinite, and earlier breccias cemented by dolomite and magnesite (Fig. 7C-E). The cement of the megabreccia is made by dolomite, magnesite and minor chalcedony (Fig. C-F). Here we observed the maximum orebody thickness (up to 20\u00a0m), which was also documented in mining reports and previous studies (Lovari, 1928). The lack of slip surfaces in these apical portions, the occurrence of jigsaw structures, the common large cement\/clast ratio, the low matrix content, and the open-space textures of carbonate cement (comb, cockade, crystal vugs; Fig. 7C-F) suggest that brecciation was dominantly controlled by hydraulic fracturing rather than tectonic deformation.\n\n\n\n4.2\nMineralogy, texture, and geometry of the deposit\n\n4.2.1\nThe serpentinite host: distal vs proximal alteration\nThe ultramafic lenses hosting the Castiglioncello deposit are mainly composed of serpentinised spinel-harzburgite with minor gabbro and basalt. Typical outcrops display an alternation of metric to pluri-decametric lenticular bodies of dark-green to black massive porphyroclastic serpentinite (Fig. 8\nA) separated by sub-horizontal centimetric-metric bands of foliated greenish serpentinite. Centimetric veins of fibrous chrysotile are common. The serpentinised spinel-harzburgite is constituted mainly by serpentine (Supplementary Fig. 2A), which forms pervasive mesh texture after olivine (Fig. 8B-D) embedding bastite porphyroclasts which replace orthopyroxene (Fig. 8B). Serpentinisation promoted the formation of fine-grained magnetite mainly dispersed in mesh serpentine and serpentine veins (Fig. 8C-D). Cr-spinel is the main relict after serpentinisation, whereas olivine-pyroxene relics are rare (Fig. 8F).\nThe magnesite orebody is embedded into an alteration envelope where, approaching the lodes, the serpentinite host loses its massive character, rapidly assuming an earthy-soapy appearance (Fig. 9\nA) and becoming orange-brown in colour with emerald green patches (Fig. 9B). Hydrothermal alteration of the serpentinite was pervasive, promoting the total conversion of serpentine into a smectite\u00a0+\u00a0opal-CT\u00a0+\u00a0carbonates assemblage (Fig. 9C-F; Supplementary Fig. 2B, C). The orange-brown assemblage replaces the mesh-textured serpentine and is made by a fine-grained chaotic intergrowth of smectite and opal-CT with variable amounts of Fe-rich magnesite and dolomite (Fig. 9B-F). The green patches represent smectite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0opal-CT aggregates with a variable amount of Fe-rich magnesite, replacing topotactically serpentine bastite porphyroclasts (Fig. 9B-F). Magnesite micro-veins can be locally abundant and cut all the previous structures and alteration (Fig. 9E-F). Relic spinels and magnetite grains have been also identified in the altered portions (Fig. 9E-F). The size of the hydrothermal alteration ranges from few meters around isolated small magnesite veins up to 30\u00a0m around the largest lodes. Locally, alteration propagates also along NE-trending faults when these intersect the deposits (Fig. 4C). Transformation of serpentine into smectites and opal-CT is common during hydrothermal alteration of serpentinites (Caillaud et al., 2006; Wildman et al., 1968a). Smectites can have a 5- to 10-fold less Mg2+ than parental serpentine minerals, which during alteration is leached and held by the fluids (Wildman et al., 1968a, 1968b) becoming available for the precipitation of magnesite.\n\n\n4.2.2\nThe magnesite ore\nThe lodes are constituted by an early infill of massive, cryptocrystalline aggregate of creamy-white magnesite grains (5\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5m) locally showing a mosaic texture (Fig. 10\nA-D). The cryptocrystalline aggregate shows a variable primary porosity (Fig. 10B), locally infilled by chalcedony (Fig. 10C) or opal (Fig. 10D). In many cases, early magnesite has been repeatedly brecciated and cemented by multiple cryptocrystalline magnesite generations and later infilled by coarser dolomite, magnesite, and chalcedony (Fig. 10E). Dolomite and chalcedony veins also cut these brecciated domains (Fig. 10F). The later carbonate infill cementing the brecciated zones of the lodes shows open-space filling textures such as, comb-like, fibrous-parallel, and cockade textures (Fig. 10G-H). Single carbonate crystals are usually 50\u20131000\u00a0\u00b5m thick while their length may easily reach 5\u201310\u00a0mm, up to several cm. The late chalcedony, locally observed in the brecciated zones, displays a similar crustiform-comb texture whereas opal-CT locally forms lepispheres (Fig. 10H).\n\n\n\n4.3\nC-O isotopes\nWe have selected representative samples for carbon and oxygen isotopic analysis from the three main lode systems of the Castiglioncello deposit and also, given the textural ad mineralogical similarities (c.f.\nMarinelli, 1955), added samples from the nearby Gabbro deposit. Table 1\n reports the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of analysed magnesite and dolomite. At Castiglioncello the \u03b413C of magnesite ranges from \u22122.0 to 4.4\u2030 and \u03b418OSMOW varies between 22.3 and 27.4\u2030, for dolomite \u03b413C ranges between \u22125.3 and 2.8\u2030 and \u03b418OSMOW from 20.9 to 23.3\u2030. Magnesite from Gabbro has a \u03b413C composition ranging between 1.5 and 3.9\u2030 and \u03b418OSMOW from 22.0 to 27.7\u2030, whereas dolomite has \u03b413C ranging from \u22120.9 to 3.9\u2030 and \u03b418OSMOW from 20.2 to 26.4\u2030. Because of the lack of an experimentally determined fractionation factor between magnesite and H2O or CO2, we have calculated the isotopic composition of parental fluids using fractionation factors estimated from a regression line (Supp. Fig. 3) based on fractionation factors of carbonates having cations with similar ionic radii to that of magnesium following the approach of Aharon (1988) as described in Supplementary Material. The estimated fractionation factors for oxygen and carbon in the magnesite-H2O and magnesite-CO2 systems are respectively 18\u2030 and 7\u2030 at 100\u02daC (Supp. Fig. 3). We used these values used to calculate parental fluid composition reported in Figs. 11 and 12\n\n and in Table 1.\nOverall, magnesite and dolomite from Castiglioncello and Gabbro have a relatively narrow range in \u03b413C and \u03b418OSMOW, and the calculated isotopic composition of parental fluids for magnesite and dolomite overlaps, suggesting a common origin of CO2 and H2O of the fluids that deposited both magnesite and dolomite at Castiglioncello and Gabbro (Figs. 11, 12).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe Castiglioncello magnesite deposit: Carbonation at epithermal conditions\nThe mineralogical (carbonates\u00a0+\u00a0opal-CT\u00a0+\u00a0chalcedony\u00a0+\u00a0smectite), textural (crustiform-colloform banding, cockade texture, breccias, vein stockworks, crystal vugs) and structural (shallow crustal level, meter-thick dilational jogs) features of the Castiglioncello deposit are consistent with an epithermal style of mineralisation (Pohl, 1990; White and Hedenquist, 1990). Generally, the alteration sequence described for ultramafic-hosted vein-type magnesite deposits is characterised by a first replacement of serpentine by magnesite, followed by the replacement of the remaining serpentine and early carbonate by silica phases (Barnes et al., 1973). Cogenetic clay minerals, such as nontronite, montmorillonite, and stevensite, are also reported (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992). At Castiglioncello field observation, combined with petrographic and XRD (Supplementary Fig. 2) analyses, suggest a different scenario where, first the serpentinite is hydrothermally altered into silica phases (opal-CT\/chalcedony) and clay minerals (Fig. 9) and then, in a second stage, massive magnesite precipitation takes place in lodes (Fig. 5) and stockworks (Fig. 7). This sequence is also reported for other magnesite deposits of Tuscany (Boschi et al., 2009) and California (Henderson, 1969).\n\n\n5.2\nOrigin CO2-bearing fluids\nConsidering the geological setting the possible sources for the CO2-bearing fluids responsible for the formation of magnesite and dolomite at Castiglioncello and Gabbro are: (1) Magmatic fluids derived from intrusions in the upper crust; (2) Fluids derived from decarbonation of sedimentary and metamorphic sequences underlying the deposit; (3) Surficial fluids, represented by infiltrating meteoric water enriched with soil CO2 and (4) Fluids derived from the Earth\u2019s mantle.\n\n5.2.1\nCrustal magmas\nThere is no surficial evidence at Castiglioncello, Gabbro, or in other magnesite deposits of Southern Tuscany, suggesting a direct genetic relationship between magnesite deposits and magmatic activity of Tuscan Magmatic Province (Boschi et al., 2009; Lovari, 1928; Marinelli, 1955). However, relatively high temperature (\u223c300\u02daC) sulfide mineralisation found in the Macigno Formation at Calafuria (Orlandi et al., 2006), about 6\u00a0km North-West of the Castiglioncello deposit (Fig. 2), calls for a magmatic source of heat.\nThe Tuscan Magmatic province is composed of S-type granitoids generated from the anatexis of crustal rocks, and mantle-derived magmas (high-K calc-alkaline, shoshonites, and lamproites, Conticelli and Peccerillo, 1992). For instance, the Orciatico and Montecatini Val di Cecina lamproites, emplaced \u223c4.1\u00a0Ma ago (Conticelli and Peccerillo, 1992) are located \u223c25\u00a0km to the SE of the deposits. Crustal and mantle-derived magmas will have a distinct C-O isotopic signature, which considering the high temperatures involved, would largely reflect that of the primary source, i.e., sedimentary rocks and mantle source region respectively. In this paragraph, we will consider specifically the first end-member, whereas the C-O isotopic composition of mantle-derived magmas will be discussed in the following paragraph 5.2.4.\nFor the end-member representing magmas derived from crustal anatexis, we have considered the \u03b418OSMOW composition of granitoids from the Tuscan magmatic province (Taylor and Turi, 1976), which ranges from 11.2 to 17.0\u2030 and typical \u03b413C values for magmas generated by anatexis of sedimentary rocks which range between \u221235 and \u221225\u2030 (Zhao et al., 2001). At high temperatures fractionation factors between magmas and exsolved fluids are negligible (Hoefs, 1997) thus the C-O isotopic composition of magmatic fluids would reflect that of the magma. Therefore, fluids generated from crustal anatexis would have an isotopic composition that strongly differs from that of magnesite and dolomite parental fluids, especially for \u03b413C, which is 15 to 30\u2030 higher thus, their direct involvement in the formation of carbonates at Castiglioncello and Gabbro can be excluded (Fig. 11).\n\n\n5.2.2\nFluids derived from sedimentary and metamorphic sequences underlying the deposits\nThermogenic release of CO2-rich fluids from carbonate, organic matter-rich, and graphite-rich formations could occur in response to: i) high heat flow through the Tuscan crust; ii) high temperatures experienced at the base of the crust during mantle upwelling; iii) high temperatures in the contact aureoles around magmatic intrusions (Gianelli et al., 1997; Panichi and Tongiorgi, 1975). Tectonically, the serpentinite slices hosting the Castiglioncello and Gabbro deposits are underlain by sedimentary formations belonging to the Ligurian Units and Tuscan Nappe, mainly constituted by limestones, shales, and sandstones, which in turn are underlain by phyllites and micaschists constituting the metamorphic basement (Jacobacci et al., 1967; Mazzanti, 2016).\nThe isotopic data available in the literature for limestones in the Tuscan Nappe are sparse (Billi et al., 2007; Cortecci and Lupi, 1994) and thus they may not fully represent the isotopic variability of the carbonates in this formation. Therefore, to estimate the isotopic composition of a marine limestone end-member we considered a global dataset of C-O isotopic composition of Phanerozoic marine limestones from Veizer et al, (1999) and applied complete Batch and Rayleigh fractionation at 600\u02daC (Fig. 12A). The variability range of isotopic composition of available data from the Tuscan Nappe is also reported in Figs. 11\u00a0and\u00a012A, and it completely falls within the considered global range from Veizer et al. (1999).\nFor carbon, we have used the fractionation factor of calcite-CO2 from (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979) whereas for oxygen that of calcite-CO2 of (Chacko and Deines, 2008). In Fig. 12A we have reported the \u03b413C and \u03b418OSMOW variability range of fluids produced by limestone decarbonation considering Batch fractionation, which gives a minimum estimate for the fractionation effect.\nDecarbonation of limestones at the considered temperature produces CO2 with heavier isotopic composition than the parental calcite, thus shifting the composition of fluids in the opposite direction with respect to the Castiglioncello and Gabbro parental fluids (Fig. 11). Rayleigh fractionation would further exasperate this effect (Fig. 12A).\nShales, which alternate with limestone in the sedimentary sequence underneath the deposits, contain organic matter that can liberate carbon mainly when heated between 400 and 700\u02daC (Basu et al., 2019). To estimate the isotopic composition of CO2 and H2O released from shales we have considered as starting isotopic composition the \u03b413C of organic matter in marine sedimentary sequences, which approximately ranges between \u221220 and \u221230\u2030 (Davies et al., 2012). This range is from Carboniferous mudstone deposited in a range of marine and non-marine environments today outcropping across England and Scotland. These samples are ideal for understanding the isotopic composition of organic carbon in shales because it was derived from both vegetated deltaic and alluvial floodplains and primary production in the water column associated with algal blooms (Davis et al., 2012). Thus, these samples give us a relatively complete range of the organic \u03b413C signature we can expect in shales. For the \u03b418OSMOW composition of Cretaceous shales, we used the database reported by Bindeman et al. (2016) which is largely comprised between 10.0 and 22.0\u2030. We chose this dataset because it presents a comprehensive collection of \u03b418OSMOW isotopic compositions of shales with time.\nWe have modelled the coupled release of CO2 and H2O from this lithology using complete Batch and Rayleigh fractionation at 600\u02daC using for carbon the graphite-CO2 fractionation factor of Ohmoto and Rye (1979) and for oxygen the illite-H2O fractionation factor from Sheppard and Gilg (1996) (Fig. 12B). Our results are in agreement with experimental data showing that CO2 released from shale heating experiments at \u223c600\u02daC (Basu et al., 2019) has an isotopic composition that overlaps the results of our Batch fractionation model (Fig. 12B). Our data show that decarbonation of shales would have an isotopic composition that is incompatible with that of magnesite and dolomite from Castiglioncello and Gabbro, in particular in its \u03b418OSMOW composition is consistently higher for Batch fractionation, and would be increasingly higher under Rayleigh fractionation conditions (Fig. 12B). For the sake of simplicity, in Fig. 11 we have reported only values obtained using the Batch fractionation, representing a minimum estimation of the fractionation effect.\nPhyllites and schists, constituting the metamorphic basement, contain abundant muscovite and locally graphite with minor calcite (Pandeli et al., 1994). To estimate the isotopic composition of CO2 and H2O released from this end-member, we have considered muscovite dehydration as process producing H2O and only graphite as the source of CO2, because calcite has been shown to have a late hydrothermal origin (Gianelli et al., 1997). Heating experiments showed that graphite is relatively refractory and it can release carbon only at high temperature of \u223c1400\u02daC (Basu et al., 2019). However, graphite oxidation in presence of fluids could result in the release of carbon in the form of CO2 (Menzies et al., 2018). We have estimated the \u03b413C composition of CO2 released the oxidation of graphite starting from the \u03b413C composition of organic matter in marine sedimentary sequences (\u221220 to \u221230\u2030; Davies et al., 2012) using the graphite-CO2 fractionation factor of (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979) at 600\u02daC and adopting complete Batch and Rayleigh fractionation (Fig. 12C). Together with CO2 also CH4 can be produced from graphite depending on the relative fO2 of the fluids (Menzies et al., 2018). The CH4 produced would have a lower \u03b413C than graphite and thus by considering only CO2 we obtain maximum \u03b413C values for carbon released by this end-member. Therefore, considering CH4 would shift the variability field for this end-member even further away from the isotopic composition of Castiglioncello and Gabbro parental fluids.\nTo estimate the \u03b418O of fluids produced by muscovite dehydration we considered as starting \u03b418O values those of primary (detrital) muscovite in the Tuscan metamorphic basement which ranges between 12.1 and 13.8\u2030, (Bulle et al., 2020). These values are in the range of those obtained by (Gianelli and Ruggieri, 2002) on bulk micaschist samples from different localities in Tuscany. We have estimated the \u03b418OSMOW signature of H2O produced by muscovite dehydration using the muscovite-H2O fractionation factor of (O\u2019Neil and Taylor, 1969) at 600\u02daC. In Fig. 11 we have reported the variability of fluids produced by this end-member considering Batch fractionation. Rayleigh fractionation would produce a similar \u03b418O range with a stronger enrichment in \u03b413C, which is too high to be compatible with the signature of parental fluids at Castiglioncello and Gabbro (Fig. 12C).\nTherefore, fluids derived either from shales or limestones underneath the deposits could not directly precipitate magnesite and dolomite with isotopic signatures found at Castiglioncello and Gabbro (Fig. 11).\n\n\n5.2.3\nSurficial reservoirs\nMagnesite in ultramafic massifs has been also proposed to form from fluids and CO2 derived from surficial reservoirs, in particular meteoric water and either atmospheric or soil CO2 (del Real et al., 2016; Fallick et al., 1991; Kralik et al., 1989; Mirnejad et al., 2008; Quesnel et al., 2013). However, considering the lower carbon concentration in the atmosphere compared to soils, the dominant source would likely be the soil (Oh et al., 2005). In Central Italy meteoric water has \u03b418OSMOW ranging from \u221215.3 to \u22124.9\u2030 (Giustini et al., 2016). CO2 from soil can be dissolved by meteoric water infiltrating the recharge area of the aquifer (Oh et al., 2005). In the isotopic composition of carbon dissolved in aquifers and active springs of Central Italy, it has been recognised the contribution of an organic carbon end-member with a \u03b413C signature between \u221215\u2030 and \u221230\u2030 (Chiodini et al., 2010, 2004). Considering these ranges in \u03b413C and \u03b418OSMOW we have constructed a box in Fig. 11 representing a surficial end-member composed of meteoric water enriched by soil CO2. This end-member has significantly lower \u03b413C and \u03b418OSMOW ranges than parental fluids of the Castiglioncello and Gabbro carbonates, thus direct precipitation of the studied magnesite and dolomite from surficial fluids can be excluded.\nHowever, given that the parental fluids of carbonates at Castiglioncello and Gabbro fall in an intermediate field between the surficial fluids box and that of fluids produced by decarbonation of limestones, their isotopic composition could derive from mixing of fluids coming from these two end-members (Fig. 11).\nTo test this hypothesis, we have calculated mixing lines for fluids deriving from these two endmembers following the approach of (Langmuir et al., 1978; Supplementary Material). Our calculation shows that the low CO2 solubility of surficial fluids, compared to the much higher CO2 solubility in fluids generated at higher pressure from limestone decarbonation, dominates the shape of the mixing line, i.e., large variations in \u03b418OSMOW are correlated with negligible variations in \u03b413C at low to medium degrees of mixing. In this scenario, the mixed fluid attains a compatible \u03b413C signature with that of Castiglioncello and Gabbro parental fluids only when the surficial component in the mix is above 90%. However, at this degree of mixing the resulting \u03b418OSMOW signature is \u223c10 to \u223c20\u2030 lower than that of the magnesite and dolomite parental fluids (Fig. 11B), therefore also the precipitation of the Castiglioncello and Gabbro carbonates from fluids deriving from the mixing of a surficial reservoir and limestone decarbonation can be excluded.\n\n\n5.2.4\nMantle fluids and melts\nTwo main mechanisms have been proposed for the migration of CO2 from the mantle to the Earth\u2019s surface: i) CO2 is transferred by mantle melts, from the mantle to shallow crust, where CO2 is degassed during magma ascent and crystallization in volcanic and plutonic settings (O\u2019nions and Oxburgh, 1988) ii) CO2 degassed directly from the mantle (especially in extensional settings) rises through the crust by both pervasive flow (grain boundary porosity) and channelised flow (fracture\/fault conduits).\nTo estimate the carbon isotopic composition of the mantle underneath the study area, we can consider the current diffuse non-volcanic emissions in Central and Southern Italy where it has been identified a regional-scale CO2 flux with \u03b413C between \u22125\u2030 and 1\u2030, considered of mantle origin (Chiodini et al., 2011, 2004, 1999). This range overlaps the \u03b413C of CO2 from volcanic and geothermal emissions in Central and Southern Italy (-5.2 to 1.0\u2030) (Capasso et al., 2005; Carapezza and Federico, 2000) and also the range of \u03b413C of fluids inclusions in mantle minerals sampled by volcanic rocks in Central Italy (\u22122.8\u2030 to \u22121.5\u2030; Gennaro et al., 2017). These values are slightly heavier than those of typical MORB mantle, which range between \u20139.1\u2030 and \u22122.9\u2030 with most data plotting around \u223c-5\u2030 (Deines, 2002; Marty and Jambon, 1987), and are considered the result of carbonate metasomatism of the mantle underneath the Tyrrhenian portion of the Italian peninsula induced by subduction (Frezzotti et al., 2009; Gennaro et al., 2017). Carbonate metasomatism of the mantle in this area has been also inferred from the geochemistry and isotopic composition of magmas (Ammannati et al., 2016; Avanzinelli et al., 2018; Conticelli and Peccerillo, 1992).\nRegarding oxygen, depleted mantle is considered to have a \u03b418OSMOW composition of \u223c5.5\u2030 (Hoefs, 1997), however, variations are observed in relation to different degrees of metasomatism and sources of the metasomatic agents. The \u03b418O composition of metasomatic mantle underneath the study area can be estimated from the \u03b418O of mantle-derived magmas and minerals erupted in this region. The \u03b418O composition of olivine in mantle-derived melts from the Tuscan and Roman magmatic province ranges between 6.7 and 7.4\u2030 (Barnekow, 2001), and because of the low oxygen diffusion coefficients in olivine these \u03b418O values can be considered to represent those of the mantle source (Barnekow, 2001). A 18O enriched mantle underneath Tuscany is confirmed by the \u03b418O composition of zircons in lamproitic rocks from Capraia island, which have \u03b418OSMOW ranging between 7.7 and 9.3\u2030, with an average of 8.5\u2030.\n(Gagnevin et al., 2011). In Fig. 11 we have reported a box for mantle \u03b413C and \u03b418O which encompasses the variability range of metasomatised (Barnekow, 2001; Gagnevin et al., 2011; Gennaro et al., 2017) and depleted (Marty and Jambon, 1987; Mattey et al., 1994) end-members. The \u03b413C composition of magnesite and dolomite parental fluids is almost entirely comprised in this mantle field, with only two samples of dolomite plotting outside this range, slightly towards lower values. \u03b418O of both magnesite and dolomite instead is only partially comprised within the mantle field and tends to propagate towards lighter values (Fig. 11). This trend can be explained by the mixing between mantle CO2-rich fluids and a surficial end-member composed of meteoric water and soil CO2. This is supported by modelling of mixing between these two end-members, which shows that the observed trend can be achieved by mixing mantle fluids with up to \u223c50% of surficial fluids (Fig. 10B). These results envisage a scenario in which mantle CO2 rises through the crust and mixes with meteoric water in a serpentinite aquifer which became the hydrothermal reactor for carbon mineralisation (Fig. 13\n).\nBecause of the very small fractionation factors governing isotope exchange at high temperatures (Friedman and O\u2019Neil, 1977), both CO2-rich fluids, directly released from the mantle, and those released from mantle-magmas emplaced into the crust are virtually indistinguishable. Therefore, at the present stage of knowledge, it is not possible to say whether the CO2 sequestered during the formation of the Castiglioncello deposit directly ascended from the mantle or it was degassed by intrusions of mantle-derived magma emplaced into the crust.\n\n\n\n5.3\nTectonically driven carbonation at epithermal conditions\nEven if an important role of tectonics has been widely recognised in models for the formation of vein-type magnesite deposits at epithermal conditions, mainly because of the mineralisation in stockwork and open fractures, its specific role in promoting carbonation has yet to be understood (Abu-Jaber and Kimberley, 1992; Pohl, 1990).\nAt Castiglioncello we identified three main steps crucial for carbonation and the formation of the magnesite deposit: i) the development of a structural trap that allowed the concentration of CO2 into serpentinite lenses; ii) the creation of crustal-scale pathways for the rising of mantle CO2 into the shallow crust; and iii) the opening of dilatational fault jogs where magnesite precipitated forming massive lodes. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the role of tectonics in these key steps to elaborate a genetic model that takes into account our textural, isotopic, and structural observations.\n\n5.3.1\nDevelopment of structural traps for the concentration of CO2 into serpentinite\nThe concentration of CO2 into serpentinite lenses, where it could mix with meteoric water is a prerequisite for the establishment of the epithermal system responsible for the formation of the deposit. Field evidence indicates that this was possible at Castiglioncello thanks to the embedding of isolate serpentinite lenses into nominally impermeable argillitic formation, creating a permeability contrast that convoyed CO2 and meteoric water into the serpentinite (Fig. 3). The formation of these optimal hydrothermal reactors can be seen as a net result of the tectonic evolution of the Inner Northern Apennine. The collisional phase of the Apennine orogenesis produced a heterogeneous upper crustal sequence, where serpentinite became piled up in between argillitic formations, creating a strong rheological contrast in the tectonic pile. Following the compressional phase, the Early-Middle Miocene extension produced the segmentation of the more competent levels in the tectonic pile (Brogi, 2004; Carmignani et al., 1994). This process is well-known in Southern Tuscany where the more competent levels of the tectonic pile lensed out and became embedded into argillitic formations, forming megaboudins at the regional scale (Brogi, 2004; Carmignani et al., 1994). At Castiglioncello the rheological contrast between serpentinite, which has a brittle behaviour in the shallow crust (Raleigh and Paterson, 1965), and the argillitic formations, promoted the preferential fracturing and faulting of the serpentinite and its segmentation producing separate lenses completely enclosed into argillitic formations (Fig. 13). The formation of a meteoric-water aquifer in the serpentinite lenses requires that exhumation, by extensional tectonics and erosion, brought these lenses at shallower levels in the crust where they could become permeated by descending meteoric water thanks to transient permeability of the top layers through faulting (Fig. 13).\n\n\n5.3.2\nMantle CO2 rising through crustal-scale pathways\nC-O isotopes indicate that the formation of the Castiglioncello magnesite deposits required the supply of a significant amount of mantle-derived CO2 to a shallow crustal epithermal system. The localisation of hydrothermal alteration and magnesite mineralisation along NW-trending faults show a first-order control of tectonics on fluid flow and serpentinite carbonation during the genesis of the deposit (Fig. 4C). The mineralised NW-trending faults are associated with almost orthogonal NE-trending strike-slip faults that were coevally active since both are affected by syn-tectonic hydrothermal circulation (Fig. 4C).\nIn rifting environments, extension is often accommodated by coexisting normal faults and nearly orthogonal strike-slip faults playing as transfer zones (Bally et al., 1981). Normal NW-trending almost orthogonal to NE-trending strike slip faults are interpreted at the regional scale as the surface expression of transfer zones (Liotta et al., 2015; Liotta and Brogi, 2020). These are considered lithospheric tear faults which reach the base of the crust (Rosenbaum and Piana Agostinetti, 2015) and consist of brittle shear zones that produced highly fractured and permeable rock volumes (Liotta, 1991; Liotta and Brogi, 2020; Rosenbaum and Piana Agostinetti, 2015). NE-trending transfer zones in the inner Northern Apennine are known to control magmatic activity (Acocella and Funiciello, 2006; Dini et al., 2008), hydrothermal circulation (Liotta and Brogi 2020), and the genesis of ore deposits (Brogi et al., 2011) but they have also the potential to channel upwards deep, mantle-derived melts (Dini et al., 2008). This is testified in central Tuscany by the emplacement of lamproites along these structures, such as at Orciatico and Montecatini Val di Cecina (Conticelli and Peccerillo, 1992; Dini et al., 2008).\nThus, we suggest that carbonation and the formation of the Castiglioncello magnesite deposit is genetically connected to a NE-trending transfer zone that provided the crustal-scale permeability for the rising of mantle CO2. Considering more specifically the presence of normal faults jogs recording opposite sense of movements on the flanks of the SQAD antiformal dome (Figs. 3\u00a0and\u00a04A), the overall architecture of the deposit is compatible also with local uplift, doming, and lateral extrusion of the shallow sedimentary sequences, caused by the emplacement of a magmatic intrusion at depth (c.f.\nVezzoni et al., 2018). This scenario would be in agreement with the presence of high-temperature mineralisation in the Macigno Formation at Calafuria (Orlandi et al., 2006) about 6\u00a0km North-West of the Castiglioncello deposit (Fig. 2). However, the lack of a significant heat flow anomaly in the Monti Livornesi and the presence of only low-temperature hydrothermal springs (Savi and Orosi, 1864) point to a relatively old magmatic event and\/or relatively high depth of emplacement compared to other well-known magmatic-hydrothermal systems of Southern Tuscany (Dini et al., 2005).\n\n\n5.3.3\nOpening dilatational jogs and triggering mineralisation\nMixing of ascending mantle CO2 with meteoric water in serpentinite lenses had the effect of reducing the solution pH, and enhancing the release of Mg2+ from serpentine (Sanna et al., 2013). Possibly, the ascending CO2 could have also heated the system by advective heat transfer (c.f. Chiodini et al., 2013), creating a CO2\u2013 and Mg2+-rich hydrothermal fluid. Precipitation of carbonates, and formation of lodes, require a coupled shift from the initial acidic conditions to higher pH (>\u223c9; Rimstidt, 1997) to stabilise the carbonate ion, and the opening of dilatational fault jogs.\nIn this geological context, a pH increase can be caused by the progressive interaction of fluid with the serpentinite (Boschi et al., 2009; Cipolli et al., 2004) or by the loss of part of the CO2 dissolved in the fluid through boiling (Reed, 1985). Even though fluid-rock interaction could have played a role in regulating the pH of the hydrothermal solution, the abrupt change in pH required for the precipitation of massive cryptocrystalline magnesite lodes could have been promoted more efficiently by boiling (Muffler et al., 1971). The interaction between NW-trending and NE-trending fault systems in an overall extensional regime determined the opening of fault jogs onto NW-trending faults exclusively inside the serpentinite lenses.\nThe fluid pressure differential developed between the jog interior and its surroundings drove CO2-and Mg2+-rich fluids from the serpentinite host into the open jogs (c.f.\nSibson, 1987). Due to the pressure drop, the solution boiled and partially released CO2, making pH suddenly increase, stabilising the carbonate ion (CO3\n2\u2013) and triggering sudden precipitation of cryptocrystalline massive magnesite. Cyclical brecciation and faulting had a key role in sustaining the necessary permeability for subsequent batches of CO2 and fluids to enter the serpentinite reactor, become enriched in Mg2+, and precipitate new generations of magnesite and dolomite (c.f.\nBoschi et al., 2009).\nThe age of the deposit even though cannot be directly determined, because of the lack of suitable minerals for isotopic dating, it can be constrained by the tectonic activity of NE-trending structures. In particular, the activity of the Porcarecce fault system can be constrained between Late-Miocene and Early-Pliocene (Mazzanti et al., 2016). This is in agreement with the observation of the hydrothermal silicification and gypsum carbonation of the Late Miocene sediments in distal portions of the deposit (Sammartino et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this study, we have shown that carbonation during the genesis of the Castiglioncello magnesite deposit was a syn-tectonic process that took place in an epithermal environment where CO2, sourced mainly from the Earth\u2019s mantle, mixed with meteoric water, became enriched in Mg2+ through serpentine alteration and precipitated magnesite in dilatational fault jogs in response to tectonic activity. This provides an alternative model to the dominant view of post-tectonic\/supergene carbonation, where CO2 and fluids are mainly derived from the surficial environment or decarbonation reactions in the shallow crust. At Castiglioncello we identified a fundamental role of tectonics in establishing and sustaining the epithermal system responsible for magnesite mineralisation. More specifically, carbonation was driven by subsequent tectonic events during the evolution of the Northern Apennines, and in particular by: i) the Oligocene-Early Miocene compressional event; ii) the Early-Middle Miocene extensional event; iii) the post-Messinian (Late-Miocene-Early Pliocene) extensional event.\nThe first two events resulted in the formation of serpentinite-hosted meteoric aquifers in the shallow crust. The third event created crustal-scale pathways that conveyed mantle CO2 into the aquifers, promoting epithermal alteration and lastly opening dilatational fault jogs where magnesite precipitated. Cyclical fracturing guaranteed the necessary permeability for the ingress of new batches of fluids, prolonged alteration, and CO2 mineralisation. The C-O isotopic signature of magnesite and dolomite testify that transfer zones, in the inner Northern Apennine, do not only control the localisation of magmatism and hydrothermal systems, but are also pathways of volatiles from the Earth\u2019s mantle to the shallow crust and possibly the atmosphere.\n\n","2":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe gold mining industry, over the years, has been a significant contributor to the economy of Ghana (cf. Trading Economics, 2022). Currently, Ghana is the leading producer of gold on the African continent, with an annual production of \u223c143 tonnes (major producers, e.g., AngloGold Ashanti, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited), ranking ahead of South Africa\u2019s \u223c120 tonnes (cf. Gold Outlook, 2022). Given this, the continuous search for new potential areas for gold mineralisation across Ghana is vital to sustain and expand mining activities and attract more investors to the mining industry. In many parts of the world, mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM), which is a multicriteria decision-making task, has been used to identify potential areas for a sought-after mineral deposit (Sadeghi et al., 2014; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015; Porwal et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2019). The implementation of MPM in geographic information system (GIS) provides an efficient means of analysing and integrating geoscience datasets (e.g., geology, geochemistry, magnetic, magnetotelluric, electrical resistivity tomography, remote sensing), as well as identifying and prioritising potential areas for further exploration activities (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Carranza et al., 2009; Joly et al., 2012; Sadeghi and Khalajmasoumi, 2015; Porwal and Carranza, 2015; Sun et al., 2019; Yousefi et al., 2019).\nThe GIS-based MPM models can be: (1) knowledge-driven, such as index overlay, Boolean logic, and fuzzy logic (An et al., 1991; 1992; Bonham-Carter, 1994; Barkaoui et al., 2015; Chudasama et al., 2016; Forson et al., 2020); and (2) data-driven, such as logistic regression, weights of evidence, and neural networks (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Agterberg and Cheng, 2002; Porwal et al., 2010; Joly et al., 2012). The mentioned models differ in the approach by which model parameters are estimated either based on expert knowledge (knowledge-driven) or based on the empirical spatial distribution of known mineral deposits (data-driven) in the study area (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Joly et al., 2012). However, hybrid models (e.g., hybrid neuro-fuzzy model) use data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches to estimate model parameters (Porwal et al., 2004; 2006; Zuo et al., 2009). Despite the efficiency and success of GIS-based MPM in many exploration domains (An et al., 1991; Bonham-Carter, 1994; Carranza et al., 2009; Joly et al., 2012; Sadeghi et al., 2012; 2014; Porwal and Carranza, 2015; Sun et al., 2019), the approach is yet to be widely deployed to gold exploration in Ghana (Karikari, 2002; Chudasama et al., 2016; Forson et al., 2020).\nThe Ahafo gold district (Fig. 1\n) in Ghana was chosen as a case study area for GIS-based MPM because it was once a prominent exploration field with over a half-century of exploration history (Griffis et al., 2002). Although exploration activities in the Ahafo district have slowed in recent years, it is still a potential gold-producing district (Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021). Orogenic gold deposits (also known as lode-gold deposits) in the district (Fig. 1) have been prospected and discovered using integrated petrophysical analysis of rock samples and geophysical data from techniques such as magnetic, gravity, and induced polarisation (Griffis et al., 2002; Newmont Mining Corporation, 2004; Tsiboah and Grant, 2009; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019). An orogenic gold deposit is a type of hydrothermal mineral deposit. It is formed at convergent plate margins in accretionary and collisional orogens, reflecting subduction-related metamorphic processes in deep-crustal environments (Barley and Groves, 1992; Groves et al., 1998, 2018; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Hlaing et al., 2021). This type of gold deposit is a major source of gold produced worldwide, and it is often associated with deformed metamorphic terranes of all ages (Groves et al., 1998). The metamorphic facies varies from greenschist to amphibolite and, to some extent, granulite facies (Groves, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). Orogenic gold deposits form at different depths and temperatures within the Earth\u2019s crust. They are classified as epizonal deposits (<6\u00a0km; 150 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C), mesozonal deposits (6\u201312\u00a0km; 300 to 475\u00a0\u00b0C), and hypozonal deposits (>12\u00a0km; >475\u00a0\u00b0C) (Hagemann and Ridley, 1993; Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995; Groves et al., 1998). Geological structures (e.g., faults, shear zones, lithological boundaries) are the primary control of orogenic gold mineralisation at all scales. The structures control fluid migration and deposition processes by creating permeable pathways and directing deposition to structurally controlled areas (Groves et al., 1998; Vearncombe and Zelic, 2015).\nThe lode-gold deposits in the Ahafo gold district and across Ghana (\u223c136-Moz: Dawes, 2019) are structurally controlled, and they often occur in spatial proximity to shear zones, alteration zones, and lithological discontinuities (Kesse, 1985; Griffis et al., 2002; Masurel et al., 2021). Magnetic and radiometric datasets were utilised to identify the geological features relevant to lode-gold mineralisation in the district. These techniques have been used successfully to enhance and delineate lithological contacts, structural lineaments (e.g., fault, shear zone), and hydrothermally altered zones in various geological settings (Wilford et al., 1997; de Quadros et al., 2003; Wemegah et al., 2015; Maden and Akaryal\u0131, 2015; Elkhateeb and Abdellatif, 2018; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019; Raju and Kumar, 2020). Mineral deposits are often formed from complex interplays between ore-forming processes that leave their imprints in the form of distinct geological features (Gessner et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019). Spatial analysis provides a means to: (i) delineate patterns of ore-related geological features; and (ii) establish the inherent correlation between the features and mineral deposits. Through spatial analyses, different expressions of ore-forming processes and critical components of mineral systems can be translated into mappable spatial proxies. A prospectivity map can be generated based on the proxies (Wyborn et al., 1994; Joly et al., 2012; Chudasama et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019).\nIn this paper, the orogenic gold hydrothermal system approach (i.e. a mineral systems approach to address components critical for the formation of orogenic gold deposits) (Groves et al., 1998; Gaboury, 2019) was used to evaluate the physical and chemical processes that govern the formation of lode-gold deposits in the Ahafo district. The different expressions of ore-forming processes and critical components of the orogenic gold hydrothermal system were translated into mappable spatial proxies, and evidential layers were generated based on the proxies (Joly et al., 2012; Chudasama et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). Prospectivity maps were created using two GIS-based MPM models: fuzzy logic and multi-index overlay (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Joly et al., 2012; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). The classical index overlay method (knowledge-driven MPM) requires discrete-value evidential layers with subjectively-assigned weights as input (Bonham-Carter, 1994). Here, in the multi-index overlay model, logistic functions are used to generate continuous-value evidential layers (Nyk\u00e4nen et al., 2008), and a data-driven approach in the form of a prediction-area plot was adopted to assign objective weights to layers based on their ability to predict mineral occurrence (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). With the fuzzy logic model, the fuzzy membership function and parameters (e.g., weight and confidence factor) assigned to the evidential layers were based on 'experts' judgment (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Joly et al., 2012). The resulting prospectivity maps identified potential zones for lode-gold mineralisation in the Ahafo gold district. These maps were compared, analysed, and evaluated to determine their predictive accuracy and efficiency.\n\n\n2\nLocation and geological setting of the Ahafo gold district\nIn southwestern Ghana, a magmatic accretion and plutonism (ca. 2190\u20132130\u00a0Ma: Amponsah, 2012), which predates the synchronous Eburnean orogeny, resulted in the development of linear granite-greenstone belts (e.g., Ashanti, Sefwi, and Bui) separated by syn-orogenic sedimentary basins (e.g., Sunyani-Como\u00e9, Kumasi-Afema, and Cape Coast). At the regional scale, the bedrock of Ghana is comprised of metamorphosed Birimian Supergroup, overlain by the metasedimentary rocks of the Tarkwaian Group. These lithological units form part of the Archean to Paleoproterozoic (2.3\u20131.9\u00a0Ga) Man-Leo Shield in the West African craton (Kesse, 1985; Griffis et al., 2002; Perrouty et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2016; McFarlane et al., 2019) and host the majority of Ghana\u2019s gold deposits (>170 Moz: Dawes, 2019).\nThe Birimian Supergroup (Griffis et al., 2002; Masurel et al., 2021) is made up of metavolcanics (ca. 2200\u20132160\u00a0Ma: e.g., mica schists, andesites, gabbros, and diorites), and metasediments which comprise flysch-type sedimentary rocks (ca. 2135\u20132110\u00a0Ma: e.g. graywackes, sandstones, siltstones, mudstones). The Tarkwaian Group (ca. 2132\u20132090\u00a0Ma: Davis et al., 1994; Pigois et al., 2003) consists of a variety of sandstones (quartzites), conglomerates, and argillites (phyllites). Several Paleoproterozoic granitoids intruded the metasediments, metavolcanics, and Tarkwaian Group during Eoeburnean (granodiorite-diorite-tonalite, ca. 2180\u20132135; biotite-granite, ca. 2115\u20132090\u00a0Ma) and Eburnean (two-mica leucogranite, ca. 2090\u20132080\u00a0Ma) plutonism (de Kock et al., 2011; Perrouty et al., 2012; Masurel et al., 2021). Granitoids that intruded late Eburnean phase are often K-feldspar rich and are mainly found in the Akyem, Kumasi, and Sunyani basins (Perrouty et al., 2012). These granitoids cross-cut all major regional structures (Kesse, 1985; McFarlane et al., 2019).\nThe Ahafo gold district is located at the transition zone between the NW margin of the Sefwi granite-greenstone belt and the adjacent Sunyani-Como\u00e9 basin (Fig. 1). The study area extends from Dotom in the south to Akwasua in the north (\u223c90\u00a0km stretch). The basaltic and andesitic metavolcanics of the Sefwi group (Perrouty et al., 2012) are intruded by intermediate granitoids (Griffis et al., 2002; GMC, 2010). The granitoids in the study area are Eburnean biotite-granites, leucogranites, and Eoeburnean diorite-granodiorite-tonalite (McFarlane et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021). The district comprises highly metamorphosed metasediments (greywackes with turbidite features, phyllites, slates, schists, and cherty sediments), volcaniclastic sediments (volcaniclastics), and Paleoproterozoic mafic dykes (Fe-rich rocks). Significant orogenic gold deposits in the study area include the Subika (one of the largest known deposits currently mined), Apensu, Awonsu, and Amoma deposits. These deposits are hosted in the diorite-granodiorite-tonalite and metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary rocks (Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021).\nThe transition zone between the greenstone belts and sedimentary basins in south-western Ghana is exemplified by structurally controlled ductile fabrics developed in the shear zones, as illustrated for the Sefwi belt and the adjacent basins (Fig. 2\n\na; Feybesse et al., 2006). The transition zones between the belts and basins host shallow mesozonal to epizonal syn-orogenic gold deposits (Fig. 2\nb; GMC, 2010). The Kenyase-Yamfo shear zone (Fig. 1) (located at the NW transition zone of the Sefwi granite-greenstone belt) is a vital structure controlling lode-gold mineralisation in the Ahafo gold district (GMC, 2010; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019).\nMetamorphism of the lithological units varies from lower greenschist facies (250\u2013360\u00a0\u00b0C and 0.5\u20134 Kbars) to lower amphibolite facies (500\u2013650\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u20136 Kbar) (John et al., 1999; Griffis et al., 2002; Allibone et al., 2004; Perrouty et al., 2012; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019). Quartz vein-associated sulphide (pyrite\/arsenopyrite) and hydrothermal gold mineralisation in basement-type granitoids are the major mineralisation types in the Ahafo gold district (GMC, 2010; Smith et al., 2016; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021). At the deposit scale (<5 km), mineralised zones are characterised by intense alteration (Masurel et al., 2021), such as chlorite-sericite-pyrite (\u223c0.1\u20131\u00a0g\/t Au), chlorite-sericite-pyrite-albite-Fe-carbonate-silica (\u223c1\u20133\u00a0g\/t Au), and silica-Fe-carbonate-albite-pyrite (>3 g\/t Au).\n\n2.1\nStructural deformation\nThe lithological groups in southwestern Ghana have undergone a series of deformational episodes (D1-D6) associated with the Eburnean orogeny (ca. 2150\u20131980\u00a0Ma: Davis et al., 1994; Feybesse et al., 2006; Perrouty et al., 2012; McFarlane et al., 2019). The structural domain in the Ahafo district comprises several Eburnean phase faults (e.g., N-, NE-, to ENE-striking faults) and shear zones (Fig. 1, e.g., Ketesso, Kenyase-Yamfo, Bibiani-Af\u00e9ma, and Hwidiem shear zones), rendering the region highly tectonised (Griffis et al., 2002; Masurel et al., 2021). The D1 deformation, which predates the Tarkwaian Group (Perrouty et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2016), is linked to the regional-scale folding in the Sefwi Group through NS compression in the Ashanti belt. The D1 NNW-SSE shortening in the Sefwi belt is associated with high-grade metamorphism, where crustal thickening generated two mica and muscovite granites (ca. 2092\u20132081\u00a0Ma: McFarlane et al., 2019). D2 structures developed in the Sefwi belt have moderate to steep dipping with strikes in the WSW-ENE to NE-SW directions (Smith et al., 2016; McFarlane et al., 2019). The D3 deformation is marked by large folds and shear zones formed through NW-SE compression within the Birimian and Tarkwaian Groups (Perrouty et al., 2012). The D3 deformation in the Sefwi belt was described by McFarlane et al. (2019) as a gradual E-W directed shortening event in a strike-slip context, resulting in the dispersed accommodation of strain along small shear zones. D4 deformation is linked to reactivated splays of the Ashanti fault (Perrouty et al., 2012) and sinistral oblique reactivation of the NNE-SSW Bibiani and Chirano shear zones of the Sefwi granite-greenstone belt (McFarlane et al., 2019). Synchronous late faults oriented in NW-SE, NE-SW, and E-W in the Sefwi belt, developed during D5 WNW-ESE shortening (Smith et al., 2016; McFarlane et al., 2019). The D6 event formed open folds defined by a sub-vertical crenulation cleavage (Perrouty et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2016).\nThe migration of ore-forming hydrothermal fluids from deep-crustal sources to trap zones requires pathways (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Gaboury, 2019). The structural architecture of southwestern Ghana reveals that the fluid pathways (Fig. 2\nb) are the deep-seated Eburnean D2 and D3 fault systems that were reactivated during belt-basin inversion in convergent tectonic settings under compressive stress regimes (Feybesse et al., 2006; Chudasama et al., 2016). Late-orogenic processes that improved crustal permeability aided the circulation of gold-bearing fluids (Feybesse et al., 2006).\n\n\n2.2\nA mineral systems approach to the orogenic gold hydrothermal system in the Ahafo district\nThe mineral systems approach (MSA) provides a comprehensive view of the geological processes (e.g., a fluid source, physical, and chemical processes) essential for the generation and preservation of mineral deposits at a variety of scales (Wyborn et al., 1994; Knox-Robinson and Wyborn, 1997; Sun et al., 2019). Various researchers have used the MSA to evaluate concepts concerning the genesis of orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Wyman et al., 2016). In view of MSA, the key geological components and processes of an orogenic gold hydrothermal system critical for forming orogenic gold deposits include (Wyborn et al., 1994; Groves et al., 1998; Gaboury, 2019): (i) the source region (e.g., mantle, crust) for ore-forming components (e.g., metals, fluids); (ii) the essential ligands and their sources; (iii) the solubility of gold and its potential sources; (iv) migration pathways for ore-forming materials from source regions and trap zones; and (v) development of trap zones (i.e. physical and chemical traps) suitable for modifying the composition of metalliferous fluid through physical and chemical processes that lead to deposition of gold.\n\n\n2.3\nOrogenic gold hydrothermal system in the Ahafo gold district\nThe source of the massive amounts of hydrothermal fluids needed to create widespread gold-bearing quartz systems has also been a point of contention, with meteoric and connate waters also being suggested (Leube et al., 1990; Eisenlohr and Hirdes, 1992; Oberth\u00fcr et al., 1995; GMC, 2010). During Birimian volcanic activity, submarine exhalation of base metal- and gold-bearing fluids produced chemical sediments enriched in gold, silica, sulphides, manganese, and carbonate minerals (Kesse, 1985; Leube et al., 1990). Fluid inclusion studies show that H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CO2\u00a0+\u00a0N2 dominated the hydrothermal fluids with minor CH4 and very low salinities (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 1995; Yao et al., 2001; Griffis et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2016). The extensive folding and faulting which developed during Eburnean metamorphism created permeable channel-ways (active fluid pathways) for fluid migration (Fig. 2\nb) (Feybesse et al., 2006). The large, syn- to late-tectonic Eburnean granitoids (two-mica leucogranite, biotite-granite) intruding the Sunyani-Como\u00e9 and Kumasi-Afema basins (Fig. 1) acted as \u2018heat engine\u2019 to drive hydrothermal fluids through the permeable pathways towards the margins of the basins and belts where the most favourable environments (i.e. favourable physical and chemical traps) are located for gold deposition in significant concentrations (Kesse, 1985; Feybesse et al., 2006; GMC, 2010). Many of the later-stage Eburnean orogenic gold deposits (ca. 2110\u20132060\u00a0Ma: Th\u00e9baud et al., 2020; \u223c170-Moz: Dawes, 2019), including deposits in the Ahafo district, are associated with major shear zones and fault systems that penetrated to deep crustal level, migrating hydrothermal fluids from source regions to trap zones (GMC, 2010; Th\u00e9baud et al., 2020).\nIn this paper, sources of the mineralising fluids, transporting ligands and metals which are mappable on a regional scale (McCuaig et al., 2010; Morgenstern et al., 2018) cannot be resolved uniformly with the available exploration datasets (i.e. it is difficult to map their expression from the available geoscience datasets used in this paper). Thus, the significant critical processes of the orogenic gold hydrothermal system considered for the formation of lode-gold deposits in the Ahafo gold district are transport (pathway) and trap processes (physical and chemical). The associated constituent processes and mappable targeting criteria (spatial proxies) from the available geoscience datasets are shown in Table 1\n and discussed below.\n\n\n2.4\nFluid pathways\nAt the regional scale, the D2 and D3 structures (e.g., shear zone, fault) have been interpreted as open and permeable to facilitate and channel the flow of a large volume of hydrothermal fluids throughout the orogenic gold hydrothermal system, from source regions to trap zones (Feybesse et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2019). The NE-striking D2 Kenyase-Yamfo shear zone (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2\na), for example, is a primary tectonostratigraphic contact zone between metavolcanics-granitoids of the Sefwi belt and the adjacent metasediments of the Sunyani-Como\u00e9 basin, along which orogenic gold deposits have been distributed (Feybesse et al., 2006; GMC, 2010; Masurel et al., 2021). In the Ahafo gold district, shear zone hosted ore zones are characterised by disseminated pyrite in close association with higher gold grades (\u223c1.5\u20132.5\u00a0g\/t Au) on steeper-dipping sections of the Kenyase-Yamfo shear zone (Masurel et al., 2021). Thus, proximity to NE-striking faults (i.e. D2 and D3 basement faults) was used as a mappable spatial proxy for fluid pathways.\n\n\n2.5\nPhysical traps\nThe loci into which the metalliferous fluids are focused, and metals precipitate are termed traps (Joly et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2019; Cox et al., 2020). In southwestern Ghana, favourable trap zones developed during the late brittle stages of the D2 to D3 Eburnean tectonic event (Feybesse et al., 2006; Perrouty et al., 2012; McFarlane et al., 2019). During the Eburnean orogeny, late-stage D4 to D5 deformation episodes transformed the compressional regime from NW-SE to NS, causing the NE-striking D2 and D3 thrust faults to reactivate as sinistral strike-slip faults (Feybesse et al., 2006). In the Ahafo district, the N- to NNE-striking faults (D4 faults: McFarlane et al., 2019) are responsible for local bends and sinistral-reverse transpression along the long-lived NE-striking D2 Kenyase-Yamfo fault system with significant displacement\/offset up to \u223c1\u00a0km (Masurel et al., 2021). The offsets caused by the N- to NNE-striking sinistral faults serve as favourable trap zones to focus fluids flowing via the D2 and D3 thrust faults.\nHydrothermal fluids are focused into dilatational zones with high permeability, located in areas with high rock competency contrasts (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Joly et al., 2012; Chudasama et al., 2016). In view of this, lithological contacts with high competency contrast in the Ahafo gold district (e.g., contact between higher-grade granitoids and lower-grade metasediments) were identified as primary traps for metalliferous fluids (Feybesse et al., 2006; Joly et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2019). Thus, proximity to N- to NNE-striking faults, proximity to lithological contacts, and lithological contacts weighted by competency contrast were used as spatial proxies for physical traps.\n\n\n2.6\nChemical traps\nGold deposition in the study area is caused by various processes that alter the physicochemical state of fluids, reducing gold solubility (Hayford et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2019). Changes in redox or Eh\u2013pH conditions, fluid mixing, fluid-wall rock reactions, and change in fluid pressure can cause gold to precipitate from hydrothermal fluids (Joly et al., 2012; Chudasama et al., 2016; Cox et al., 2020). When Fe-rich minerals in the wall rocks react with gold sulphide complexes in the fluids, it leads to desulfidation and breakdown of gold-sulphide complexes (Mikucki, 1998; Joly et al., 2012; Hayford et al., 2013).\nThus, this paper used proximities to the Paleoproterozoic Fe-rich dykes in the study area and lithological contact weighted by chemical reactivity contrast as spatial proxies for chemical traps (Griffis et al., 2002; Chudasama et al., 2016; Tourigny et al., 2019). Other important indicators of chemical deposition are geochemical anomalies and hydrothermal alteration zones (Sun et al., 2019). Favourable hydrothermal alteration zones (potassium enrichment) for the study area were delineated from the available radiometric data (i.e. zones with high K, Th, and U concentrations) (Wilford et al., 1997).\n\n\n\n3\nMethodologies\n\n3.1\nGeoscience datasets\nGhana Geological Survey Authority (GGSA) provided the airborne geophysical (i.e. magnetic and radiometric data with a spatial resolution of 250\u00a0m) and geological datasets. The location of known lode-gold deposits and economic prospects (hereafter referred to as lode-gold occurrences), geological maps, and geophysical technical reports were also accessed from Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL) \u2013 Ahafo and GGSA. Spatial analyses of the evidential layers were carried out using a 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m (0.01\u00a0km2) unit cell size. This pixel size was chosen because the widths of mineralised zones in open pits at the deposit sites, e.g., Subika, Apensu, Awonsu, and Amoma (Fig. 1), are within 100\u00a0m (Masurel et al., 2021). The data processing software used are ArcGIS, Oasis Montaj (Geosoft), and Datamine-Discover.\n\n\n3.2\nProcessing the magnetic data\nMagnetic anomalies of geological structures (e.g., shear zones, faults) emanate from various sources. When the sources of these anomalies are closely spaced, the anomalies can interfere. Also, weak and strong anomalies can develop in regions with overlapping sources at different depths (Nasuti et al., 2019). To enhance discontinuities in the total magnetic intensity (TMI) image (Fig. 3\n\na) and delineate structures, the following edge enhancement techniques were used: (i) analytic signal amplitude (ASA) transform (Rajagopalan, 2003); (ii) first vertical derivative (1VD) filter (Cooper and Cowan, 2004); (iii) tilt derivative (TDR) transform (Miller and Singh, 1994); and (iv) TAHG transform (i.e. using the total horizontal gradient magnitude in the TDR equation) (Ferreira et al., 2013).\nLow-latitude magnetic anomalies (i.e., inclinations within 20\u00b0 of the magnetic equator) have an asymmetric form due to the dipolar nature of the magnetic field, resulting in a horizontal shift between observed anomalies and causative sources (Rajagopalan, 2003). The ASA filter (Fig. 3\nb), which is independent of the magnetisation direction, was applied to the TMI (Fig. 3\na) to shift magnetic anomalies directly over their sources and to enhance anomalies (e.g., NS trending dykes) in the study area. The 1VD filter was used to remove long-wavelength features from the TMI imageand improve the resolution of linear NE-trending anomalies associated with the Kenyase-Yamfo and Hwidiem shear zones (Fig. 3\nc) better than the ASA filter (Fig. 3\nb). The TDR filter (Fig. 3\nd) was used to enhance the amplitude and discontinuity of the TMI anomalies (Fig. 3\na)., It provided an effective means of delineating N- to NNE-striking faults and NS trending dykes (e.g., the dykes located at the northern end of Fig. 3\nd). The maximum value of the TAHG filter (Fig. 3\ne) (which is effective in normalising anomalies from both shallow and deep sources; Nasuti et al., 2019) was used applied to the TMI image to detect the centres and edges of magnetic anomalies associated with the Kenyase-Yamfo and Hwidiem shear zones.\nThe Centre for Exploration Targeting (CET) grid analysis (Holden et al., 2012) was performed on the TMI image to extract magnetic structures (e.g., faults). This grid analysis detects anomalous signal discontinuities and analyses structural association to locate intersections, junctions, and direction changes in the strike. The processing steps (phase symmetry parameter: filter wavelength\u00a0=\u00a04, filter scale\u00a0=\u00a03, robustness\u00a0=\u00a05, orientation\u00a0=\u00a0N, NE; and amplitude parameter: threshold\u00a0=\u00a00.1) used to extract the structures shown in Fig. 3\nf (i.e. structures are superimposed on the phase symmetry of magnetic anomalies) include (Montaj, 2012):\nTexture analysis; is used to estimate the standard deviation of the input grid by analysing regions of subdued magnetic responses. Features of significance (e.g., regions of discontinuity) show high variability.\nLineament detection; is used to generate the phase symmetry of the grid and detect line-like features. A line-like feature displays a strong symmetry response.\nAmplitude threshold; is used to extract the maxima of the phase symmetry grid image (low values are suppressed whilst points of local maxima are preserved).\nSkeletonisation and vectorisation; are used to extract lineaments of the amplitude threshold grid image.\n\nFig. 4\n is a structural map interpreted from the edge enhancement techniques and CET grid analysis. Delineation of the structures and their associated deformation events were guided by field observations from McFarlane et al. (2019) and Masurel et al. (2021).\n\n\n3.3\nProcessing the radiometric data\nThe zones of mineralisation along shear zones (e.g., Kenyase-Yamfo, Hwidiem) and contacts of the volcano-plutonic domains within the Sefwi belt have undergone intense hydrothermal processes (e.g., potassic, sericitisation, chloritisation, silicification, sulphidation) (Griffis et al., 2002). In the Ahafo gold district, hydrothermal alteration is zoned, with distal chlorite-sericite grading into proximal silica-albite-Fe-carbonate mineral assemblages (Masurel et al., 2021). Regions with higher potassium (K) extracted from gamma-ray spectrometric data were used to identify hydrothermal alteration zones (e.g. sericitisation) (Wilford et al., 1997; de Quadros et al., 2003). Potassium (K) (Fig. 5\n\na), equivalent uranium (eU) (Fig. 5\nb), and equivalent thorium (eTh) (Fig. 5\nc) are the three radioelement concentrations that were processed into ratio and ternary maps (Wilford et al., 1997; Dent et al., 2013) to identify zones with high K-enrichment (Shives et al., 1997; de Quadros et al., 2003). In order to achieve this, elevated K values related to hydrothermal alteration had to be separated from that of lithology and weathering through the following procedure: The radiometric ternary RGB image (Fig. 5\nd) was generated to highlight anomalous hydrothermal alteration zones by assigning the following parameters to the following channels (de Quadros et al., 2003): (i) Red channel: \n\n\nK\nd\n\n\n = (K map -\n\n\n\n\nK\n\ni\n\n\n) \/\n\n\n\nK\ni\n\n\n where \n\n\nK\ni\n\n\n = (K map average \/ eTh map average)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0eTh map; (ii) Green channel: F parameter\u00a0=\u00a0K map \u00d7 (eTh map\/eU map); and (iii) Blue channel: K map\/eTh map ratio. The \n\n\nK\ni\n\n\n is the \u2018ideal thorium-defined potassium\u2019 value for each station having measured thorium values; and \n\n\nK\nd\n\n\n is the deviations (anomalies) of measured values of K from ideal calculated values of K (i.e.\n\n\n\nK\ni\n\n\n); and the F parameter defines the abundance of measured K related to eTh\/eU ratio (de Quadros et al., 2003). The three maps (i.e. Kd, F parameter, and K\/eTh ratio) were then combined in a principal component (PC) analysis, with the first PC image (PC1) (Fig. 5\ne) showing the most variance (see Table 2\n). High PC1 image values were identified as hydrothermal alteration zones (K-enrichment) (Fig. 5\nf) after accumulations of K-alteration in the rivers were masked using river channels in the study area.\n\n\n3.4\nGIS-based prospectivity mapping\nThe GIS-based MPM approaches, which utilise geo-registered exploration datasets (with or without deposit locations), are mainly based on empirical mathematical models of the spatial correlation between the targeting criteria (represented by evidential layers\/predictor maps) and the sought-after mineral deposit (Joly et al., 2012). This paper employed multi-index overlay and fuzzy logic models for prospectivity mapping in the study area.\n\n\n\n4\nEvidential layers for prospectivity mapping\n\n4.1\nEvidential layer for the pathway\nDuring the Eburnean orogeny, the critical pathways which acted as permeable structures to transport mineralised fluids from source to trap zones are D2 NE-striking faults (Feybesse et al., 2006; Masurel et al., 2021). The orientations of these faults in the Ahafo district are well understood from available geological and geophysical data (Griffis et al., 2002; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021). Therefore, the evidential layer created for the pathway is proximity to NE- to ENE-striking faults (Annexe 1a).\n\n\n4.2\nEvidential layers for physical traps\nThe deep-seated NE-striking sinistral faults are cross-cut by N- to NNE-striking faults, which truncate NE-striking faults and cause significant offsets (Masurel et al., 2021). Mineralised fluids migrating through NE-striking faults can be tapped and directed to trap zones by these steep-dipping N- to NNE-striking faults. The mineralisation within the structural domain in the Ahafo district (e.g., Awonsu, Apensu, and Amoma) has been observed to occur close to these faults (Feybesse et al., 2006; Masurel et al., 2021). During the Eburnean deformation, the juxtaposition of competent (e.g., higher-grade granitoids) and incompetent (e.g., lower-grade metasediment) lithological units resulted in varying competency contrast along lithological transition zones (Feybesse et al., 2006). Hydrothermal fluids migrate into dilatational zones enhanced in areas associated with high competency contrast and high-fracture-related permeability (Joly et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2020). Therefore, lithological contact weighted by competency contrast can be used as a spatial proxy for a favourable physical trap. Using the approach from Joly et al. (2012), the estimated (relative) rheology strength values from selected rocks in Brown (2002) were attributed to the lithological units. The differences in rheology values were attributed to each unit cell at the contact of the lithological units, up to a maximum distance of 1\u00a0km. The evidential layers created for physical traps are: (i) proximity to N- to NNE-striking faults (Annexe 1b); (ii) proximity to lithological contact (Annexe 1c); (iii) proximity to the intersection of N- to NNE- and NE-strike faults (Annexe 1d); (iv) fault density of NNE- and NE-strike faults (Annexe 1e); and (v) competency contrast across lithological contacts (Annexe 1f).\n\n\n4.3\nEvidential layers for chemical traps\nThe precipitation of gold from hydrothermal fluids into an environment with favourable geochemistry involves changes in the geochemical composition of fluids (e.g., changes in pH, changes in fugacities of oxygen, and temperature change; Hayford et al., 2013). Gold destabilisation and precipitation can occur when redox reactions take place between soluble gold complexes in hydrothermal fluids and Fe-rich rocks (Chudasama et al., 2016). Fluid interaction with highly reactive rocks in areas associated with intense shearing can influence high probabilities of gold deposition (Joly et al., 2012; Hayford et al., 2013). Therefore, lithological contact weighted by chemical reactivity contrast can be a spatial proxy for a favourable chemical trap. Using the approach from Joly et al. (2012), the estimated (relative) reactivity values from selected rocks in Brown (2002) were attributed to the lithological units. The differences in chemical reactivity values were attributed to each unit cell at the contact of the lithological units, up to a maximum distance of 1\u00a0km. The evidential layers created for the chemical traps are: (i) proximity to Fe-rich dykes (Annexe 2a); (ii) reactivity contrast across lithological contacts (Annexe 2b); and (iii) proximity to alteration zone (K-enrichment) (Annexe 2c).\n\n\n4.4\nFuzzy logic modelling\nThe fuzzy model is expressed in a general form as (An et al., 1991; Bonham-Carter, 1994; Joly et al., 2012): If Y is a set of m evidential layers, \n\n\n\nY\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n (i is from 1 to m) having d classes denoted generically as \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n(j is from 1 to d), then n fuzzy sets \n\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n in Y, having favourable evidential patterns for the sought-after mineral deposit is:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n,\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n(\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\nY\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n(\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n) is the membership function to estimate the fuzzy membership value (0 to 1) of \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n in the fuzzy set \n\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n. The membership function of \n\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n takes a Gaussian, sigmoid, triangular, parabolic, or other appropriate function. A linear fuzzy function was chosen for this research in the form (Joly et al., 2012):\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u00d7\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\nj\n\n\n\u00d7\nc\n\n\nf\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\/\n1000\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\ncs\n\nj\n\n\n, \n\n\nm\ni\n\n\n, \n\n\n\ncf\n\ni\n\n\n are class score, evidential layer weight, and confidence factor, respectively.\nIn this fuzzy logic approach, the evidential layers (Annexe 1 and 2) were discretised and classified. Each of the classified layers and related classes was assigned weight and scores, respectively (Table 3\n), based on experts' understanding of the geological setting and the importance of a layer to lode-gold mineralisation in the study area. The weight and scores were on a scale of 1 (least favourable) to 9 (highly favourable). The confidence factor (Table 3) was based on the layer\u2019s degree of representativeness (e.g., how well can a mappable targeting criterion be identified in a geoscience dataset; cf. McCuaig et al., 2010). As a result, if an evidential layer directly reflects a targeting criterion (e.g., proximity to NE-striking D2 faults), it is assigned a higher confidence factor. On the other hand, an evidential layer is assigned a lower confidence factor if it was generated based on an indirect response to a targeting criterion (e.g., competency contrast along lithological transition zones; the values were interpreted from relative values and not directly measured). Using Eq. (2), the fuzzy membership values for the evidential layers, as summarised in Table 3, were calculated from \nm\n, \ncs\n, and \ncf\n. High fuzzy membership values close to 1 were assigned to favourable classes, whereas low fuzzy membership values close to 0 were assigned to least favourable classes.\n\n\n4.5\nFuzzy operators to combine fuzzified evidential layers\nThe fuzzy prospectivity map was created by combining fuzzified evidential layers (Table 3) through fuzzy AND, fuzzy OR, and fuzzy GAMMA (\n\n\u03b3\n\n) operations (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Sadeghi and Khalajmasoumi, 2015). The fuzzy OR operator was used to merge the various fuzzy evidential layers in Table 1 representing physical and chemical traps. The operator created a single fuzzy evidential layer for each trap component. The fuzzy OR operator was chosen because the combined membership value at a location is only limited by the most suitable evidential layers (Bonham-Carter, 1994). In the next step, the two fuzzy evidential layers for each trap component are merged using the fuzzy AND operator to create a single fuzzy evidential layer for traps. This operator was used because it gives a logical intersection of the input layers (i.e. intersection of physical and chemical trap zones) (Nyk\u00e4nen et al., 2008). With the fuzzy AND operator, the combined membership value would be determined at each location by the lowest of the fuzzy membership values (Bonham-Carter, 1994). The final step involves merging the fuzzified evidential layers for pathway and traps using the fuzzy GAMMA operator with a \n\n\u03b3\n\n parameter value of 0.85 (This value was subjectively selected after several values were tested). The fuzzy GAMMA operator increases and decreases the influence of the fuzzy evidential layers (i.e. by adjusting the \n\n\u03b3\n\n parameter value between 0 and 1) used to generate the fuzzy prospectivity map (Nyk\u00e4nen et al., 2008).\n\n\n4.6\nMulti-index overlay modelling\nThe classical index overlay with multi-class evidential layers involves (Bonham-Carter, 1994): (i) discretising the layers into some arbitrary classes; (ii) subjectively assigning different weights to the layers; and (iii) integrating the weighted layers to generate a prospectivity map. A score of \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n is assigned to each of the j-th classes of the i-th discretised evidential layer based on the relative importance of the layer to the sought-after mineral deposit.\n\n\n\nW\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n (which signifies the importance of the layers relative to one another) is the weight subjectively assigned to each discretised evidential layer. The weighted discretised layers are integrated to generate a mineral prospectivity map by using the equation below (i.e Eq. (3)). This equation computes an average weighted score (\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n) for each pixel of the prospectivity map (Bonham-Carter, 199).\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\ni\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in this paper, the discrete values (i.e. layer class in Table 3) of the evidential layers are transformed to continuous values (see Annexe 3 and 4) ranging between [0, 1] by using the \u2018Large and Small\u2019 logistic membership functions (Tsoukalas and Uhrig, 1997; Nyk\u00e4nen et al., 2008):\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n1\n\n1\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nf\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n is the membership corresponding to the value of variable \u00d7,\n\n\nf\n1\n\n\n is the spread, and \n\n\nf\n2\n\n\n is the mid-point where the membership is 0.5. The shape of the function is controlled by these variables, with the spread being positive and negative for Small and Large functions, respectively. The mid-point was set to the mean value of the class scores of each evidential layer and the value of 3 was used to define the spread. For instance, a mid-point value of 1750\u00a0m was selected for proximity layers because most of the known gold deposits and prospects in the study area are discovered within 2\u00a0km of the major shear zones and faults (Griffis et al., 2002; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021). The logistic function is used to mitigate systemic error resulting from discretising continuous-valued spatial evidence using expert opinion in knowledge-driven MPM approaches (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015).\nThe transformed layers are assigned objective weights (i.e. weighted without using expert judgement) by using prediction-area plot and normalised density (i.e. the ratio of prediction rate of a class of evidential values to its corresponding occupied area). Finally, the weighted transformed layers were integrated to generate a prospectivity map by using Eq. (5), which is a data-driven multi-index overlay function adapted from Eq. (3) (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015):\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\nv\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n\nE\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n\nE\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nOM\n\n\nIO\n\n\n\n is the data-driven multi-index overlay score for every pixel in the study area, and \n\n\nT\n\nvi\n\n\n\n is a pixel value in an evidential layer i transformed by a logistic function. The \n\n\nW\n\nEi\n\n\n\n is the weight of evidential layer i, assigned using a prediction-area plot and normalised density as described below.\n\n\n4.7\nConcentration-area fractal model\nIn order to generate prediction-area (P-A) plots, the input transformed evidential layers in the data-driven multi-index overlay function (Eq. (5)) have to be discretised. The concentration-area (C-A) fractal model proposed by Cheng et al. (1994) was applied to discretise and classify the continuous values of transformed evidential layers (see Annexe 3 and 4). Fractal models have been employed in geosciences to explain the spatial distributions of geological features (Cheng and Agterberg, 1995; Raines, 2008). The empirical model for the prospectivity value, \u03c1 and the area A(\u03c1) extent of a prospectivity value follows a power-law relation given as (Sadeghi et al., 2014; Hoang and Nguyen, 2016):\n\n(6)\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\u2264\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\u221d\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n-\n\u03b1\n1\n\n\n;\nA\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\u2265\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\u221d\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n-\n\u03b1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere A(\u03c1) defines the area with prospectivity values greater than or equal to \u03c1 (which is a pixel value); \n\n\u03bd\n\n represents the threshold; \n\n\u03b1\n1\n\n and \n\n\u03b1\n2\n\n are minimum and maximum characteristic exponents. Multiplying the number of cells enclosed within the prospective area by a pixel value greater than \u03c1 equals the area A(\u03c1) for a given \u03c1. The break between line segments on a log\u2013log plot of cumulative area versus corresponding prospectivity pixel value represents the threshold to classify prospectivity classes (e.g., Sadeghi et al., 2014; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015; Forson et al., 2020). The discretised values used to classify the transformed evidential layers are summarised in Table 4\n. These classes were then used to construct the P-A plots (see Annexe 3 and 4).\n\n\n4.8\nPrediction-area plot and normalised density\nThe prediction-area (P-A) plot (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015) involves plotting three parameters on the same graph: (i) the discretised classes of a layer; (ii) the probability (in percentage) of known mineral occurrence predicted by each discretised class to total mineral occurrence; and (iii) the corresponding area (in percentage) occupied by each discretised class to the total study area. The point where the two curves intersect indicates two things; (1) the prediction success rate (\n\n\nP\nr\n\n\n) of known mineral occurrences predicted by the prospectivity map; and (2) the percentage of the area (\n\n\nO\na\n\n\n) relative to the total study area, that corresponds to this prediction success rate.\nThe normalised density (\n\n\nN\nd\n\n\n) of a layer is defined as a ratio of prediction success rate (\n\n\nP\nr\n\n\n) to the corresponding occupied area (\n\n\nO\na\n\n\n) obtained from the intersection point in the P-A plots (Mihalasky and Bonham-Carter, 2001; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015):\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\nE\n\n\n=\n\nl\n\n\nn\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nW\n\n\nE\n\n\n\n is the objective weight (i.e. natural logarithm of normalised density) assigned to the transformed evidential layer whose discretised form was used to generate the P-A plot. The P-A plot and the normalised density served as a data-driven way to assign objective weights to evidential layers, compared to using expert judgment to assign subjective weights to layers in the classical index overlay method for knowledge-driven MPM (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). The extracted parameters from the intersection point on the P\u2013A plots, normalised density, and objective weight for each transformed evidential layer are summarised in Table 4. Each transformed evidential layer and the associated weight in Table 4 were combined using Eq. (5) to generate the multi-index overlay prospectivity map.\n\n\n4.9\nFry analysis of lode-gold occurrence in the study area\nThe metallogenic trends of known mineral occurrences can be established using a technique known as Fry analysis (Fry, 1979; Vearncombe and Vearncombe, 1999). This technique is a point pattern analysis approach that uses the spacing between all objects\/points in distribution to get interpretable outcomes even for a limited number of points (e.g., mineral occurrences) (Fry, 1979; de Palomeraa and Carranza, 2005). The spatial distribution of lode-gold occurrences in the study area was analysed using Fry analysis to deduce favourable structural trends influencing lode-gold mineralisation (Joly et al., 2012). The Fry analysis was performed with 18 points, each indicating the approximate spatial location of a known orogenic gold deposit and prospect in the Ahafo gold district. The Fry plot and rose diagram of the translation points were generated to analyse the spatial distribution and association of the mineral occurrences with another, and highlight significant trends in their distribution (Vearncombe and Vearncombe, 1999; Joly et al., 2012; Chudasama et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n5\nResults and discussions\nThere are several GIS-based MPM integrated approaches available for creating prospectivity maps with significant prediction strength for mineral deposits (Bonham-Carter, 1994; Carranza and Hale, 2001; Joly et al., 2012; Sadeghi et al., 2014; Sadeghi and Khalajmasoumi, 2015; Chudasama et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). Prospectivity maps from the multi-index overlay and fuzzy logic models used to identify potential zones for lode-gold mineralisation in the Ahafo gold district, are discussed below.\n\n5.1\nMulti-index overlay and fuzzy prospectivity maps\nThe multi-index overlay and fuzzy prospectivity maps with continuous prospectivity scores generated for the Ahafo gold district are shown in Fig. 6\n\na and Fig. 7\n\na. The concentration-area (C-A) fractal models (Fig. 6\nb and Fig. 7\nb) were used to discretise and classify the continuous prospectivity scores. The discretised multi-index overlay and fuzzy prospectivity maps with discrete prospectivity scores are shown in Fig. 6\nc and Fig. 7\nc, respectively. On the discretised prospectivity maps (Fig. 6\nc and Fig. 7\nc), the scores (Classes) represent zones with varying degrees of suitability for lode-gold mineralising processes. The potential zones corresponding to Class 6 and Class 1 were considered as the first and least priority zones for lode-gold mineralisation, respectively. The potential zones represented as Class 5, Class 4, Class 3, and Class 2 were considered as second, third, fourth, and fifth priority zones, respectively. With regards to the study area (2151.56\u00a0km2), the cumulative area for Class 6 and Class 5 is 466.08\u00a0km2 (21.66\u00a0%) in Fig. 6\nc (multi-index overlay prospectivity map) and 753.43\u00a0km2 (35.01\u00a0%) in Fig. 7\nc (fuzzy prospectivity map).\nThe prospectivity maps (Fig. 6\nc and Fig. 7\nc) delineated potential zones along the Kenyase-Yamfo shear zone (KYSZ): (i) zone 2 and 3, which are located at the contact between the metasediments and metamorphose basalts; (ii) zones 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12, which are located at the contact between metasediments and granitoid (diorite-granodiorite-tonalite); and (iii) zones 13 and 15, which are located at the contact between the metasediment and metamorphosed volcaniclastic rocks. The discretised fuzzy prospectivity map (Fig. 7\nc) delineated large potential zones at these lithological contacts because of the high weights assigned to the evidential layers for competency contrast and proximity to lithological contacts (Table 3). The transition zones of these lithological units are dominated by faults and fractures that enhance permeability in incompetent rocks and direct fluid flow into newly formed fractures\/stockworks (Chudasama et al., 2016; Takyi-Kyeremeh et al., 2019). This influenced the decision to assign high weights to these evidential layers (i.e. competency contrast and proximity to lithological contacts) in the fuzzy logic model. However, the discretised multi-index overlay prospectivity map (Fig. 6\nc) delineated relatively smaller potential zones at the aforementioned lithological contacts due to low weights objectively assigned to layers for lithological contact, competency and reactivity contrasts (Table 4).\nThe northern part of the study area, which is dominated by metasediments (e.g., graywacke sediment dominant), granitoid (biotite-granites and two-mica leucogranites), and Fe-rich dykes, has some very high potential zones (e.g., zones 13, 16, 17, and 18) in Fig. 6\nc and Fig. 7\nc. This region host multiple NE-strike faults and cross-cutting N- to NNE-strike sinistral faults, resulting in a high fault density (Fig. 4 and Annexe 1e). High competency contrast was calculated at the contact of the metasediments and granitoid, whereas high reactivity contrast was calculated at the contact of the metasediments and dykes. In contrast to the multi-index overlay model, the fuzzy logic modelling (Fig. 7c) delineated large potential zones for this part of the study area. This is because high fault density of NE- and N- to NNE-strike faults, proximity to Fe-rich dykes, high competency, and reactivity contrasts were regarded as favourable indicators for trap processes, which influenced the decision to assign high weights to the evidential layers of these proxies (Table 3). However, the potential zones 17 and 18 are relatively small on the discretised multi-index overlay prospectivity map (Fig. 6\nc) because the evidential layers for competency and reactivity contrast were objectively assigned low weights, whereas the proximity to dykes had no weight (Table 4). High potential zones (i.e. zones 1, 4, and 5) are identified in the southwestern part of the prospectivity maps (Fig. 6\nc and Fig. 7\nc). The potential zone 5 is associated with the Hwidiem shear zone (HSZ).\nThe P-A plot and normalised density used to assign objective weights to layers (e.g., density of NE and N to NNE faults, proximity to Fe-rich dykes, competency contrasts, and reactivity contrasts) in Table 4, were adopted as a data driven approach to evaluate and rank layers based on the relative importance of each layer to predict potential zones for lode-gold mineralisation in a study area (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). For example, while the presence of Fe-rich dykes was considered a good indicator of chemical trap processes in the fuzzy logic model, its evidential layer was removed from the multi-index overlay model because the P-A plot and normalised density approach identified this layer as an inefficient indicator (i.e. weight\u00a0=\u00a00) of gold mineralisation at the scale of the study area. However, at the deposit scale, Masurel et al. (2021) indicated a definite (positive) spatial association between economic gold mineralisation and shallow-dipping mafic dikes and shear zones at Apensu, Awonsu, and Subika. As a result, the inclusion of evidential layers in the knowledge-driven MPM approach at the scale of the study area should be based not only on the quantitative function or conceptual model of the deposit-type sought but also on the significant genetic link between the layers and the mineralisation type sought on a scale-basis (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015).\nThe Fry plot (Vearncombe and Vearncombe, 1999) for 18 lode-gold occurrences (Fig. 8\n\na) in the study area is shown in Fig. 8\nb. The predominant direction of the point translations in the rose diagram (Fig. 8\nc) has an azimuth of 40\u00b0\u201350\u00b0. However, there are secondary orientations of point translations with azimuths between 0\u00b0\u201310\u00b0 and 15\u00b0\u201325\u00b0, whereas minor orientations trend 50\u00b0\u201360\u00b0. The point pattern and azimuth frequencies from the Fry plot (Fig. 8\nb) and rose diagram (Fig. 8\nc), respectively, suggest that the structures with NE-SW directions are predominant in controlling most of the lode-gold mineralisation. The NE\u2013SW trend can be linked to the D2 to D3 thrust faults, which tend to have a significant influence on lode-gold mineralisation in the Ahafo district, as per geological mapping, drill core logging, and 3D structural models (McFarlane et al., 2019; Masurel et al., 2021). However, there is significant control of mineralisation by NS to NNE-SSW trending structures (D4 deformation faults) in the Ahafo gold district (Masurel et al., 2021) with two predominant orientations, 0\u00b0\u201310\u00b0 and 15\u00b0\u201325\u00b0. These NS to NNE-SSW faults (tear faults; Masurel et al., 2021) are aslant to the Sefwi belt-Sunyani basin margin (which host the Kenyase-Yamfo shear zone in the study area, Fig. 4) and are considered by Masurel et al. (2021) to give the most relevant structural geometry in terms of predictive exploration in the Ahafo gold camp. Almost all known gold deposits (e.g., Subika, Apensu, Awonso, Awoma) and gold occurrences in the Ahafo South camp are confined between a pair of these tear faults and within 2\u00a0km of the crustal-scale Kenyase-Yamfo shear zone (Masurel et al., 2021).\nThe prospectivity maps (Fig. 6 a, c) generated by the multi-index overlay model predicted potential lode-gold mineralisation zones oriented in the following directions: (i) NE, which can be related to NE-SW sinistral faults (D2 to D3 deformation; McFarlane et al., 2019), and (ii) N to NNE (e.g., zones 6, 8, 10, 14, and 19), which can be related to NS to NNE-SSW-strike faults (related to late Eburnean D4 deformation; McFarlane et al., 2019). The subjective approach of the fuzzy logic model, which assigned a high weight to the evidential layer for the NE-strike sinistral faults (Table 3), can be ascribed to have influenced the predominant NE-strike direction of the prospective zones in the fuzzy logic prospectivity maps (Fig. 7a, c). On the discretised multi-index overlay prospectivity map (Fig. 6\nc), the nine known orogenic gold deposits (e.g., Subika, Apensu, Amoma, Yamfo, Susuan, and Teekyere; Fig. 1) in the district are spatially located at high potential zones (i.e. zones 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15). The lode-gold deposits at Subika, Awonsu, Apensu, and Amoma are mined by Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (open pit, average 1\u20132.5\u00a0g\/t Au; Masurel et al., 2021).\n\n\n5.2\nEvaluation of the prospectivity models\nThe prospective zones delineated by the GIS-based MPM approaches can be evaluated using the spatial distribution of known mineral deposits, prospects, or occurrences in the study area (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). In order to evaluate the discretised prospectivity maps, the spatial locations of 18 lode-gold occurrences (deposits and economic prospects) within the Ahafo gold district were used in a prediction-area (P-A) plot. The spatial locations of the lode-gold occurrences were superimposed on the discretised prospectivity maps to determine the capture efficiency of the maps (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015; Du et al., 2016; Forson et al., 2020).\nThe P-A plots generated for the discretised multi-index overlay and fuzzy prospectivity maps are shown in Fig. 6\nd and Fig. 7\nd, respectively. The intersection point in Fig. 6\nd and Fig. 7\nd indicates that the multi-index overlay and fuzzy logic models predicted 24\u00a0% (516.37\u00a0km2) and 26\u00a0% (559.41\u00a0km2) of the Ahafo gold district (2151.56\u00a0km2) as prospective, respectively, within which 76\u00a0% and 74\u00a0% of the known lode-gold occurrences are delineated. For a P-A plot, the normalised density is the ratio of the percentage of mineral occurrences to the percentage of the area mapping the mineral occurrences (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). The classes of prospectivity maps with normalised densities greater than one (>1) are good predictors of mineralised sites or zones (Mihalasky and Bonham-Carter, 2001; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015). Thus, the normalised densities for the discretised multi-index overlay and fuzzy prospectivity maps calculated from the P-A plots are 3.16 and 2.84, respectively. The normalised densities of the prospectivity maps are\u00a0>\u00a01, which suggests that the maps are good predictors of mineralised zones that could help in deciding areas to target for further exploration studies in the Ahafo gold district. Even though the prospectivity maps indicate that the central and northern parts of the Ahafo gold district have more potential zones for lode-gold mineralisation, the multi-class index overlay prospectivity map is preferred over the fuzzy logic prospectivity map because it delineates smaller prospective areas and has a higher prediction success rate than the latter.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nFuzzy logic and multi-index overlay methods were used to assess the lode-gold potential in the Ahafo gold district of the Sefwi granite-greenstone belt, Ghana. The geoscience datasets used were: (i) geological map of 1: 140 000; (ii) high-resolution airborne magnetic and radiometric data (250\u00a0m); and (iii) deposits and economic prospects occurrence data. Using these datasets, the following evidential layers were generated to be used as input in the modelling: (i) proximity to NE-striking basement faults; (ii) proximity to N- to NNE-strike fault; (iii) proximity to litho-contacts; (iv) proximity to the intersection of N- to NNE- and NE-strike faults; (v) density of N- to NNE- and NE-strike faults; (vi) litho-competency contrast; (vii) proximity to Fe-rich dykes; (viii) litho-reactivity contracts; and (ix) proximity to potassium-rich alteration zone. The integration of these layers using the above mentioned GIS-based MPM models resulted in prospectivity maps for the study area. Favourable potential zones for lode-gold mineralisation were identified along the Kenyase-Yamfo and Hwidiem shear zones. There are also considerable potential zones along the metavolcanic-granitoid-metasediment contact zones.\nThe prediction-area plot for discretised multi-index overlay prospectivity map predicted 76\u00a0% of the known lode-gold occurrences with 24\u00a0% of the study area as prospective, whereas that for the discretised fuzzy prospectivity map was 74\u00a0% with 26\u00a0% of the study area as prospective. The Fry analysis helped gain an intuitive understanding of the primary district-scale structural controls on lode-gold mineralisation in the study area. According to the Fry analysis, most of the mineral occurrence and high prospectivity areas are associated with NE-SW structural trends (i.e. 40\u00b0\u201350\u00b0) (D2 and D3 deformation). However, there is a secondary structural trend in the NS to NNE-SSW direction (D4 deformation) with two significant orientations at the district scale (i.e. 0\u00b0\u201310\u00b0 and 15\u00b0\u201325\u00b0).\nThe prospectivity maps show that majority of the known lode-gold deposits (e.g., Subika, Apensu, Awonsu, Amoma, Yamfo, Susuan, Teekyere, and Subenso) are spatially located in high potential zones. However, the multi-class index overlay prospectivity map, in terms of area, delineated smaller zones than the fuzzy prospectivity map. This implies that the multi-index overlay approach used in this paper is more conservative than the fuzzy logic approach. The logistic functions, prediction-area (P-A) plots, and normalised density (\n\n\nN\nd\n\n\n) used in the multi-index overlay modelling helped avoid assigning an arbitral threshold value or integers to the evidential layers. By using the P-A plot and \n\n\nN\nd\n\n\n to generate objective weights, the subjective approach of assigning weights to evidential layers in classical index overlay knowledge-driven MPM can be avoided. The P-A plot and \n\n\nN\nd\n\n\n were further used to assess the efficiency of the evidential layers and their relevance to lode-gold mineralisation in the study. The multi-class index overlay approach employed in this paper is preferred over the fuzzy logic approach, based on the results of the analyses and the size of the area identified as potential zones in each prospectivity map.\n\n","3":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIn China, many famous deposits in the long-term resource mining, shallow ore resources have been gradually exhausted; therefore, exploration for deep resources must be solved urgently. Realizing the comprehensive evaluation of deep ore resources effectively, economically, and rapidly has become the frontier field of mineral exploration research. Tectono-geochemical anomalies, as a chemical exploration method, can provide valuable informations for the deep mineralization information of ore deposits and play an increasingly important role in mineral exploration (e.g., Kelley et al., 2006; Cameron et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2010; Talebi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012; Han et al., 2019a, 2019b; Gonalves and Mateus, 2019), which can closely link the core problems of metallogenic space and the distribution, migration, dispersion and the enrichment of geochemical elements that trouble geological prospecting (e.g., Tu, 1984; Han et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Parsa et al., 2016; Farahbakhsh et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). Specifically, the processes of it include metallotectonic analysis, field mapping, drawing anomaly map, extracting and interpreting weak information, optimizing located targets, etc., (Han et al., 2015). Consequently, identifying the true mineralization-induced geochemical anomalies from disturbing factors and delineating potential mineralization areas (Cohen et al., 2010). Thereby the methods of mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0two standard deviations, probability graphs, boxplots, Q-Q plots and fractals have been used to define anomalous areas (Zhao and Wang, 2021). The migration and accumulation of ore-forming materials can be deduced from tectono-geochemical anomalies. At the same time, the distribution features of primary anomalies can be indicated by mineralizing cluster analysis and factor-score values (Han et al., 2015). Cluster analysis can be used to explore the combination regularities, and factor analysis can reveal the genetic relationship between elements. Combined with the metallogenic geological background, the evolution characteristics of elements in mineralization are infered, which provides the basis for the prediction of concealed orebodies (e.g., Han et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Zhao and Wang, 2021). Based on it, this method has played an important role in the exploration of deep concealed deposits (orebodies) and has become the main technology for evaluating Cu, Pb\u2013Zn (Ge), Sb and other polymetallic deposits (e.g., Han et al., 2001, 2010,2019b; Wang et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2014; Zhao and Wang, 2021).\nSouthern Hunan province is within a structurally complex area where the Qinzhou\u2013Hangzhou overlaps with Nanling metallogenic belts, resulting in the characteristic widespread distribution of Jurassic and Cretaceous granites in the area and the formation of numerous polymetallic deposits, which related to magmatic\u2013hydrothermal fluids (Mao et al., 2013; Ni et al., 2021). Several world-class large\u2013superlarge polymetallic deposits, such as the Shizhuyuan W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi (Wu et al., 2019), Yaogangxian W (Li et al., 2018), Furong Sn (Jiang, 2006), Xintianling W (Yuan et al., 2012) have been distributed. This area contains Pb, Zn, Cu, W, Sn, Mo, Li, Be, rare-earth elements (REEs), and rare metals (e.g., Rb, Nb, Ta) with reserves of>1 million tons of Sn, 2.3 million tons of W, and 10 million tons of Pb\u2013Zn, etc. (Xu et al., 2016). Thus, it has become one of the major producers for Cu\u2013W\u2013Sn\u2013Zn\u2013Pb resources in China. The Huangshaping polymetallic deposit is located in the Southern Hunan province (Li et al., 2017), and is unique in that different types of metals combination are closely related to different metallogenic rocks, e.g., Cu and W\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Sn polymetallic orebodies are controlled by quartz porphyry and granite porphyry, respectively. Since the 1950\u00a0s, many studies have been undertaken on this deposit, including mine geology (e.g., Tong, 1986; Han et al., 2020), sources of ore-forming materials (e.g., Huang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2017), ore genesis (e.g., Gu, 1997; Li et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020), rock and ore geochronology (e.g., Ma et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2010; Li et al.,2017; Li et al.,2019; Jiang et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2020), and metallogenic mechanisms (Zhao et al., 2018; Han et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2022). However, researches on geochemical anomaly in the HangshaPing\u2013Baoshan orefield (also known as Pingbao) are mainly focus on element zoning sequence of stream sediments in shallow surfaces (Luo, 1993; Liu et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2015). Since then, research on the characteristic of deep tectono-geochemical anomalies have been neglected, which seriously restricted the prospecting and exploration of deep concealed orebodies in the deposit.\nAccordingly, in this study, the Huangshaping deposit was selected as a typical case study because it is known for its W\u2013Sn and Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu polymetallic superimposed mineralization, which has potential for further exploration in deep part of deposit. This study focuses on the principal problems of the unclear depth evaluation index and unclear positioning of deep Cu\u2013Sn polymetallic orebodies in the deposit. Based on the research methods for the ore-controlling structure of the hydrothermal deposit spreading pattern (Han and Zhao, 2021). Through the investigation and the same data processing method of different level adits (e.g., \u2212136, \u2212256, \u2212296\u00a0m, etc.), we present a detailed study of the geological characteristics of these two metallogenic systems, geochemical data of tectonites from different level adits to better represent the trace element combination distribution characteristics, and rock data aided in interpreting the geogenic cause of geochemical anomalies. In adition, the depth evaluation index and the deposit\u2019s structural prospecting model were constructed. Finally, the favorable locations of the concealed orebodies for deep exploration was inferred. This study has important implications for enriching the theory of rock- and ore-controlling structures and for further exploration of deep resources in the Pingbao ore field and southern Hunan.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nDuring the Neoproterozoic era (860\u2013780\u00a0Ma), South China Block (SCB) was formed by the collision of the Yangtze Block to the northwest and the Cathaysian Block to the southeast (Fig. 1\na) (Wang et al., 2013). South Hunan is located in the overlapping part of the Qingzhou\u2013Hangzhou belt and the Nanling belt (Fig. 1b, 1c), which makes up the central Nanling region, is characterized by complex geologic conditions and rich mineral resources. It experienced complex tectonic movement in different stages and to varying degrees, accompanied by multi-stage magmatic and metallogenic processes. Among them, the Early Yanshanian activity and and non-ferrous metal mineralization (e.g., W, Sn, Mo, Bi, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Au) are most prominent (Fig. 2\na) (e.g., Guo et al., 1989; Shu and Charvet, 1996; Li et al., 2008, 2009,2010; Zhou et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2007). The basement strata in this region consist of Ediacaran to Ordovician clastic rocks, overlain by Devonian to Triassic carbonates, marls, clastic rocks, and Jurassic to Cretaceous clastic rocks, volcanic rocks and red beds (Fig. 2a) (Mao et al., 2007). The structure in this region is divided into three groups according to the strike, including SN (e.g., Chaling-Chenzhou-Linwu Fault), NNE (e.g., Lingling, Changning\u2013Ningyuan, Zixing, Guidong\u2013Rucheng Faults), NW-trending structures(e.g., Shaoyang\u2013Chenzhou, Lanshan\u2013Xinning, Qiyang\u2013Lingwu Faults) (Wang et al., 2013, Li et al., 2014) (Fig. 1c). The Mesozoic granitoid intrusions in the region are widely distributed, mainly in Jurassic granodiorite, granite porphyry, quartz porphyry, biotite granite etc., which are distributed in these main structures, such as the Chaling-Chenzhou-Linwu Fault controls the distribution of the Qianlishan\u2013Qitianling granitoids (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2b). Complex tectonic-thermo events resulting in the formation of multiple stages of intrusions and associated abundant polymetallic ore deposits. Meanwhile, early granodiorite porphyries (\u223c160\u00a0Ma) associated with Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization, and later granites (\u223c155\u00a0Ma) related to W\u2013Sn mineralization were formed (Fig. 2a) (Ding et al., 2016), which mainly hosted in the Devonian and Carboniferous carbonates. Previous studies suggested that Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization and W\u2013Sn mineralization in southern Hunan were of the same period, which may be related to the same geological event (Han et al., 2019a).\nPingbao orefield located in southern Hunan province and the main strata exposed are dominantly neritic marine sediments, including Silurian, Cambrian, Devonian, Triassic, and Permian to Neogene limestone, shale, sandstone and siltstone (Fig. 2a) (Li et al., 2020). The NNE, NE, NW, EW-trending regional faults and folds are developed (Fig. 2a, 2b). The Jurassic granitic intrusive rocks (dominantly 170\u2013150\u00a0Ma) controlled by them occur as batholiths, laccoliths, stocks and dikes. Skarn-type Cu, W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo-Bi and hydrothermal veins Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu are the main mineralization types. The metallogenic age range 159\u00a0Ma from 154\u00a0Ma according to molybdenite Re\u2013Os geochronology (Ma et al. 2007; Lei et al. 2010).\n\n\n3\nGeology of the Huangshaping W\u2013Mo\u2013Pb\u2013Zn deposit\nThe large Huangshaping W\u2013Mo\u2013Pb\u2013Zn deposit (112\u00b040E, 25\u00b039\u00a0N) is situated\u00a0\u223c\u00a09\u00a0km southwest of Guiyang County, Chenzhou City, southern Hunan Province, central section of the Nanling metallogenic belt (Fig. 1c and 2). To the northeast, it is adjacent to the world-class Qitianling\u2013Qianlishan ore-concentrated area (Fig. 1c). It has been mined since the Tang Dynasty and has accumulated >16 million tons of Zn\u2013Pb ore and produced 1 million tons of Zn\u2013Pb ore metal (Li et al., 2016).\n\n3.1\nStrata and structures\nThe strata in the deposit is dominated by Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary rocks with NNE\u2013SSW or NE\u2013SW trending distribution (Fig. 2b). The Upper Devonian Xikuangshan Formation mainly comprises limestone, dolomitic limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and shale. The Lower Carboniferous system is the most exposed stratum in the mining area, including Douling'ao Formation limestone, Shidengzi Formation limestone, Ceshui Formation sandstone, and Zimenqiao Formation dolomite and limestone. The hydrothermal veined Zn\u2013Pb orebodies are mainly hosted in the Shidengzi Formation limestone, and calc-silicate rocks (e.g., andradite, hedenbergite, diopside) are the main host for W\u2013Mo\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization (Fig. 2b and 3\n).\nHuangshaping deposit controlled by the NE-trending Chenzhou\u2013Linwu and SN-trending Laiyang\u2013Linwu fault belts (Kong et al., 2018). Numerous NNE\u2013SSW-trending folds and fults are the main structures in the mining area. Baoling\u2013Guanyindazuo reverse anticline and Shangyinshan syncline are the main folds. Near SN-trending thrust faults (F1, F2, and F3) and EW\u2013NWW-trending normal faults (F0, F6, and F9) developed in the deposit (Fig. 2b and 3a), which are the results of NW\u2013SE compression in early and middle Yanshannian. These structures control the occurrence of granitoids and the locations of polymetallic orebodies (Han et al. 2020).\nOre-controlling fault F2 is typical in rock-controlling and ore-conducting structures of this deposit (Fig. 4\na). F2 (near SN trending that dip to E at 35\u00b0 to 80\u00b0) is distributed in the eastern part of the mining area, with a fracture zone width of\u00a0\u223c\u00a012\u00a0m (Fig. 4a). Three secondary faults (F2-1, F2-2, and F2-3) can be recognized. Fig. 4 shows the occurrence (75\u00b0, N 200\u00b0 means the dip angle and azimuth are respectively 75\u00b0 and 200\u00b0, same as below). The fault surfaces are wavy or zigzag, with fault striae and steps observed on some fault surfaces, indicating that F2 was reactivated in different periods of tectonic activity. The rocks from F2\u2032s footwall to hangingwall have obvious zoning characteristics (Fig. 4a), including dense massive to stockwork pyrite-galena-sphalerite orebodies (zone I) (Fig. 4b and 4c), veinlet calcitization and pyritization limestone (zone II) (Fig. 4c), grayish-black schistosity cleavage and fault gouge (zone III) (Fig. 4d and 4e), light-gray broken limestone (zone VI), structural breccia, schistosity, lenticular bodies, and gouge (zone V) (Fig. 4f\u2013j) and stockwork calcitization limestone (zone VI) (Fig. 4h\u2013j). Hydrothermal minerals, such as calcite and pyrite, were filled along the joints (Fig. 4a, 4c, 4e, and 4j). Detailed features are shown in Fig. 4. Two stages of tectonic activity can be identified recognized by the surfaces, rock, and cut relationship of faults. Early stage, magmatic and polymetallic mineralization occurred along NWW normal fault, which has the NW\u2013SE-trending principal compressive stress (\u03c31 is about 118\u00b0\/25\u00b0, Fig. 4k). By contrast, in the late stage, the mechanical properties of NW-trending fault has changed to reverse left-lateral fault, cutting the faults and orebodies formed in the early stage. The direction of principal compressive stress is NE\u2013SW-trending (\u03c31 is about 32\u00b0\/41\u00b0, Fig. 4l).\n\n\n3.2\nGranitoids\nThe Late Jurassic intrusions of the Huangshaping deposit mainly include outcropping quartz porphyry, unexposed granophyre and granite porphyry, which are hypabyssal acidic granitoids (Ding et al., 2018). NNE-trending and EW-trending quartz porphyry exposed at the surface that dip to E and N by 50\u00b0 to 70\u00b0, respectively. Phenocrysts of the quartz porphyry are mainly composed of quartz and minor feldspar and biotite. The groundmass of this porphyry also consists of quartz and feldspars, with a felsitic texture, showing a hypabyssal-type characteristic. The granophyre is characterized by a granophyric texture with K-feldspar, quartz and small amounts of plagioclase and biotite as phenocrysts. The groundmass of this porphyry has a micrographic texture (Kong et al., 2018). NNE-trending granite porphyry located in the southeast part of the area that dip to E by 55\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. It occurs with porphyritic or glomerophyric texture and contains phenocrysts of quartz, alkali feldspar, and minor amounts of plagioclase, with fine-grained quartz and feldspar in the groundmass (Gong et al., 2015). Studies have shown that the plutons are high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic igneous rocks (Yao et al., 2005; Li et al., 2014).\nZircon U-Pb ages for the granitoids range from 179.9 to 150.1\u00a0Ma (e.g., Yuan et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2010; Ai, 2013; Quan et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2018) and ore-forming ages from 157.5 to 150.9\u00a0Ma (e.g., Yao et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2010), respectively. This indicates that it occurred in the Middle to Late Jurassic. In particular, NWW- and NEE-trending structures in the region directly control the distribution pattern of granitoids (Fig. 2b and 3a). The occurrences of granitoids and the locations of W\u2013Mo\u2013Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn mineralization are controlled by the main faults and folds. Studies have inferred that the granite porphyry and granophyre were sourced from the same magma batch but experienced different degrees of fractional crystallization (Han et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2010).\n\n\n3.3\nOrebodies\nHuangshaping polymetallic mineralization can be divided into two main types based on mineral assemblages and the occurrence of orebodies, namely, skarn (W\u2013Sn\u2013Bi\u2013Mo) and hydrothermal veins (Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu\u2013Ag). Many studies have shown that Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu and W\u2013Sn orebodies formations are related to quartz porphyry and granite porphyry respectively (Zhu et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2011a; Zhao et al., 2018; Han et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) (Fig. 3). Ore-forming components mainly sourced from granite and leaching of host rocks (Li et al., 2020). Currently, >500 economic orebodies have been identified. Hydrothermal vein-type Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag polymetallic orebodies (veined, stratiform-like, lenticular, and irregular) are mainly hosted in the recrystallized limestone or interlayer fault zone of the Shidengzi Formation (Fig. 4a and 5a). Ore minerals are mainly composed of sphalerite, galena, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrite. Those orebodies have lengths of 100\u00a0m to\u00a0>\u00a0900\u00a0m, and thickness of about 2\u201310\u00a0m with the depth of 40\u00a0m to\u00a0>\u00a0900\u00a0m (Fig. 3b). Pb, Zn, and Cu grading of 1.32\u00a0%, 3.90\u00a0%, and 0.84\u00a0%, respectively (Gong et al., 2015). However, skarn-type orebodies are mainly hosted in the porphyry contact zone and Shidengzi Formation limestone. In the SE part, the No. W216 W\u2013Sn\u2013Bi\u2013Mo orebody group is the most typical, which is about 800\u20131000\u00a0m long, 60\u2013430\u00a0m wide, and\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0m deep (Fig. 3c). The average grade is 0.26\u00a0% for WO3, 0.07\u00a0% for Mo, 0.07\u00a0% for Bi, 0.18\u00a0% for Sn, and 19.60\u00a0% for (FeO\u00a0+\u00a0Fe2O3) (Gong et al., 2015). These orebodies are mostly veins, columnar, lenticular, stratiform-like, and have frequent swelling\u2013shrinking along the trend and dip directions (Fig. 3). Li et al. (2016) concluded that W\u2013Sn ores precipitated at temperatures of\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu ores precipitated at low temperatures of 200\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C. Re\u2013Os geochronology of molybdenite indicates ore-forming ages between 159 and 154\u00a0Ma (Ma et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2010). Ore minerals are molybdenite, bismuthite, scheelite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite. The gangue minerals are mainly fluorite, quartz, garnet, pyroxene, chlorite, calcite, actinolite, idocrase, chlorite, calcic skarn and hornblende.\n\n\n3.4\nAlteration and mineralization zoning\nThe alteration of Huangshaping deposit is mainly skarn and sulfide\u2013carbonate alteration. Skarn is most developed in the contact zone between granitoids and Shidengzi Formation limestones, with the best skarn development around granite porphyry (Fig. 5\n). In this work, the alteration zoning is divided by detailed investigation of the geological characteristics in different level adits (e.g., \u2212256\u00a0m, etc.) (Fig. 5b and 5c). From the altered porphyry to the Shidengzi Formation limestone (outward), this deposit exhibits multiple zones comprised of altered porphyry zone (I)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0diopside\u2013wollastonite\u2013actinolite\u2013epidote\u2013garnet\u2013magnetite skarn zone (II)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0diopside\u2013garnet\u2013fushanite\u2013actinolite\u2013epidote\u2013fluorite\u2013scheelite\u2013molybdenite skarn zone (III)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0marble (or recrystallized limestone)\u2013sulfide zone (IV)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0calcite\u2013sulfide zone (V)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0unaltered limestone zone (VI) (Fig. 5b and 5c). The ore types, alteration intensities, altered mineral assemblages, texture and structure and content of main minerals are different (Table 1\n). From zone I to VI, the alteration intensity gradually weakened. Calc-silicate rocks, silicification were closely related to Fe, Cu, Mo, Sn, W and Bi mineralization in zones II and III, controlled by contact zone. Carbonation and pyritization were closely related to Pb, Zn and Ag mineralization in zone IV, controlled by faults and folds.\n\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical methods of t tectono-geochemical exploration\nIn this study, the typical transverse drifts in different level adits (e.g., \u2212136\u00a0m, \u2212176\u00a0m, \u2212256\u00a0m and\u00a0\u2212296\u00a0m) were selected as the research subjects because they are completely exposure the altered porphyry, mineralized alteration rock and altered limestone, as well as the faults and folds. In the process of large-scale alteration petrographic mapping and strictly control sampling density, samples of tectonites, ores and altered rocks within different alteration zones were collected. Among them, cataclastic rocks, breccias and fault gouges were collected from fault and fracture zones of different transverse drifts. But in host rocks without structures developed, ores and metamorphic rocks (e.g., skarn or marble) were collected to meet the requirements of the sample density for tectonic geochemical mapping.\nIn total, 522 samples were collected from the falut zones and contanct zones in this deposit within an area of about 20\u00a0km2 on each level adit. The structural dot-spacing is about 5\u201310\u00a0m, and the largest sampling distance is no >20\u00a0m. The samples weighed 1\u20132\u00a0kg and were dried at room temperature. All samples were classified, described, and checked in detail. Two samples and one accessory sample were processed, and a ball mill was used to ground one sample to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0200 mesh test samples. Finally, 386 representative samples (e.g., granite porphyry, quartz porphyry, skarn, altered limestone, and tectonites) were selected for analysis. Among them, 5\u00a0% of number-removal code samples were added to monitor their quality during the element analysis. The test data error was\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0% after comparison in these two laboratories. The trace elements tests were completed at the Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Northwest Geology and Mineral Resources Testing Center, Xi'an Northwest geological Institute of Nonferrous Metals Co. ltd., respectively. Testing mainly using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Instrument models Agilent 7700x and X\u22127, respectively) with an analytic precision of\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0%. Qi et al. (2000) and Zhang et al. (2011) described the analytical methods and technological processes. The test results (Sup. Tables 1\u20133\n\n) were valid.\nSince most of the statistical methods conform to the normal distribution assumption. The original geochemical data are normalized by an appropriate method such as log-ratio transformation, which provides suitable conditions for reducing the deviations values of extreme high and low. In order to calculate the geochemical thresholds, the extreme high values of elements (e.g, W\u00a0>\u00a0800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, Sn\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, Mo\u00a0>\u00a0300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, etc.) were eliminated firstly. Then according to the extreme high values are greater than three times the standard deviation for many times. The mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0two standard deviations was used depict the nested hierarchy trace elements anomalies and identify geochemical thresholds. But for the calculated geochemical thresholds of some elements were still very high, the value at one third of the content are taken as the geochemical thresholds. Therefore, based on above principle, cluster analysis (CA) and factor analysis (FA) methods (Tripathi, 1979) for analyzing trace elements in tectonic rocks and multivariate statistical tools were used for data processing by using Statistica 12 for Windows. The elements with a normal distribution and close relation to mineralization were selected in CA. Using the linkage distance (similarity degree) and Pearson R correlation coefficient, an R-type CA dendrogram was obtained and the effective element combinations were divided according to the linkage distance. By grouping the correlated variables to form the CA and FA, thereby achieving significant data reduction and simplifying data interpretation (Tripathi, 1979). Then the anomalies are circled using the factor scores of each sampling point. And combined with the actual geological features to reveal the element correlation and examine the spatial distribution of factor scores to prove the anomalies. Final analysis and summary anomalous features and delineating important prospecting targets. The aims and main procedures of the tectono-geochemistry method are shown in Han et al. (2015).\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nR-type cluster analysis\nCA can directly reflect the interrelationship and associated characteristics of trace elements in ore deposits and fault zones. Higher values (linkage distance) indicate better correlation of trace elements. Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo, Cd, Sn, W, Pb, Bi, Ag, Li, Rb, Cs, LREEs and HREEs were selected as cluster element combinations in the\u00a0\u2212136 and\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m level adits, respectively. However, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Sb, Pb, As, W, Mo, Sn, Bi, Ge, LREEs, HREEs, Rb, Cs, Zr, Nb, Hf, Th, U, Li, Co, V, Cr, Ni and Sr were conducted on the joint profile in the southern area of this deposit. The dendrograms are plotted in Fig. 6\n. R-type cluster analyses were conducted on trace element data of different level adits and the joint profile of this deposit. The results show that the linkage distance coefficient of 0.4 for\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m, 0.4 for\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m and of 0.5 for joint profile in the southern area. The combination of trace elements shows similar characteristics. In\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m, (i) Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag and Sn; (ii) W, Mo and Bi; (iii) \u2211REE, Rb, Li and Cs; and (iv) Co and Ni were subdivided (Fig. 6a). In\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m, (i) Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Sb, Sn, As and Bi; (ii) W and Mo; (iii) \u2211REE, Rb, Li and Co; and (iv) Cs and Ni were subdivided (Fig. 6b). In the joint profile of the southern area, (i) Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Sb, Pb and As; (ii) W, Mo, Sn, Bi and Ge; (iii) LREEs, HREEs, Rb, Cs, Zr, Nb, Hf, Th, U, Li and Co; and (iv) V, Cr, Ni and Sr were subdivided (Fig. 6c).\n\n\n5.2\nR-type factor analysis\nThe R-type FA presents complex factors of different level adits were shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4\n. When the cumulative variance contributions are 75.99\u00a0% for\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m, 72.46\u00a0% for\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m and 77.72\u00a0% for joint profile of the southern area. The results showed that total 5 or 6 complex factors with certain geological significance were extracted from different study objects. For\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m, mainly the FA1 (Ga, Rb, Zr, Cs, Hf, Th, U, LREEs and HREEs), FA2 (Zn, Ag, Cd, Sb and Pb), FA3 (\u2013V, \u2013Cr and \u2013Ni), FA4 (W, Mo, Sn and Bi) and FA5 (Cu) and FA6 (no geological significance) (Table 2). For\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m mainly composed of FA1 (Co, Ga, Rb, Zr, Cs, Cs, Hf, Th, U, LREEs and HREEs), FA2 (\u2013Cu, \u2013Zn, \u2013Sb, \u2013Pb, \u2013Ag and \u2013Cd), FA3 (Ge, W, Mo, Sn and Bi), FA4 (\u2013V and \u2013Cr) and FA5 (no geological significance) (Table 3). In the joint profile of the southern area, FA1 was Sc, Rb, Zr, Nb, Cs, Hf, Th, U, LREEs, HREEs; FA2 was \u2013Cu, \u2013Zn, \u2013Ag, \u2013Cd, \u2013Sb, \u2013Pb; FA3 was Be, Ge, Mo, Sn, W, Bi; FA4 was V, Cr and Ni; FA5 has no geological significance but FA6 was Cu (Table 4). Compared with the above results, it can be roughly classified into 5 elements combinations. The element combinations extracted from FA1 of the above three research objects were the same. It represents the trace element assemblages of the ore-bearing rocks and mainly enriched in feldspar and mica phenocrysts. Because Th and U have a similar geochemical behavior and are closely related to the formation of granitic plutons (Liu et al., 1984). Furthermore, REEs and Zr are enriched in feldsic plutons (Liu et al., 1984). The second type is FA2, consisting of Zn\u2013Ag\u2013Cd\u2013Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Cu, and the results remain consistent for different level adits. FA2 mainly represents the trace element assemblages of hydrothermal vein-type Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Cu mineralization at medium\u2013low temperatures. Sphalerite, galena, pyrite and pyrrhotite as the main mineral components, accompanied by granular arsenopyrite, emulsion-dropped stibnite, silver and other metallic minerals. The third type is Be\u2013Ge\u2013Mo\u2013Sn\u2013W\u2013Bi. It represents the high-temperature ore elements tend to be enriched in calc-silicate rocks. FA4 for\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m, FA3 for\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m and joint profiles are all such results. Scheelite, molybdenite, cassiterite, magnetite, etc. are the main metal minerals. The fourth type is V, Cr and Ni. These element combinations occurred in ultrabasic\u00a0\u2212\u00a0basic rocks (Shao, 1997). However, these rocks were undeveloped in this deposit. Pyrite and pyrrhotite widely distributed in the mining area generally contain high concentrations of V, Cr and Ni (Zhu et al., 2022). The last type is Cu and only in joint profile can be extracted. Therefore, it directly indicates Cu mineralization.\n\n\n5.3\nDelineation of geochemical anomalies\nCombined with the results of FA and CA, and also the geological characteristics of the deposit. We use Mapgis 6.7 to generate tectonic geochemical anomaly-geological map of different levels (Figs. 7\u20139\n\n\n). Whether in plan or in the southern joint profile, the contour anomaly-geochemical maps show the similar features, only the difference in the number of anomalous zone. Firstly, zones circled by FA1 were generally consistent with quartz porphyry and granite porphyry and with the NNE\u2013SSW trending. The 2 zones (A, B) for\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m (Fig. 7a), 5 zones (A, B, C, D, E) for\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m (Fig. 8a) and 2 zones for southern joint profile (Fig. 9a) were delineated. Delineated zones represented by FA2 are distributed near the concave\u2013convex parts of porphyry, with a ring-like structure. Usually these zones where the dense massive galena\u2013sphalerite\u2013pyrite\u2013pyrrhotite orebodies occurs. Details of 3 in\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m, 6 in\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m and 3 in southern joint profile were shown in Fig. 7b, 8b, 9b. The anomaly maps of Be\u2013Ge\u2013Mo\u2013Sn\u2013W\u2013Bi and Zn\u2013Ag\u2013Cd\u2013Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Cu are distributed in different areas in different levels. Some high-value anomaly zones overlap with FA1. Its occurrence corresponds to the concave\u2013convex area of porphyry (Fig. 7c, 8c, 9c). From the deposit\u2019s geological characteristics, these anomalies were closely related to the alteration zones of II and III. It is apparent that anomaly maps of V\u2013Cr\u2013Ni and Zn\u2013Ag\u2013Cd\u2013Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Cu are generally overlapped although the area of former anomaly is far larger than the later (Fig. 7d, 8d, 9d). As shown in Fig. 8e, Cu anomalies are only distributed in the concave parts of the contact zone between quartz porphyry and limestone, delineated three anomalous zones dipping east.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSpatial variation of tectono-geochemical anomalies\nThe solution to the unclear positioning of deep concealed orebodies in Huangshaping is to identify the spatial variation characteristics in different levels of the deposit. Combined with the results of CA, FA and geological characteristics of the deposit. As shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9, the spatial distributions of high values of FAs are highly consistent with identified orebodies. It can provide a geochemical basis for deep-prospecting prediction.\nBased on the linkage distances and geological characteristics of different level adits in this deposit. CA results show that two types of ore-forming element combinations were extracted, including (i) skarn-type dominated by W, Sn, Mo, and Bi and (ii) hydrothermal vein-type mostly comprising Cu, Pb, Zn, Co, Ni, Cd, Sb, As and Ag (Fig. 6). The linkage distances are above 0.5, indicating a positive correlation. Macroscopically, magnetite, molybdenite, scheelite, cassiterite and other ore minerals were developed in (i); however, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, bismuthinite, and other ore minerals were developed in (ii). In addition, from shallow to deep, the anomalies of Zn\u2013Ag\u2013Cd\u2013Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Cu gradually decrease with the increase of depth. The factor scores of the shallow levels are higher than that of the deep levels. But W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi anomalous zones are the opposite. In the deep part of the mining area, high-temperature medium-acid granitic magma leads to strong fluid\u2013rock interaction. W-sn-Mo-Bi orebodies are easily formed while Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013(Ag) orebodies are poorly formed. During the prograde metamorphic stage, the magmatic emplacement in the deep part of Huangshaping deposit. The temperature of the fluid decreased to 528\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C and the depth was 2.2\u20133\u00a0km, the occurrence of fluid immiscibility (Huang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016). A weak fluid\u2013rock interaction lead to the coexistence of W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi orebodies and Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013(Ag) orebodies.\nAccording to the different geochemical anomaly contour maps plotted by different FAs. It is obvious that the anomalous zones in the\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m level significantly increased compared with the\u00a0\u2212136\u00a0m (Figs. 7 and 8). Usually, these abnormal high-value zones overlap in the plane or profile. They also show similar variation characteristics to the aforementioned alteration zoning patterns (see Section 3.4 for details). But the high-value and low-value zones of anomalies derived from different FAs are opposite, mainly due to the main ore-controlling factors (e.g., rock types or structures), ore-forming temperature and the distance from porphyry. The results showed FA2 and FA3 have a negative correlation, i.e., high-temperature element assemblages developed where medium\u2013low-temperature element assemblages did not (Figs. 7 and 8). This phenomenon is also verified by the study of fluid inclusions that the ore-forming temperatures are\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C for W\u2013Sn ore and 200\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C for Pb\u2013Zn ore, respectively (Li et al., 2016). The W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi and Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013(Ag) ore formations are related to quartz porphyry and granite porphyry respectively. Field geological characteristics show that the former is near to the porphyry and the latter is far away. Meanwhile, we can also clearly find that these two high-value anomalous zones are not chaotic. Conversely, they follow certain rules. They are usually distributed in the concave to convex parts of porphyry (Figs. 7, 8 and 9). Such characteristics are obvious on the joint profile. The contact zone and faults are favorable position for skarn-type and hydrothermal vein-type orebodies formation respectively, indicating a good metallogenic potential in the deep part. The high value zone of Cu is located in the host rock adjacent to the west side of quartz porphyry. However, the anomalies were undeveloped in the granite porphyry side. Therefore, quartz porphyry directly controls Cu mineralization. Connecting lines of high-value anomalous zones in the joint profile were NNE\u2013SSW trending and SE dipping (Fig. 9), which indicates that the polymetallic orebodies generally dip to SE. This is consistent with the field facts of years of geological exploration (Fig. 3b and 3c).\n\n\n6.2\nDepth evaluation index of tectono-geochemical anomalies\nCombined with the geological characteristics of this deposit, anomaly index of the trace element combinations in the deposit are as follows:\n\n(1)\nComprehensive index of trace element anomalies: The vertical hydrothermal alteration intensity and scale are weak in the shallow but strong in the deep. Comprehensive study of spatial variation of tectono-geochemical anomalies. It is inferred that the concealed granite porphyry, skarn, and mineralization zones might continue to extend in depth, indicating favorable prospecting for skarn-type orebodies. The contour anomaly geological map of the FAs results showed that the spatial variation characteristics of the different levels (Figs. 7 and 8) and vertical (Fig. 9), the length, width and height of the high value anomaly have the equal distance. Without considering the ground pressure and geothermal gradients, on the plane, FA1, FA2 and FA3 element combinations anomaly length between 350 and 400\u00a0m, width between 120 and 400\u00a0m (Figs. 7 and 8). The exploration results proved that the vertical quartz porphyry and granite porphyry swelling\u2013shrinking wavelengths are 100\u2013140\u00a0m (Fig. 10\n). Vertically, the swelling\u2013shrinking wavelength variation of W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi and Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013(Ag) ore-forming elements anomaly are consistent with the occurrence of porphyry (Figs. 7\u20139 and 10), confirming that the positions of geometric variation of porphyry are the main enrichment sites of ore-forming elements. According to the vertical variation of tectonic geochemical anomaly element combinations, multiple peak positions occur in the deep part. Thus, it is speculated that The\u00a0\u2212346 to\u00a0\u2212406\u00a0m and\u00a0\u2212\u00a0436 to\u00a0\u2212526\u00a0m rock mass gradually expands (Fig. 10). In addition, Gong et al. (2015) reported that the content of main ore-forming elements increased - decreased - increased with the increase of depth in the the\u00a0\u2212246.8 to\u00a0\u2212337.55\u00a0m section of borehole KZ12101. This follows the same pattern of wall-rock alteration in the deposit. It can be inferred that in the deep part, the scale of altered porphyry and the wall-rock alteration gradually increase, the content of ore-forming elements will also increase. Therefore, tectonic geochemistry anomaly information can be used as an index to indicate the extension of magmatic intrusive tectonic system to the deep;\n\n\n(2)\nThe pitch of the orebodies: From shallow to deep, the anomaly gradient of FA1 gradually weakened from the middle to the outside of the mining area, indicating that the Pb\u2013Zn mineralization anomaly is weakened in the NWW\u2013SEE direction (Figs. 7\u20139). FAs results also show that the general anomaly trend is NNE\u2013SSW or NE\u2013SW trending. And anomaly contour gradually decreases on the NW and SE sides but were unclosed, indicating that the pitching direction of the orebodies are SSE\u2013NNW and SE-NW.\n\n\n(3)\nOre-forming fluid migration: The anomaly contour-spreading patterns of different FAs can reveal the ore-forming fluid migration direction. However, in general, the W-Sn-Mo-Bi anomalies are distributed in the SE area and Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013(Ag) anomalies are distributed in the NW and N areas, which are consistent with the occurrence of the identified orebodies in this deposit. Faults and porphyry morphology mostly controlled the occurrence of the W\u2013Sn\u2013Mo\u2013Bi orebodies in the SE area. The corresponding relationship between the spatial distribution of element anomalies and different orebodies shows that the ore-forming fluid migration direction has a vertically bottom\u2013top migration along the main fault (F1\u2013F3 faults), with SE\u2013NW characteristics in the levels. Horizontal- and vertical-mineralized alteration zones are characterized by the transition from altered porphyry to skarn and hydrothermal alteration zones. The skarn on the NW area was significantly weaker than that on the SE area, and the anomaly contour of the SE area is open. This understanding is consistent with that of a previous study by Zhu et al. (2012), who used S isotopes to demonstrate that the overall trend of isotope zoning is NNW\u2013SSE and SSE unclosed at the 20\u00a0m level. Zhu et al. (2012) recognized that mineralization\u2013alteration zoning and metallogenic temperature-decreasing gradients also correspond to each other. The comprehensive anomaly distribution pattern in the levels and profiles indicates that the center of the tectono-geochemical anomaly gradient migrates from the NW to the SE. Thus, the flowing direction of deep ore-forming fluid is from the SE to the NW. Combined with geological characteristics, another mineralization center with favorable metallogenic condition and great resource potential could exist in the deep SE area in this deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\nDeep-spreading pattern of ore-controlling structures and prospecting direction\nBy synthesizing the exploration results of the level adits of the shallow mining area. The comprehensive index of tectono-geochemical anomalies indicating deep polymetallic mineralization is integrated to construct the deep-prospecting pattern (Fig. 10).\nShallow exploration results show that the wavelength variation period of the shape and occurrence of ore-forming porphyry is 100\u2013140\u00a0m (i.e., \u03bb \u2248 100\u2013140\u00a0m and 1\/2\u03bb \u2248 50\u201370\u00a0m) (Gong et al., 2015). The pattern of expansion, pinch-out and reappearance along the dip direation of the main ore-forming porphyry. It is the main reason why orebodies and alteration zones have similar periodic variation patterns. From the concave to convex parts of the ore-forming porphyry are favorable structural position for polymetallic mineralization. Comprehensive study level and profile trace element combination anomalies, the connection line of high value anomalous zones corresponds to the aforementioned characteristics of porphyry swelling and shrinking (Fig. 9), showing periodic wave-like changes (Fig. 10). The main orebodies are distributed in the parts from swelling to shrinking (Figs. 5 and 9). The wave-like mineralization anomaly patterns can effectively indicate the length\u2013width\u2013height features of the orebodies in space (Figs. 7\u20139). Thus, we predict that the porphyry, orebodies in the unproven area below\u00a0\u2212400\u00a0m exhibit periodic fluctuation patterns (Fig. 10). The height difference of the main orebodies is 25\u201335\u00a0m in the deep part of the deposit (i.e., 1\/4\u03bb \u2248 25\u201335\u00a0m) (Figs. 9 and 10). The length of the main orebodies ranges from 130 to 150\u00a0m (1\/2\u03bb \u2248 130\u2013150\u00a0m) (Figs. 7, 8 and 10). From the exposed width of the orebodies on the plane, the width of the hydrothermal vein-type and skarn-type orebodies are between 60 and 70\u00a0m (Figs. 8 and 10).\nTo verify the feasibility of the above model (Fig. 10), The W\u2013Mo mineralization element contents of ZK506, ZK517, and ZK508 in the No. 113 cross section in the deposit (Tao, 2020). The results show that the WO3 and Mo contents in the mineralized skarn near\u00a0\u2212256 and\u00a0\u2212336\u00a0m are high. At the same time, the average element contents at\u00a0\u2212336\u00a0m in each borehole are significantly higher than that of\u00a0\u2212256\u00a0m (Table 5\n). The wave-like patterns at depths inferred from tectono-geochemical anomalies generally correlate with the exposure height of the orebodies. In summary, the proposed tectonic geochemical anomaly deep-prospecting model for the Huangshaping deposit (Fig. 10) is effective and can provide a theoretical basis for predicting deep rocks and polymetallic orebodies.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nThe comprehensive research of tectono-geochemical anomalies helps to establish a bridge connecting shallow to deep anomalies of the Huangshaping deposit, which can provide geochemical information of orebodies, ore-forming porphyry and ore-controlling structures extending to the deep. Then, this artical determines the effective indicator for deep comprehensive prospecting anomaly elements combination (i.e., W, Sn, Mo, Bi and Cu, Pb, Zn, Co, Ni, Cd, Sb, As, Ag). The periodic variation of the anomaly centers in plane and profile indicates to a certain degree that different types of orebodies are accompanied by deep-spresding pattern of ore-forming porphyry bodies. The concealed orebodies may be trending to the NNE\u2013SSW or NE\u2013SW, dip to SSE or SE. It is speculated that the length, height difference and width of the main orebodies indicated by tectono-geochemical anomalies are 60\u201370\u00a0m, 25\u201335\u00a0m and 130\u2013150\u00a0m, respectively. In addition, the anomalous spatial variation indicates that the ore-forming fluid migrates from SE to NW to the shallow; the SE district of the mining area has good prospecting potential for skarn-type orebodies. This study is of great significant for geochemical exploration of different types of deep-seated polymetallic orebodies in the Huangshaping deposit, and even the entire southern Hunan area.\n\n","4":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nStudies over the Volcanic-Hosted, or -Associated, or Volcano-Sedimentary-Hosted Massive Sulfide deposits (VMS, following the nomenclature of Barrie and Hannington, 1999) are immense (see Shanks et al., 2012; Triantafyllidis et al., 2021 and references therein). However, there are very limited attempts to correlate the theoretical predictions and numerical modeling to the mechanisms of deposition and alteration zoning during the evolution of a VMS hydrothermal system, with predictive exploration targeting. We highlight on this subject the published work of Parmentier and Spooner (1978); Cathles (1981, 1983, 1993); Barrie et al. (1999); Jupp and Schultz (2000); Schardt et al. (2001); Schardt et al. (2005), Schardt et al. (2006); Yang (2002); Schardt and Large (2009); Salama et al. (2018); Pierre et al. (2018) and Fuchs et al. (2019). These authors have used as case studies areas with world-class fossilized VMS deposits (e.g., Draa-Sfar in Morocco, Hellyer and Panorama Pilbara in Australia, Kidd Creek in Canada), or their modern analogues, i.e., mid-ocean ridge black smokers (e.g., Skouriotissa and Mavrovouni, Cyprus, Hokuroku, Japan, trans-Atlantic Geo-Traverse, Juan de Fuca Ridge, Valu Fa Ridge Lau Basin) to model and reconstruct their evolution. Based on the above studies, ore deposition and alteration are controlled by temperature (\u223c200\u00b0 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C), pressure (\u2264500 bars), fluid chemistry (e.g., pH, activity ratios, bulk concentration of\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100\u00a0ppm of dissolved metals and redox state), at variable fluid\/rock ratios, from ore-forming fluids that vent and discharge at the seafloor. The VMS deposits are formed over normal fault-controlled ridge flanks from hydrothermal convection cells and plumes with lifespan between\u00a0\u223c\u00a02.5 Ka and\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma. The ore-forming fluids are predicted to be mixtures of magmatic fluids and seawater which evolve due to water\u2013rock interaction, cooling and phase separation. The generalized anticipated alteration zoning is composed of centric silica, passing outward to chlorite- and then to sericite-dominated zones.\n\nSchardt and Large (2009) reported that, even though these models are roughly unsophisticated and with many limitations, they have significantly aided to the reconstruction of a generally accepted architecture for the VMS deposits. Moreover, there is a small probability to reconstruct an entire metamorphosed\/deformed, ancient VMS hydrothermal system (as they mostly appear from Precambrian to Mesozoic) from its heat source to the up- and down-flow zones and into the VMS orebody (Schardt et al. 2005, Schardt and Large, 2009). The objective of this study, following up the one recently published by Triantafyllidis et al. (2021) using their results regarding the age, type, conditions of formation and geotectonic setting, is to reconstruct and model the\u00a0\u223c\u00a066 to 65\u00a0Ma, atypical, Ermioni \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d VMS which comprises almost exclusively monomineralic and barren pyrite (\u226595\u00a0vol%). We have focused on the Karakasi mine due to its almost ideal VMS architecture, i.e., the near-surface exposure of stringer and massive ore and its limited dismemberment (Fig. 1\n). We aim to decipher, from a hydraulic and geochemical point of view, the distribution and evolution of alteration patterns identified at the footwall and hangingwall of the Ermioni VMS hydrothermal system. We have additionally combined data from fluid inclusions, fluid chemistry and physicochemical characterization techniques, i.e., SEM-EDS, Raman, XRD and Specific Surface Area (SSA) analyses, with thermodynamic estimations and hydraulic, as well as geochemical simulations to have a better understanding of fluid circulation flow and mechanism of ore precipitation that could contribute to future exploration targeting.\n\n\n2\nRegional and deposit geology\nThe geology of Argolis peninsula comprises a Paleozoic basement which is overlain by five tectonic nappes with ages from Permian to Paleocene-Eocene (following Robertson et al., 1991; Clift and Dixon, 1998; Bortolotti et al., 2002, 2003; Saccani et al., 2002, 2003; see also the review of geology by Triantafyllidis et al., 2021, Fig. 1a): i) The lowermost \u201cTrapezona Unit\u201d is composed of middle Triassic-to-upper Jurassic neritic carbonates, followed by deep-water limestones and ophiolite olistostromes, ii) The \u201cDhimaina Ophiolitic Unit\u201d comprises MORBs covered by Cretaceous limestones and Paleocene-Eocene flysch, iii) The \u201cAdheres Melang\u00e9 Unit\u201d hosts the Ermioni VMS and comprises late Cretaceous to Paleocene turbidites, iv) The \u201cIliokastron Melang\u00e9 Unit\u201d consists of an ophiolite melang\u00e9 and, v) The uppermost \u201cFaniskos Unit\u201d comprises upper Cretaceous neritic carbonates. At Ermioni mining area, the late Cretaceous to Paleocene \u201cAdheres Melang\u00e9 Unit\u201d volcanosedimentary turbidite succession (\u223c8 km thick) lies over the \u201cTrapezona\u201d and \u201cDhimaina Ophiolitic\u201d units (Bortolotti et al., 2003). It comprises Maastrichtian shales interbedded with sandstones, limestones, and basalts-to-andesites, topped by alternating silts, sandstones, marls, shales, and conglomerates (Fig. 1b and c, Baumgartner, 1985; Bortolotti et al., 2002).\nThe Ermioni VMS is a \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d massive sulfide ore formed due to hydrothermal circulation in a depression of the \u201cAdheres Melang\u00e9 Unit\u201d during late Cretaceous (details in Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). The massive sulfide ores at Karakasi and Roro mines occur as seven major massive lenses, or irregularly shaped and layered orebodies, with maximum length of\u00a0\u223c\u00a075\u00a0m and width of\u00a0\u223c\u00a07\u00a0m (Fig. 1d, e). At Karakasi the stringer ore fills in a N-to-NNE- (quartz veins) and W-trending (calcite veins) conjugate system. Two paragenetic stages of hypogene mineralization are recognized. Stage I comprises pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrrhotite, magnetite and chalcopyrite, whereas stage II includes pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and rare galena, freibergite, chalcocite and marcasite (Tombros et al., 2007; Triantafyllidis et al., 2021).\nThe footwall of the Ermioni VMS deposit is composed of mafic-intermediate volcaniclastic rocks overlain by arkoses, while the hangingwall comprises alternations of shales, sandstones, rare exhalites and iron formations (Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). Alteration zoning with depth includes a silica-grunerite alteration zone, at the base, surrounded by widespread chloritization, while its top is marked by an albite-prehnite zone. Passing outward from the stringer ore, alteration is developed as three successive zones, i.e., an inner silica zone, followed by an intermediate silica-chlorite zone, and then by an outer silica-epidote (\u00b1albite-chlorite) zone (Triantafyllidis et al., 2021) (Fig. 1b, c and 5a).\n\n\n3\nAnalytical techniques and modeling procedure\nWe have applied an approach using analytical techniques and modeling that included: i) Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy, fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry and Laser Raman spectroscopy analyses (on quartz, pyrite and chalcopyrite crystals contained in samples collected from the Karakasi stringer and massive ore by Triantafyllidis et al., 2021, c.f., ESM 1, Table 1a) to estimate the ore-forming fluid parameters, mechanisms of precipitation and chemistry, and ii) Geochemical and hydraulic numerical simulations. Geochemical modeling relied on XRD and SEM-EDS analyses and the spreadsheet MINSQ (Herrmann and Berry, 2002) to calculate the Karakasi alteration norms, as well as chemical equilibria via Solveq and Chiller software (Reed, 1998; Spycher and Read, 1990a; Spycher and Read, 1990b; Schardt et al., 2001; Schardt and Large, 2009). The composition of the VMS multicomponent ore fluid was assembled relying on Solveq, using the obtained fluid inclusions and Raman data (Table\u00a01\n). The ore fluid modification, evolution and mechanisms of precipitation were tested with Chiller (Table 1). Chemical conditions were assessed from phase stability relationships of sulfides, silicates, and carbonates with NaCl-saturated aqueous fluids, using SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992). Hydraulic modeling was based on the Hydrotherm Interactive 3.2.0 software (Kipp et al., 2008, released by the US Geological Survey, 2016). For the hydraulic model parameters, setup and development, the specific surface area (SSA), pore volume (VP), pore shape and size distribution and porosity of the massive and stringer ores were determined using the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller technique (BET) (Table 1). We have also used data reported by Triantafyllidis et al. (2021) (e.g., SEM-EDS and whole-rock analyses, c.f., ESM 1, Tables\u00a02a, b, c and d, 3a, b; oxygen and sulfur isotopes, c.f., Tables 1 and 2). Fluid inclusions in\u00a0\u2264\u00a0200\u00a0mm-thick doubly-polished wafers of stringer quartz and pyrite were studied using standard techniques (e.g., samples EK12, 13, 14, 16 and 22, Table 2\n). Temperatures were determined independently based on the Raman analyses of the gaseous and liquid phase of fluid inclusions employing the H2S- and CO2\/H2S- (Nehring and D\u2019Amore, 1984; Arn\u00f3rsson and Gunnlaugsson, 1995) and the Na-K-, Na-K-Ca- and K-Mg-geothermometers (Fournier, 1979; Fournier and Truesdell, 1973; Fournier and Potter, 1982; Giggenbach et al., 1998), and the pyrite-chalcopyrite and pyrite-sphalerite isotopic pairs (ESM Fig. 2d). Contour analysis, using Surfer 9.9 and the Eu and Ce anomalies, as well as the geochemical ratios Ba\/K and Mn\/Mg, was used to plot the spatial distribution on contour maps based on sampling data sets for each of the above element ratios for the Karakasi VMS. Additional details of the analytical methodology, limitations, and thermodynamic modeling of the physicochemical parameters are reported in the ESM.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nQuartz cathodoluminescence\nCathodoluminescence analysis was performed on quartz crystals from Karakasi stringer ore (ESM Fig. 2). Two fluid pulses are recorded for the stringer ore at Karakasi mine (ESM Fig. 2e). The first pulse involves coarse-grained quartz related to the inner silica zone, luminescing in homogeneous rusty-reddish and intergrowing with euhedral, coarse-grained pyrite. The second one involves fine-grained polycrystalline aggregates, or veinlets of greenish-luminescent quartz and pyrite filling open spaces due to hydrothermal circulation.\n\n\n4.2\nFluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy\nFluid inclusion data were obtained from quartz crystals of the Karakasi stringer ore including both generations based on cathodoluminescence examination (e.g., samples EK12, 14 and 22 from coarse-grained quartz, and samples EK13 and 16 from fine-grained quartz, Table 2). Low-populated Fluid Inclusion Assemblages (henceforth FIAs) of almost monotonous, small-sized (with diameters between 5 and 30\u00a0\u03bcm), mainly negative-formed, irregular, rounded-to-elongated and rough-walled inclusions that occur isolated, or in clusters were considered primary (following the nomenclature of Bodnar, 2003). Only these inclusions (hosted in quartz crystals with no evidence of undulose extinction and in equilibrium with pyrite, ESM Fig. 2f) were selected for microthermometrical analysis. FIAs that occur alongside healed fractures as clusters and linear arrays intercepting the crystal boundaries were considered secondary. Many primary inclusions show evidence of decrepitation, necking and some leakage, due to anchimetamorphism (Triantafyllidis et al. 2021). Necking is manifested in fluid inclusions that show a diversity of vapor-to-liquid ratios. Examples of representative FIAs are shown in Fig. 2\na, b, c and d.\nAt room temperature, four types of fluid inclusions were identified (Fig. 2a, b, c, d, Table 2):\n\ni)\n\nType I: Aqueous liquid inclusions (L-V) that contain \u2264 \u223c 80\u00a0vol% liquid, representing the predominant fluid inclusion type of the Ermioni VMS,\n\n\nii)\n\nType II: Rare two-liquid aqueous inclusions (L1-L2-V) that contain \u2264 \u223c 60\u00a0vol% liquid, i.e., H2O, fluorescent CH4 and\/or CO2 (Fig. 2c, d). Formation of clathrate in these inclusions was observed during freezing (identified by movement of the vapor bubble jerked twice),\n\n\niii)\n\nType III: Solid-bearing polyphase inclusions (S1-S2-S3-S4-S5-S6-L-V, in which the vapor bubble occupies\u00a0\u2264\u00a030\u00a0vol%). These inclusions contain as daughter minerals quartz, albite, pyrite\/marcasite, Fe-oxide\/-chloride, and rare sulfohalite [Na6(F,Cl)(SO4)2] and burkeite [Na6(CO3)(SO4)2], in addition to halite (based on their optical properties and Raman analyses, ESM Fig. 7),\n\n\niv)\n\nType IV: Rare vapor-rich aqueous inclusions (V-L) that contain between\u00a0\u223c\u00a060 and 80\u00a0vol% vapor in most of the inclusions.\n\n\n\nLaser Raman spectroscopic analyses were conducted on type I fluid inclusions hosted in quartz from Karakasi stringer ore. The gaseous phase contains mostly N2, CH4, CO2 and H2S, and traces of O2, H2 and C2H6 (in mol fractions %, Tables 2, 3\n, Fig. 2g). The temperatures of initial ice (Tf) and clathrate (Tf-clathrate) melting of all types were \u221235\u00b0\u00b12.5\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of MgCl2 in addition to NaCl in the ore fluid. The ice-melting temperatures of carbonic phase (TmCO2) were \u221262.7\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C confirming the presence of CH4, in addition to CO2 in the ore solution.\nThe temperatures of last ice melting (Tm-ice) for the clathrate-free, type I, IV and III inclusions range from \u22127.4\u00b0 to \u22122.3\u00a0\u00b0C. Using the packages Fluids 1 and AQSO3e (Bakker, 2003) for the system H2O-NaCl-MgCl2, the combined values correspond to salinities of 2.1 to 10.4\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent (M\u00a0=\u00a06.5 and SD\u00a0=\u00a02.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent, Table 2 and Fig. 2e). The melting temperatures of clathrate (Tm-cl) in type II inclusions were 6.7\u00b0\u00b10.2\u00a0\u00b0C that correspond to salinities of 4.2 to 4.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent (Table 2, Darling, 1991). Solubility calculations based on Raman data of the liquid phase indicate that Cl- (\u223c10\u00a0ppm) is the predominant anion in the early ore-forming solution (stage I), with F-, CO3\n2\u2013, HS- and SO4\n-2 being also present, yet at trace levels. The predominant cations in the mineralizing solution were Si4+ (\u2264 \u223c 1710\u00a0ppm) and Mg+2 (\u2264 \u223c 140\u00a0ppm), though minor Fe+2, Na+, K+ and Ca2+ and traces of Sr2+, Al3+ and Ti2+ were detected (Table 3).\nType I, III and IV fluid inclusions homogenize to liquid upon heating between 344\u00b0 and 407\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas type II inclusions (containing CO2 and CH4) homogenize to liquid or vapor between 332\u00b0 and 386\u00a0\u00b0C (M\u00a0=\u00a0375\u00b0, SD\u00a0=\u00a025\u00b0 and M0\u00a0=\u00a0354\u00a0\u00b0C, Table 2 and Fig. 2e). The CO2 homogenizes to liquid or vapor at 30.2\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C. Fluid densities were 0.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 and 0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0g\/cm3 for type II and I inclusions respectively, and trapping pressures range from 102 to 173 bars (M\u00a0=\u00a0158 and SD\u00a0=\u00a016 bars, Table 2, Fig. 2e). A pressure correction of\u00a0+\u00a035\u00a0\u00b0C was applied to the homogenization temperatures to obtain the trapping temperatures (based on the independent geothermometers presented at Table 3 and the \u201cHokie Flincs_H2O-NaCl\u201d spreadsheet, Steele-MacInnis et al., 2012).\n\n\n4.3\nGeochemical modeling of alteration mineral abundances and elemental mobility\nPrior modeling, the degree of alteration of both footwall and hangingwall lithologies was examined (data from Triantafyllidis et al. 2021, c.f. ESM Tables\u00a01b, 3a, 3b). The footwall volcaniclastic rocks show relatively low degree of alteration, with Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) values \u2264 \u223c70\u00a0%, and plot in the \u201cleast altered\u201d field of the Ishikawa Alteration Index (AI) (Ishikawa et al., 1976) versus the Chlorite-Carbonate-Pyrite Index (CCPI) (ESM Fig. 9a, b). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the primary hydrothermal alteration features of the footwall volcaniclastic rocks are largely preserved. The hangingwall turbidites show higher degree of alteration relative to the footwall lithotypes, with CIA values ranging between\u00a0\u223c\u00a069 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a078\u00a0% (ESM Fig. 9a), trending towards the \u201cIllite\u201d and \u201cSericite\u201d fields in both the CIA ternary and AI versus CCPI binary diagrams (ESM Fig. 9a, b).\nThe spreadsheet MINSQ (Herrmann and Berry, 2002) was used to estimate the changes in mineral compositions of the silica, silica-chlorite and silica-sericite alteration zones based on their litho-petrography and -chemistry. MINSQ relies on the least squares method to estimate the alteration norms (in vol. %) within each of the above alteration zones. We have used the microanalyses of chlorite, grunerite, albite and prehnite and combined these with whole-rock analyses (c.f., ESM 1, Tables\u00a02a, b, c and d, 3a, b, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). This method yields multiple solutions with varying degrees of accuracy. The results with the minimum residuals were chosen as representative for the Ermioni VMS (ESM Table 3, Fig. 2g). The Isocon method of Grant (2005) was applied to assess the mobility of metals in the Ermioni VMS alteration zones (ESM Table 3 and Fig. 8a, b). For our calculations we have employed the representative major element analyses of the volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks (c.f., ESM 1, Table\u00a03a, b, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). Metal mobility is established by the deviation of major and trace elements from the line of constant mass represented by the Al2O3 isocon (as Al2O3 is considered immobile, ESM Fig. 8a).\n\n\n4.4\nPhysicochemical conditions of Ermioni VMS\nOur thermodynamic modeling was set between 200\u00b0 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C based on data from fluid inclusions microthermometry and Triantafyllidis et al. (2021) (c.f. ESM 1, Table\u00a02a, i.e., the chlorite-geothermometer of Zang and Fyre, 1995). Deposition of stringer ore quartz occurred at log\u03b1SiO2(aq) values of \u22120.9 and \u22121.9, indicating saturation of silica in the Karakasi ore-forming fluid. The log(\u03b1K\n+\/\u03b1H\n+), log(\u03b1Na\n+\/\u03b1H\n+), log[\u03b1Ca\n2+\/(\u03b1H\n+)2], log[\u03b1Mg\n2+\/(\u03b1H\n+)2], pH, logfO2(g) and logfH2(g) values were calculated from the albite-sericite, -chlorite, -epidote, -prehnite and sericite-chlorite (\u00b1quartz) and pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrrhotite-magnetite equilibria (at T\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00b0, 300\u00b0, 250\u00b0 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C, Fig. 3\na, b, based on fluid inclusions microthermometry, the H2S- and CO2\/H2S, Na-K-, Na-K-Ca- and K-Mg-geothermometers and the gaseous and liquid phase composition of fluid inclusions, Table 3, ESM Table 2, reactions 2 to 13, using the methodology of McCartney and Lanyon, 1989). For stages I and II (T\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00b0 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C), the logfO2 and logfS2 values are between HM-2.7 and HM-3.9 and PP\u00a0+\u00a01.7 and PP-2.5 (Fig. 3c, d, HM\u00a0=\u00a0Hematite-Magnetite and PP\u00a0=\u00a0Pyrite-Pyrrhotite buffers). The pH values range from 3.6 to 5.0, and so the log\u03b1H2S(aq), log\u03b1HS\n-\n(aq) and log\u03b1H2S(aq), range from \u22122.8 to \u22124.2, \u22120.8 to \u22123.6, and \u22123.3 to \u22121.7, respectively (ESM Table 1).\n\n\n4.5\nThermodynamic and hydraulic modeling\nThe starting parameters and initial composition of the ore forming VMS fluid are given in Table 1. For our model we have set the initial temperature at 350\u00a0\u00b0C (see Cathles, 1993), pH at 3.6 and salinity at 6.5\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent (in accordance with Schardt et al., 2001; Schardt and Large, 2009 which used a salinity at 5.0\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent) and mass of titrated rock of 0.5 and 20\u00a0g which correspond to maximum and minimum water-to-rock ratios of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800 (T\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0\u00b0C) and\u00a0\u223c\u00a020 (T\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b0C). The ore fluid was saturated in quartz, enriched in FeCl+ and CuCl0 complexes (Fig. 3f, Table 3), and equilibrated with pyrite and chalcopyrite based on the ubiquitous occurrence of pyrite and traces of chalcopyrite in both the massive and stringer ores. The log\u03b1Al3+ values, due to low aluminum solubility, were set to zero. We have used the log(\u03b1\nNa\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+), log(\u03b1\nK\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+), log[\u03b1\nCa\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2] and log[\u03b1\nMg\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2] ratios and pH to calculate the log\u03b1\nNa\n+\n(aq), log\u03b1\nK\n+\n(aq), log\u03b1\nCa\n2+\n(aq) and log\u03b1\nMg\n2+\n(aq) values, at the initial temperature of 350\u00a0\u00b0C and pH of 3.6. The log\u03b1Pb2+\n(aq) and log\u03b1Zn2+\n(aq) values were assumed to be\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-3.0 and are adjusted to\u00a0\u223c\u00a020\u00a0% of saturation for minor deposition of sphalerite and galena (ESM Table 1).\nThe hydraulic modeling results from the Ermioni VMS ore-forming setting are presented in Fig. 4\n, illustrating the temporal (from 65.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 down to 64.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021, with a time step of 0.1\u00a0Ma), and spatial evolution of temperature versus fluid flow (initial conditions are illustrated in Fig. 4a). Using the calculated \u03b418O\u03972\u039f isotopic compositions (obtained from quartz, albite, and calcite crystals from the volcaniclastic rocks and stringer ore from Karakasi VMS, c.f., Table 1, Triantafyllidis et al. 2021) and the model proposed by Shanks and Pat (2014) the Ermioni \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d VMS hydrothermal ore fluid was composed of 30 to 35\u00a0vol% seawater (Fig. 4d).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nReconstruction of the Karakasi \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d VMS\n\n5.1.1\nHydraulic modeling\nOur hydraulic model shows that during the early stage of development of the Karakasi hydrothermal system (0.1\u00a0Ma later, i.e., at 65.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma) two smaller plumes, representing the isotherms ranging from 250\u00b0 towards 50\u00a0\u00b0C and a larger one, indicating the 300\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm, are developed over the footwall-hangingwall boundary and within the hangingwall turbidites (Fig. 4b). At the footwall volcaniclastic rocks and arkoses another plume is established, signifying the 350\u00b0 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms, in which the ore-forming fluids flow mainly inwards. The same flow patterns are observed at the footwall-hangingwall boundary and within the hangingwall turbidites. After 0.1\u00a0Ma, i.e., at 64.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma, the initially formed plumes merge to form a single larger plume, representing the 300\u00b0 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms (e.g., temperatures of formation, for stage I, from fluid inclusions are\u00a0\u223c\u00a0335\u00a0\u00b0C) just over the massive ore. The plume is asymmetric, long-lived and creates a downwelling flow area in the hangingwall turbidites. Then the plume in the seawater column expands, whilst the temperature in the upper part of the plume drops rapidly forming a reversed loop (Fig. 4b). At the loop, the temperatures due to mixing with seawater are predicted to be represented by the 200\u00b0 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms (Fig. 4c, related to stage II mineralization). The ore-forming fluids convection currents that contain a proportion of seawater are brought downwards at the right side and move upwards on the left side, or vice-versa.\n\n\n5.1.2\nGeochemical modeling and numerical simulation\nThe silica zone of the \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d Ermioni VMS is anticipated to comprise quartz (\u223c75 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a090\u00a0vol%), although minor chlorite and pyrite may also precipitate (\u2264 \u223c15\u00a0vol% each). Quartz in the exhalite and stringer ore reaches up to\u00a0\u223c\u00a090\u00a0vol%. Quartz accounts up to 35\u00a0vol% of the silica-chlorite, silica-epidote (\u00b1albite-chlorite-sericite), grunerite and albite-prehnite alteration zones in the footwall volcaniclastic rocks and arkoses and hangingwall turbidites, i.e., sandstones and shales. Ripidolite (chlorite) shows the widest spreading of predicted abundance with maximum occurrence between \u2264 \u223c55 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a070\u00a0vol% (Fig. 5a, b, ESM Fig. 1, 4a, b). The epidote zone comprises epidote (\u2264 \u223c40 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a055\u00a0vol%) and lesser albite, chlorite, calcite, and sericite (each \u2264 \u223c25\u00a0vol%). Grunerite constitutes\u00a0\u223c\u00a025 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a040\u00a0vol% of the lower and innermost grunerite alteration zone, while albite and prehnite are expected to increase in abundance towards the upper parts of the VMS. Numerical modeling predicts an occurrence between\u00a0\u223c\u00a055 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a060\u00a0vol% for albite and \u2264 \u223c35\u00a0vol% for prehnite, respectively, whereas in the other zones their abundance is\u00a0\u2264\u00a012\u00a0vol%. Pyrite has an almost persistent appearance between\u00a0\u223c\u00a05 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a025\u00a0vol% in all alteration zones (in agreement with the observed paragenesis given in Triantafyllidis et al., 2021, c.f., ESM 1, Tables\u00a01c and d and petrography and ESM Fig. 1g, sample EK 33, using a 22\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016 grid). Minor chalcopyrite and sphalerite (\u2264 \u223c2.5\u00a0vol%) and trace amounts of barite and galena are present (abundances are presented in ESM Table 2 and Fig. 5\na, b).\nFor the volcaniclastic rocks strong-to-medium gain of Na2O, CaO and Ba (silica-epidote and albite-prehnite zones, implying sodium and calcium metasomatism; also supported by the appearance of sulfohalite and burkeite as daughter minerals in fluid inclusions, ESM Fig. 7), as well as MgO, Fe2O3 and Cr (silica-chlorite zone, suggesting magnesium, ferrum and chromium metasomatism) and sulfur (as total) for the footwall volcaniclastic rocks is documented. The loss of K2O in the silica-chlorite zone for the footwall lithologies (ESM Fig. 8a) is interpreted, in part, because of hydrothermal remobilization from the volcaniclastic rocks (although with very low initial K2O content) and possible development of the silica-sericite zone (as traces in the overlying exhalites; c.f. ESM1 Table\u00a01b, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). The strong loss of sulfur in the silica-chlorite zone (ESM Fig. 8b) is attributed to its contribution from the turbidites (as also suggested by the sulfur isotopes reported by Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). The calculated gains and losses (ESM Table 3, Fig. 8a, b) are consistent with the Ermioni \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d VMS observed in the field, and predicted alteration norms (ESM Fig. 5a, b, 8a, b).\nOur geochemical modeling shows that for \u2248 0.5\u00a0g of titrated rock, and as water\/rock ratios decreased from\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800 (T\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0\u00b0C) to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0440 (T\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b0C), the predicted bulk of quartz (as the initial fluid was saturated in quartz) remains almost constant (at\u00a0\u223c\u00a070\u00a0vol% cumulative) marking the formation of the inner silica alteration zone and the stringer ore (Fig. 5a, ESM Table\u00a01, reaction 1). Then, there is sharp increase in the amount of precipitated ripidolite. Simultaneously, a decrease of the mass of quartz is recorded, marking the formation of the intermediate silica-chlorite zone. Ripidolite is spatially the most abundant alteration mineral (Fig. 5a, b). At this point pyrite is expected to co-precipitate with magnetite and pyrrhotite, followed by chalcopyrite (Fig. 5b). It is also suggested that the estimated logfO2 values were high enough to stabilize the pyrite-magnetite-pyrrhotite assemblage (for pH\u00a0\u2265\u00a03.9 and T\u00a0\u2264\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b0C). Pyrite and chalcopyrite continue to precipitate during the formation of silica-chlorite zone, although later sphalerite is predicted to be deposited.\nAs the system evolves and for \u2248 20\u00a0g of titrated rock (further decrease of water\/rock ratios down to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0180, at T\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00a0\u00b0C), there is a drop of predicted mass for both quartz and chlorite, highlighting the formation of the silica-epidote (\u00b1albite-chlorite-sericite) zone outwards the stringer ore (Fig. 5a, b, ESM Table\u00a01, reactions 5, 6). Epidote and minor sericite precipitate preferentially at the end of the simulation (Fig. 5a, ESM Table\u00a01, reactions 2, 5, 6). For this zone, there is a predicted decrease of the ripidolite and quartz abundances of\u00a0\u223c\u00a040 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u00a0wt% respectively, and an increase of the sericite abundance of\u00a0\u223c\u00a020\u00a0wt%. In the silica-epidote zone, albite, epidote, and calcite are expected to precipitate in total up to\u00a0\u223c\u00a040\u00a0wt% along with pyrite and chalcopyrite (Fig. 5a).\n\n\n5.1.3\nGeochemical mapping of fossilized Karakasi \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d VMS\nA geochemical mapping approach at present coordinates (Fig. 6\n) was employed to reconstruct the \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d VMS at Karakasi mine. Following Peter and Goodfellow (1996) and Peter and Scott (1999); Peter (2003), we have used as indexes the Eu (e.g., magmatic hydrothermal input) and Ce anomalies (e.g., seawater contamination), as well as the geochemical ratios Mn\/Mg (e.g., detrital input) and Ba\/K (e.g., proximity to the hydrothermal vents onto the paleo-seafloor).\nMapping of the Eu anomaly illustrates the site of the fossilized source for the ore-forming fluids which coincide with the location of the exploited VMS ores at Karakasi mine. As the Eu anomaly is strongly dependent on temperature, the Eu\/Eu* values (c.f. ESM Table\u00a03a, 3b, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021) are aligned to the Karakasi stringer ore (Fig. 6a), suggesting a drop of the temperature gradient moving away from the high-temperature venting sites (stringer ore). The Eu\/Eu* decrease is attributed to mixing with seawater, wall-rock interaction, cooling and dilution of the venting reduced (logfO2\u00a0=\u00a0HM-2.7 to HM-3.9 and logfS2\u00a0=\u00a0PP\u00a0+\u00a01.7 to PP-2.5) and slightly acidic ore-forming fluids (pH\u00a0=\u00a03.6 to 5.0). The ascent of the ore forming fluids occurred through the high-angle, normal faults that controlled the western margin of the deep-sea basin and followed a general NNE-SSW orientation (Fig. 6a, ESM Fig. 10).\nOur Ce\/Ce* contour mapping suggests that the lower values of this anomaly are detected along the major fault zone, which correspond to contemporary outcrops as the stringer ore. Seawater affected the surrounding lithologies at greater distances relative to the main venting sites (stringer ore), thus increasing the Ce\/Ce* ratios (Fig. 6b). The Mn\/Mg ratios are higher along a NW-SE orientation (Fig. 6d) with the highest values in the western part of the Karakasi VMS deposit. The values tend to decrease towards the NE, depicting the input of the detrital component (e.g., hangingwall turbidites, Fig. 6d). Moreover, this trend could also reflect the flanks of the VMS system affected by chloritization. Mapping of Ba\/K ratio suggests that main hydrothermal circulation most probably occurred in the W-SW of the Karakasi VMS (Fig. 6c). Combining our contour mapping results, it is implied that several hydrothermal conduits were active from 65.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 to 64.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma along NE-SW normal faults.\nThe geochemical mapping coincides to the hydraulic model developed for the Karakasi VMS site. Cold seawater infiltrates down through pathways to the less permeable volcaniclastic rocks, whereas the hot magmatic vapor-metal-laden ore fluid ascents towards the paleo-seafloor (Fig. 4). Fluid flow was channeled along the high-angle NE-trending normal faults of the Ermioni deep-sea basin, or their inner damage zone corresponding to zones of discharge and\/or recharge (Fig. 6). Fluid recharge occurred mainly in axial topographic depressions where cold seawater entered the system, was heated, and raised due to buoyancy flow and discharged with estimated velocities between 8.9 and 12.4\u00a0mm\/s. Geochemical mapping suggests that both the hydrothermal ore fluid and seawater most probably entered the plume from the NW (Fig. 6) which continued to rise and widen leading to lower temperature isotherms forming in the footwall and hangingwall rocks (from 200\u00b0 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm, Fig. 4c). Succeeding, colder seawater flew downwards and was heated up, whilst the hot magmatic fluids gradually circulated through the stringer ore and footwall-hangingwall boundary from the SE (Fig. 6).\n\n\n5.1.4\nNature and chemistry of ore-forming fluid\nThe Karakasi ore-forming fluid was potassium-calcium poor (T \u2248 360\u00a0\u00b0C) and ferrum-magnesium rich (T \u2248 330\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 2h). It comprises elevated log(Si4+\/Fe2+) and log(Si4+\/Cl-) values suggesting that the ascending magmatic ore-forming fluid was initially saturated in silica and undersaturated in Fe-chlorides, as evident by the mineralogy and texture of the innermost silica alteration zone and the stringer ore. Coarse-grained quartz of the stringer ore corresponds to early-stage deposition (rusty-reddish luminescence, ESM Fig. 2e) at temperatures from\u00a0\u223c\u00a0350\u00b0 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0430\u00a0\u00b0C and salinity of 3.1 to 10.4\u00a0wt% equivalent NaCl (Fig. 2e, the values of\u00a0\u223c\u00a03.2\u00a0wt% equivalent NaCl represent seawater, Hou et al., 2008). Interestingly, the fine-grained quartz (greenish luminescence, ESM Fig. 2e) depicts simple cooling at slightly lower temperatures (T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0410\u00b0 down to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0330\u00a0\u00b0C), yet the salinity is almost identical to the early-stage quartz (3.3 to 10.5\u00a0wt% equivalent NaCl). At the same time, mixing with seawater and cooling of the ore-forming fluid increased its log(Fe2+\/Cl-) ratio leading to pyrite precipitation. The Karakasi ore-forming fluid chemistry is comparable to the Fe-enriched, Hellyer, Tasmania stringer ore fluid (Zaw et al., 2003). The co-existence of the type I and II inclusions (e.g., sample EK12), and elevated positive log(XCO2\/XH2S) values of the ore fluid suggest degassing through a fault-related venting mechanism and entrapment of magmatic vapors (T\u00a0=\u00a0375\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C, with CO2\/CH4 ratio of\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5, Tables 1, 2, see also Shanks et al. (2012), c.f., Figs. 4-5 and 4-6), whereas the negative log(XCO2\/XCH4) values are attributed to post-entrapment effect of anchimetamorphism (T\u00a0=\u00a0320\u00a0\u00b0C, Table 3, Fig. 2g).\n\n\n\n5.2\nThermodynamic modeling of hydrothermal alteration at Karakasi VMS\nThe developed hydraulic model suggests that circulation in both the footwall and hangingwall provoked metasomatism and hydrothermal alteration. The hydrothermal fluid contributing to the plume is primarily of magmatic origin, vapor-rich, as evident by stable and radiogenic isotopes (e.g., sulfur isotopes and R\/RA ratios, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021) that mixed with seawater and circulated in the footwall and hangingwall rocks. A possible reaction path of the Karakasi is shown in Fig. 3a, b. Thermodynamic modeling suggests a systematic decrease of the log(\u03b1\nK\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+), log(\u03b1\nNa\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+), log[\u03b1\nCa\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2] and log[\u03b1\nMg\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2]. At temperatures between 350\u00b0 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C and pressure of 165 bars, five different alteration zones related to the massive and stringer ores overprint the volcaniclastic and sedimentary host rocks as shown in Fig. 4a and are consistent with the alteration zoning outcropping in the field (c.f., Fig. 4b, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). At 350\u00a0\u00b0C the ore-forming fluid initially equilibrates with grunerite (\u00b1chlorite, albite and prehnite) at lower pH (e.g., 3.6), and higher water-to-rock ratios (e.g., \u223c800). The formation of grunerite suggests ferrum metasomatism at the lower parts of the deposit (Fig. 4a). Then, at 300\u00a0\u00b0C prehnite, epidote and chlorite become stable. As the fluid further cools and interacts, i.e., at even higher pH and water-to-rock ratios (e.g., 5.0, \u223c21 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C) and lower log[\u03b1\nCa\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2] and log[\u03b1\nMg\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2] values the altering Ermioni ore fluid stabilizes epidote\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sericite, chlorite and calcite (Fig. 3a, b).\nThere is agreement between observed and modeled mineral abundances for the alteration zones (ESM Table\u00a03) which are also reported for the major VHMS deposits (see Shanks et al. 2012). As demonstrated by our modeling, silica-chlorite-epidote zonation is a function of pH and temperature at higher water\/rock ratios. As the initial temperature decreases and pH tends to neutralize, changes from chlorite- to epidote\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sericite-dominated assemblages are expected (Fig. 3a, b). It is also implied that the silica zone is related to silica supersaturation of the initial fluid (e.g., higher log(Si4+\/Fe2+), log(Si4+\/Cl-) values, Table 3), promoting silicification at higher water\/rock ratios (e.g., \u223c800, T\u00a0=\u00a0430\u00b0 to 370\u00a0\u00b0C, Table 3) in Karakasi stringer ore. Decreasing temperatures (from 350\u00b0 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C) and water\/rock ratios (e.g., \u223c440, T\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b0C) due to wall-rock interaction may lead to the formation of the chlorite-rich alteration zone surrounded by the epidote zone shell (even with limited exposure due to anchimetamorphism). Wall-rock interaction gradually raised the pH of the hydrothermal fluid in a way that grunerite and chlorite were stable when the fluid entered the faults. Subsequent formation of chlorite continued as the pH increased and the log[\u03b1\nMg\n2+\/(\u03b1\nH\n+)2] values decreased in the ore solution thus the fluid shifted towards epidote (Fig. 3).\n\n\n5.3\nOre deposition at Karakasi VMS\nOur solubility calculations (ESM Table\u00a01, reactions 14 to 16), combined to the mineralogical, textural, and geochemical characteristics of the Karakasi stringer, semi-massive and massive ore suggest that there is an isothermal decrease of pyrite solubility from 400\u00b0 down to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (although at T\u00a0\u2264\u00a0150\u00a0\u00b0C its solubility tends to increase) leading to continuous pyrite deposition (Fig. 3e, f). Pyrite shows the lowest solubility relative to chalcopyrite and sphalerite which follow either as traces or minor phases in the stringer and the semi-massive to massive ore, respectively. Sphalerite shows the highest solubility among these sulfides and only at low temperatures tends to precipitate. Hezarkhani et al. (1999) suggested that the solubility of iron and copper chlorides (for the assemblage pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chalcopyrite) maximizes at higher logfO2 and chlorine concentrations and lower pH. Mild oxidizing conditions (Fig. 4c, 5c, see also c.f., Table 1, Koschinsky et al., 2008) prevailed at higher temperatures (e.g., T\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00b0 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C, e.g., stages I and II, Tables 2, 3), whereas at lower temperatures (T\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00b0 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C), and with continuous deposition, the conditions shifted to more reducing (Fig. 3f). As temperature decreases and pH neutralize, there is a reduction of the \u03b1Cl\n-, logfO2 and \u03b1H2S(aq) values of the ore fluid due to seawater influx (ESM Tables 1 and 2).\nOur modeling shows that at 300\u00a0\u00b0C, pyrite and chalcopyrite precipitation (Fig. 3e, stage I) is controlled by the formation reactions which involve iron and copper chlorides (ESM Table\u00a02, reactions 17 and 18 and Raman data, Table 3). The equilibrium constants of these reactions are defined as: logk1\u00a0=\u00a02log\u03b1\nH2S(aq)\u00a0+\u00a0log(\u03b1\nFeCl\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+)\u00a0+\u00a0log(\u03b1\nCuCl\n0\/\u03b1\nH\n+)\u00a0+\u00a02pH \u2212 2log\u03b1\nCl\n-\n(aq). Utilizing the thermodynamic data for iron and copper chlorides provided by Casadevall and Ohmoto (1977) (c.f., Table 7), the above equation, at 300\u00a0\u00b0C, takes the form log(\u03b1\nFeCl\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+)\u00a0=\u00a0-3.4 - log(\u03b1\nCuCl\n0\/\u03b1\nH\n+), suggesting that as pH increases (e.g., from 3.6 to 5.0) both the activities of the log\u03b1\nCuCl\n0 and log\u03b1\nFeCl\n+ are expected to decrease. However, it is evident that the log(\u03b1\nCuCl\n0\/\u03b1\nH\n+) values tend to increase as the log(\u03b1\nFeCl\n+\/\u03b1\nH\n+) decrease (Fig. 3f), favoring the deposition of chalcopyrite, mainly as unhedral crystals filling cracks and voids between previously formed pyrite (for more details see Triantafyllidis et al., 2021).\nAt lower temperatures (T\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00b0 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C) and with continuing ore deposition, the conditions shifted to more reducing (Fig. 3f, where the red line depicts the possible evolution of the ore-forming fluids). Based on Fig. 3f, the ore fluid follows the pyrite-chalcopyrite boundary depicting the formation of chalcopyrite after the precipitation or possible dissolution of pyrite, a state confirmed by the texture and mineralogy of the Ermioni massive-to-semi massive ore (c.f., Figs. 7, 8, 9, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). As temperature drops, the ore-fluid chemistry becomes more sensitive to the changes of redox conditions, i.e., logfO2 decrease which leads to higher CuCl0\n(aq) activities and precipitation of chalcopyrite (Seward et al., 2014). For the ore fluid to precipitate solely pyrite e.g., reaction 15 (ESM Table\u00a01, Fig. 1c) must exclusively turn to the left. To accomplish these distinct conditions, there must be massive input of log\u03b1\nFeCl\n+ into the ore fluid causing its supersaturation, as temperature, logfO2, logfS2 and logaH2S(aq) tend to decrease and pH to increase (Fig. 3a, b, c, d, e). The chemistry of the ore-forming fluids (e.g., Si4+ \u2264 \u223c 1710 and Mg+2 \u2264 \u223c 140\u00a0ppm, Table 3) is closely related to the volcaniclastic and ophiolite lithologies leached by hydrothermal convection. The Ermioni VMS setting is characterized by mafic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks and ultramafic blocks found as olistoliths in the ore forming Upper Cretaceous Ermioni basin, resulting in Fe-(\u00b1Mg) rich fluids, thus provoking continuous pyrite deposition in all stages and at all temperature intervals (Fig. 3e, f, 5c and 6a, b, c, d).\nA distinctive feature of the atypical Karakasi VMS is that it comprises almost monomineralic pyrite (\u226595\u00a0vol%, Fig. 3c, d). The magnitude of pyritization observed in Karakasi suggests that besides the massive input of dissolved Fe in the ore-forming fluids, sulfidation during cooling between\u00a0\u223c\u00a0370\u00b0 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0250\u00a0\u00b0C may have played an important role during the VMS formation (Fig. 4c). Our modeling suggests a seawater input of up to 35\u00a0vol% in the Ermioni VMS system (Fig. 4d), also supported by Barrie et al. (1999) which reported that the ore-forming fluids in the \u201cMafic-Pelitic\u201d hydrothermal systems comprise always mixtures of hot magmatic fluids with cold seawater. In our case, seawater contamination may have shifted the fraction of the Fe- and Cu-chloride complexing towards hydrosulfide\/sulfide-complexing.\nLate-stage sulfidation in the Karakasi VMS system is also supported by the venting zonation observed at the conduit walls comprising inner pyrite and outer chalcopyrite (ESM Fig. 6a, b), the XFeS% contents of sphalerite and calculated \u03b434SH2S values (c.f., ESM 1, Table 4b and Table 2, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021) and the absence of sulfates, e.g., traces of barite, anhydrite, and gypsum (resembling the VMS deposits in the southern Iberian Pyrite Belt, Tornos et al., 2015). This modification most probably resulted in a gradual increase of the metal-to-sulfide and Cu\/Fe ratios of the ore-forming fluid. Sulfidation due to seawater contamination would have significantly decreased the log\u03b1HS\n\u2013\n(aq) and \u03b1Cl\n-, values of the Karakasi VMS ore fluid. Under these conditions, an incremental increase of its log\u03b1\nFeCl\n+ values is expected (ESM Table\u00a01, reaction 15), and thereby promote the exclusive precipitation of pyrite. Moreover, the widespread precipitation of stringer pyrite (Fig. 3e, f, 4a, c) has also led the log\u03b1\nCuCl\n0 values to increase, leading to later chalcopyrite deposition (ESM Table\u00a01, reaction 16). Such increase of the log\u03b1\nCuCl\n0 values is supported by the VMS ore mineralogy and texture with fine-grained, anhedral chalcopyrite (\u00b1sphalerite) cementing the pyrite-predominant ore (c.f. Figs. 7, 8, 9, Triantafyllidis et al., 2021). These unambiguous conditions are achieved when higher discharge temperatures (between 350\u00b0 and 430\u00a0\u00b0C, Table 2) are sustained for prolonged periods, i.e., for Karakasi between 65.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 and 64.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma and an immense portion of accumulated Fe and Cu is dissolved, i.e., carried away by discharging fluids and lost to the seawater column, leading to a VMS deposit comprising mainly pyrite.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe results of the geochemical, thermodynamic, and hydraulic modeling of the Karakasi stringer ore in Ermioni VMS are summarized below:\n\n\u2022\nThe Karakasi stringer ore precipitated from a CO2-CH4-Si-Mg-Fe-bearing ore-forming fluid with pH\u00a0=\u00a03.6 to 5.0 and logfO2 and logfS2 values between HM-2.7 and HM-3.9 and PP\u00a0+\u00a01.7 and PP-2.5, at temperatures and salinity between 330\u00b0 and 430\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0\u223c\u00a02 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent, respectively and at a hydrostatic pressure of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0165 bars.\n\n\n\u2022\nSimple cooling from T\u00a0\u223c\u00a0410\u00b0 down to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0330\u00a0\u00b0C, wall-rock interaction with decreasing water-to-rock ratios from\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800 down to\u00a0\u223c\u00a020 and seawater contamination up to 35\u00a0vol% were the mechanisms contributed to the observed alteration patterns, i.e., silica, silica-chlorite, silica-epidote (\u00b1albite-chlorite-sericite), grunerite and albite-prehnite zones and abundances.\n\n\n\u2022\nAs highest water\u2013rock ratios (e.g., \u223c 800) occurred around the normal faults, it is implied that at these sites that represent the vents, higher fault permeability and fluid velocities, water\u2013rock interaction and duration of fluid circulation predominate, provoking the precipitation of pyrite in the Karakasi stringer ore.\n\n\n\u2022\nRemobilization of Fe, Mg and Cu from the footwall volcaniclastic rocks and ultramafic rocks, the latter found as blocks within the Ermioni Complex, combined to sulfidation led to the increase of the log\u03b1\nFeCl\n+ and then of the log\u03b1\nCuCl\n0 values, and provoked the precipitation of almost monomineralic pyrite as temperature decreased to 300\u00a0\u00b0C and pH increased in both the stringer and the overlying semi-massive to massive ore.\n\n\n\u2022\nHydraulic modeling suggests the formation of hydrothermal plumes, as evident by the 300\u00b0 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms, with mainly inwards ore-fluid circulation and along the normal faults in the Ermioni Upper Cretaceous basin.\n\n\n\nOur study establishes thermodynamic, geochemical and hydraulic modeling as a robust implement to reconstruct and explore the evolution of the fossilized Karakasi VMS, regarding its channelized flow conduits, fluid chemistry, discharge temperatures and alteration zoning. Herein, field evidence combined with modeling and geochemical mapping can assist in designing new exploration targets on potential unexposed VMS sites, or VMS deposits distal to known heat sources in rift-related, back-arc geotectonic settings.\n\n","5":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nBarite deposits are widely distributed in space and time and occur in a diverse range of geological environments, including marine (Monnin and Cividini, 2006), sedimentary (Kontak et al., 2006; Deb and Pal, 2015), metamorphic (Hanor, 2000), magmatic (Williams Jones et al., 2000) and hydrothermal vein deposits (Okubo et al., 2020; Nadoll et al., 2019; Margoum et al.,2015; Walter et al., 2019, 2020; Muller and Ehle, 2021). Hydrothermal vein-type deposits usually occur in the vicinity of rift valleys, basement-cover unconformities, and large-scale crustal lineaments or fault systems (Walter et al., 2020 and references therein). Vein-type barite mineralization also formed under a wide range of pressure, temperature, and different fluid sources in a broad geological time domain (Hanor, 2000; Staude et al., 2011, Walter et al., 2020, Zou et al.,2021).\nFluid mixing between hot basement brines and cooler, shallower sediment-derived fluids under oxidized and reduced conditions is one of the most accepted mechanisms in hydrothermal systems in the ore-forming process (Chen,2013; Bons et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2020). Barite occurs as a vein\/gangue mineral typically associated with lead-zinc-fluorite mineralization (Magnall et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2017, 2021; Brusnitsyn et al.,2022). Barite (BaSO4) exchange with celestite (SrSO4) is typical (Hanor, 2000); hence it is an excellent petrogenetic mineral used for understanding the radiogenic Sr isotope composition of hydrothermal systems and a fluid source.\nWorldwide, the extensional rift-related basins in continental settings are characterized by a variety of hydrothermal mineralization starting from vein type, stratiform, strata-bound, disseminated to massive polymetallic ores (Deb and Goodfellow, 2004). Barite vein deposits are known to occur in or near the margin of extensional rift basins. Barite is widespread globally, and the Indian shield is also bestowed with massive deposits. Only a few published literature is available on these Indian deposits (Deb et al.,1991; Muller et al., 2017 and references therein). In the Indian shield, barite mineralization is known from Palaeo Archaean to the Neoproterozoic age. In Southern India, the Dharwar Craton (the Sargur Group of Western Dharwar Craton and Nellore Schist Belt of Eastern Dharwar Craton) is well known for its stratiform barites (Neelakantam1987; Deb et al., 1991; Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan, 1997; Muller et al., 2017). The hydrothermal vein barites are reported from Mangampet, Cuddapah Supergroup (Vemapalle-Vellidandla; Kolhapur areas), Pakhal Supergroup (Shernawala, Khammam areas) (George et al., 2013), and alkaline complexes of Southern Granulite Terrain (Harur-Alangayam) and Western Bastar craton, Central India (Chande and Rao,1983; Dora,2012).\nThe previous studies on barite from the Bastar craton, central India, were mainly focused on preliminary exploration and genesis (Chande and Rao,1983; Deshmukh et al., 1995; Dora,2012; Randive et al., 2021). However, a detailed characterization of barite types, ore-forming processes, and the source of ore-forming fluids have not been studied so far. The Proterozoic PG rift basin, which is tectonically juxtaposed against the Dharwar Craton in the west and the Bastar Craton in the east (Fig. 1\na and b), preserves the record of repeated opening and closing (Naqvi and Rogers 1987; Meshram et al., 2021), associated with barite mineralization. Hence, structural control of barites in the study area also needs to be understood.\nIn view of the above, we use a comprehensive field and petrography study integrated with mineral and bulk rock geochemistry, fluid inclusion chemistry, and a combination of Strontium and Sulfur isotopes in order to: (1) characterize the barite mineralization along with fault\/fracture systems; (2) establish the path and source of the ore-forming fluid and; (3) understand the ore genetic process concerning PG rift basin evolution and Proterozoic granite magmatism. The present study will be helpful for better understanding the formation of fault-controlled barite-galena mineralisation and as a general framework for exploring similar deposits in other terranes, including the northern flank of the PG rift basin.\n\n1.1\nGeological background\nThe study area is a part of the Bastar Craton in central India. The craton is essentially composed of ca. 3.60\u20133.51\u00a0Ga Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) suites, granites, amphibolite, and Proterozoic supracrustals with 2.5\u00a0Ga granite gneisses and mafic dykes (Sarkar et al., 1993; Ghosh, 2004; Ramachandra 2004; Rajesh et al., 2009; Santosh et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2021). The older gneiss-supracrustal assemblages are intruded by 1.6\u00a0Ga granitoid plutons of varying dimensions and are traversed by numerous quartz-chlorite-barite veins (Ramachandra 2004; Dora and Randive, 2015; Dora et al., 2020, 2021; Fig. 2\na\u2013c). The NW-SE trending and 450\u00a0km long Proterozoic PG rift basin occur at the tectonic juncture of the Dharwar and the Bastar cratons (Fig. 1b) (Santosh et al., 2004; Meshram et al., 2021). The basin constitutes the most important Proterozoic rift basin in the Southern Indian craton and records the history of recurrent rifting from Proterozoic onward (Naqvi and Rogers1987). The PG basin preserves Paleoproterozoic thick sedimentary and Paleozoic-Mesozoic Gondwana succession records unconformably overlying the Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic basement (Chaudhuri et al., 2015). The basin is flanked on its outer margin by Archaean granulites (>2500\u00a0Ma, Santosh et al., 2004) and granitoid basement complex (Fig. 1b). Previously, Fluorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0barite (30\u201370 % CaF2) mineralization has been reported along the fault demarcating the contact between PG rift basin and Gondwana rocks, near Dongargaon (about 60\u00a0km NW of the present study area; Deshmukh et al., 1995; Randive et al., 2021) and Sironcha (about 60\u00a0km SE of the present study area; GSI, 1970) areas (Fig. 1b). Iron ore mineralization along this boundary fault has also been reported in the Gajoli area (Rao et al., 2020 and references therein). The barite mineralization under study is located at the northern shoulder of the PG basin in the Western Bastar Craton and occurs along the boundary faults and a set of faults sub-parallel and also at a high angle to the boundary faults (Fig. 1a and b). The study area's rock types comprised ca.2.5\u00a0Ga TTG gneisses, charnockites, and mafic-ultramafics intruded by 1.62\u00a0Ga Mul granite (Dora et al., 2019). The TTG and granitic pluton provide the basement for the PG basin's younger sedimentary rocks. The lithological assemblages of the PG basin exhibit signature of continental to deep marine depositional environments (Rao et al., 2020). The Somanpalli Group in the PG basin's eastern and northern belts comprises mixed carbonate-siliciclastic assemblages.\nThe Mul granite in the area is undeformed and essentially of two types: (1) unaltered plagioclase-rich monzogranite (composed of quartz, plagioclase, microcline, hornblende, biotite, and opaque) and (2) potash metasomatized altered granite (composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, hornblende, biotite and opaque; Fig. 2c).\n\n\n1.2\nStructure and mineralization\nThe study area's TTG gneisses and charnockite basement is traversed by several folds-faults-structures (Fig. 3\na\u2013h). The NNE-SSW trending series of antiforms and synforms is among the earliest structures (Fig. 3a, e). The average axial plane trend of one such upright, horizontal antiform is 36\/87SE (n\u00a0=\u00a0102) with a fold axis plunge of 4\u00b0 northeasterly (Fig. 3a and e). Basement rock contains lenticular NE-SW trending mafic enclaves conformable to the country rocks' regional structure (Fig. 3g). Three generations of fault systems traverse the area (Dora, 2012). The earliest faults (F1) series is oriented in the 22\/56NW direction (Fig. 3b\u2013d; n\u00a0=\u00a031). Details are given in Supplementary Material (Annexure-1). These faults and folds were later displaced by a set of faults sub-parallel to the N-S trending boundary fault(F2). The boundary fault, belonging to the regional rift system, defines the contact between the TTG gneisses and Charnockites country rock with Mesoproterozoic PG valley sediments. The study area's most prominent F2-series of faults is the Thanewasna fault, having an attitude of 346\/57SW (n\u00a0=\u00a035). The plan shows sinistral movement sense, whereas, on the fault plane, the mean of slickenside is 11 towards S12oW, indicating the NE block as an upthrown block (Fig. 3e and f). This Thanewasna fault is well known for hosting an iron oxide-gold-copper (IOCG)\u2013type deposit in the Thanewasna-Ghanpur area (Fig. 3a; Dora et al., 2020). The boundary fault is traversed by a number of cross faults (F3). These F3 fault systems are traceable within the country rocks as well as in the PG valley sediments (Fig. 3g). Field observation shows that barite mineralization is preferentially distributed along the two fault systems, viz., F2, and F3(Figs. 2 and 3), extending upto 200 to 300\u00a0m along strike and 5\u201315\u00a0m width. Mineralization along faults, parallel and sub-parallel to F2 and F3 systems and of local extent in areas such as Jamb Tukum, Naleshwar, Dongarhaldi, and Gomtukum, was also earlier reported by many workers (Sashidharan, 2007; Mukherjee et al., 2007; Dora et al., 2017; Kaushik et al., 2019; Fig. 2b and c).\nThe barite mineralization occurs as veins, stringers, and fracture fillings associated with quartz-calcite veins (Fig. 2c and Fig. 4\na\u2013f). Mineralization mainly consists of barite, quartz, calcite, fluorite, galena, and chalcopyrite. Based on the field relation, mineralogical and textural characteristics, three distinct types of barite mineralization were observed in the area. These are: (1) thick veins without sulfides (Brt-I) (Fig. 4a and b); (ii) open-space filling veins with sulfides (Brt-II) (Fig. 4c), and (iii) barites associated with fluorite postdate iron alteration (Brt-III; Fig. 4e). The open-space fillings and veinlets are the primary barite mineralization associated with galena, pyrite, and chalcopyrite (Fig. 4c). Occurrences of Brt-I and Brt-II are predominant. On the contrary, Brt-III occurs in minor concentrations. Barite is generally dark reddish-brown, pink, white, and flesh color also observed (Fig. 4a\u2013f). Barites having white and pink colored crystals encrusting voids suggest a hydrothermal alteration in the form of silicification and hematitisation in the area. Galena occurs in small crystalline grains (upto 1\u00a0cm).\n\n\n\n2\nMaterial and analytical methods\nField studies were performed to establish ore\/host rock's field and structural relations during barite mineralization. Samples were collected for petrographic studies, major oxides, trace element and REE analysis, and isotope studies. Structural analyses were performed using stereographic projection (equal area, lower hemisphere) for folds and faults present in the study area and are summarized in Supplementary Material (Annexure-1). A detailed petrographic study was conducted by examining 50 thin polished sections from the mineralized zone, some of which were also used for the microprobe analysis. About five grab samples from barite outcrops were processed for whole-rock geochemical studies. Brief information on the instrumental setup, analytical protocol, and operating conditions related to Electron Microprobe Analyses (EPMA), Major, trace and Fluid analyses techniques, Sulfur isotope and Sr- isotope measurements are summarized in Supplementary Material (Annexure-2).\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nPetrography and mineral chemistry\nBarite is the primary and dominant ore mineral. It is mostly euhedral shaped (Fig. 5\na and b). Modally, veins contain\u00a0\u2013\u00a060\u201370\u00a0vol% barite, \u223c10\u201320\u00a0vol% quartz-calcite, and 1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0vol% sulfide minerals in the form of primary galena, chalcopyrite, and chalcocite. The K-feldspar in the host Mul granite is intensely altered (Fig. 5b). BSE images of K-feldspar show alteration along its grain margin and probably release Ba in granite (Fig. 5b and c). Due to the remobilization of silicates and sulfides along the fractures by hydrothermal fluids, significant network textures were observed in barites. Chalcopyrite inclusions in barite were altered to chalcocite and Cu-oxides (Fig. 5f).\nThree-stage mineral paragenesis was recognized based on mineralogical, textural and cross-cutting relationships. The first stage is characterized by bunches and dissemination of coarse-grained euhedral sulfide-free barites (Fig. 5a and b). The second stage of paragenesis is irregular aggregates, composed of medium-grained barites associated with galena and pyrite (Fig. 5c\u2013e). The third stage is post-mineralization barite which occurs with minor secondary copper sulfides such as chalcocite (Fig. 5e), malachite and oxide as cuprite (Fig. 5f). Except from the high BaSO4 content (from 79.72 to 89.75\u00a0wt%), barite exhibits low concentration of major oxides such as SiO2 (7.46 to 17.37\u00a0wt%), Al2O3 (0.50 to 0.56\u00a0wt%), TiO2 (0.18 to 0.20\u00a0wt%), MgO (0.10\u00a0wt%), K2O (0.05\u00a0wt%), Na2O (0.46 to 0.50\u00a0wt%) and Fe2O3 (0.50\u00a0wt%). P2O5 and MnO occur in very low concentrations (Table 1\n). Details are given in Supplementary Material (Annexures-3 and 4). Galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and barite composition was determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Details are given in Supplementary Material (Annexure-5).\n\n\n3.2\nTrace and rare earth elements geochemistry of barites\nThe bedrock of barite veins shows Ba, Zn, Cu, and Pb in variable concentrations. The Ba content in barite shows a large variation from 35.40 to 58.39\u00a0wt% (Fig. 6\nd). The REE concentrations in barite are given in Table1. The \u03a3REE contents in barite are low (from 0.0048 to 0.0145\u00a0wt%). Significant variation in \u03a3REE contents have been observed between sulfide-bearing barite (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a00.0019\u00a0wt% or 109\u00a0ppm) and sulfide-free barite (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a00048\u00a0wt% or 48\u00a0ppm). The REE patterns were normalized with the chondrite REE concentrations (Boynton, 1984). The Eu anomaly is determined as E\/E* = (Eu\/Eu\nN\n)\/[(Sm\/Sm\nN\n)0.5-(Gd\/Gd\nN\n)0.5]. REE patterns of barite display a strong\u00a0+\u00a0ve Eu anomaly (Fig. 6e). The LREE enrichment relative to the HREE anomaly is calculated as (La\/Yb)\nN\n=(La\/La\nN\n)\/(Yb\/Yb\nN\n) following Braun et al. (1998). The REE patterns of barite show the enrichment of LREE over HREE as shown by (La\/Yb)N ratios ranging between1.2 and 7.0 (Fig. 6e). Moreover, the chondrite-normalized REE shows a \u201cV\u201d shaped pattern with mild negative Ce anomaly.\n\n\n3.3\nMicrothermometry and Raman spectroscopy\nAbundant fluid inclusions are hosted in Barite and are of irregular and faceted habits. Both primary and secondary fluid inclusions were identified based on the criteria suggested by Roedder (1984) and Shepherd et al. (1985). The size of inclusions varies from 1.25 to 45.86\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 7\n). The results of fluid inclusion microthermometry are presented in Table 2\n.\nTwo types of inclusions were identified in barites (1) primary aqueous bi-phase inclusions as Fluid Inclusion Assemblage-I (FIA-I) and (2) primary aqueous carbonic inclusions as FIA-II (Type-II; Fig. 7a\u2013d). The FIA-I are frozen at temperatures that vary from \u221255\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221275\u00a0\u00b0C,and that of FIA-II fluctuates from \u221228 to \u221235\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 8\na). The fluid inclusion homogenization temperature (Th) falls from the 152\u00a0\u00b0C to 310\u00a0\u00b0C spans with a mean Th value of 201\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 8b). First, ice melting temperature (Te) for fluid inclusions ranges between \u221257\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221230.0\u00a0\u00b0C with an average of \u221245.5\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating the main component as CaCl2 in the fluid system (Fig. 8a). The maximum Te of \u221257\u00a0\u00b0C suggests CaCl2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0MgCl2 with NaCl and H2O (Shepered et al., 1985). The last ice melting temperature (Tm, ice) for inclusions varies from \u22120.2\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221231.5\u00a0\u00b0C with an average of \u221214.09\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 8d). Salinities calculated from the Tm, ice fall in the range of 0.33 to 28.06\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. (Fig. 8e and Fig. 9\na and b). The aqueous density fluctuates from 0.86 to 1.13 gm\/cm3, with an average of 1.00 gm\/cm3 (Fig. 8f). Salinity measured ranges from 0.33 to 2.96\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. in FIA-I inclusions and that in FIA-II from 13.9 to 28.06\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. (Fig. 9c). FIA-II's high salinity range and low salinity range in FIA-I correspond to sulfide-free (Brt-I) and sulfide-bearing (Brt-II) barites.\nThe Laser Raman analysis results also indicate both vapor and H2O dominate all the inclusions (Fig. 10\na and b). All fluid inclusion assemblages are composed of H2O \u2013 CO2 volatiles with gaseous phases present in small quantities in the form of SO2 (peak in 1138; Fig. 10a, c and d). Inclusions in sulfide-bearing barites (i.e., FIA-I) also involves a small amount of CH4 (peak in 1650; Fig. 10c and d).\n\n\n3.4\nRadiogenic and stable isotopic composition\nSulfur isotope composition has been obtained for ten representative barite and six galena samples. The \u03b434S values for barite samples range from 10.31 to 15.19\u2030 and galena from 0.18 to 2.74\u2030 (Fig. 11\nb; Table 3\n). These \u03b434S values are compared with global deposits formed by a wide range of geological processes (Fig. 11c\u2013e) and discussed under section 4.1.1.\nStrontium isotope analysis has been carried out for ten barite samples, and the results are summarized in Table 3. The Sr concentration shows a wide range from 694\u00a0ppm to 2819\u00a0ppm. The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of barite samples fall between 0.706075 and 0.720412 (Table 3). Two main groups can be distinguished in frequency histogram (Fig. 12\na); (1) relatively high 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.715611\u20130.720412 in sulfide-free barites (Brt-I) and (2) relatively low 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.706075\u20130.707791 in sulfide-bearing barites (Brt-II) (Fig. 12a). The average 87Sr\/86Sr value obtained for the Standard (SRM-987) is 0.71059\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00002 against the reported 87Sr\/86Sr value of 0.71034. The Sr isotope ratio (87Sr\/86Sr) of global barite deposits was plotted and compared with the present study in Fig. 12b and discussed under section 4.1.1.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nGeochemistry\n\n4.1.1\nSulfur and strontium source constraints from S-Sr isotopes\nWorldwide, the S and Sr isotope ratios have been used in deciphering sources for mineralized fluids (Valenza et al., 2000; Marchev et al., 2002; Chen,2013). The sulfur isotopic compositions of barite and associated galena are heterogeneous, spanning two distinct clusters (Fig. 11a). The \u03b434S value of barites (10.31 to 15.19\u2030) is lower than seawater and closely overlaps with evaporite sources (Fig. 11c; Kontak, 2006). This range of \u03b434S values also roughly matches with hydrothermal barites (having \u03b434S values in the range of 1.5\u201320.0\u2030; Staude et al., 2011). The lower values of \u03b434S\u2030 may be related to the influx of seawater mixed up with the hydrothermal fluid. This \u03b434S range of barites from the study area resembles those previously studied elsewhere (Fig. 11b; Paytan et al., 1998; Claypol et al., 1980; Derakhshi et al., 2019). In contrast to the barites, the \u03b434S of galena shows a narrow range (from\u00a0+0.18 to 3.0 \u2030; Fig. 11a). The difference between the average \u03b434S values of galena and barite is 10\u2030. These contrasting \u03b434S values from barites and galena suggest two different sources of sulfur. Sulfides (galena) possess light isotope, and residual sulfate (e.g., barite) has a heavy isotope having a common source of sulfur from magmatic rocks but show wide isotopic variation due to change in reducing and oxidizing conditions (Schlegel et al.,2017). Moreover, the positive values in galena indicate that the total sulfur could have been derived from magmatic rocks, i.e., Mul granite or thermally-driven abiotic sulfate reduction (TSR) (e.g., Bechtel et al., 1996; Sheppard and Charef 1990; Fig. 11b and d). However, barite veins\u2019 field disposition and epigenetic signature postdate the host ca.1.62\u00a0Ga granite (Dora et al., 2019). The presence of sulfide-free barite in nearby Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of PG valley suggests a direct reduction of sulfate from seawater. Therefore, the sulfate is more likely to be the inorganic reduction of marine sulfate or inorganic fractionation of sulfur, probably caused by hydrothermal activity (i.e., Schlegel et al.,2017) (Fig. 11d). The significant variation of \u03b4 34S in galena and barite argues against a single source for sulfur. The source for the hydrotherms responsible for the formation of barite and galena in association with the quartz-barite vein is in all probability granitic magma. Incompatiable elements like Ba, Pb and volatiles like S are preferentially concentrated in late magmatic hydrothermal fluids got emplaced along the structurally weak zones in the interior of the granite pluton. Moreover, external fluids, mainly basinal brines and modified seawater commonly having high \u03b434S values (>+10\u2030), play a significant role in the ore-forming systems (Chen, 2013). Two possible sources of S can be postulated for our study area: those in the pre and main mineralizing fluids were derived from magmatic sources, while those in the post-mineralizing fluids were predominantly of non-magmatic origin.\nBarite occurs in different ore-forming environments associated with various mineral deposits (Fig. 11c and e). Barite from Sedex-type deposits is generally stratified with \u03b4\n34 S value in 19.7\u201333.6 and 32.3\u201341.6 \u2030 (Mao et al., 2003). Volcanic massive sulfide deposits show \u03b434S in the range of 13.8\u201322.5 \u2030 (Lydon, 1984), and those associated with orogenic and Carlin-type gold deposits show variable \u03b434S. The early formed barite is characterized by 25.9\u201347.1\u2030 \u03b434S and that of late formed with 14.5\u201339.4\u2030 \u03b434S (Groves et al., 2003). Sulfur in MVT-style deposits, derived from evaporite source, have \u03b434S in the range of 9.6 to 15\u2030 (Kontak et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2021; Brusnitsyn et al.,2022). Our \u03b434S data closely resembles MVT-type barite deposits (Fig. 11e). Moreover, barite veins don\u2019t show any sedimentary structures but display epigenetic\u2013hydrothermal vein-type characteristics. Such features are essential characteristics of fault-controlled vein-type barite mineralization (Walter et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2021; Alaminia et al.,2021 ). Moreover, \u03b434S values of galena and barite from our study area resemble the magmatic source of hydrothermal sulfur of Prominent Hill deposits, Australia (Schlegel et al.,2017).\nThe strontium isotope geochemistry (87Sr\/86Sr) of barite helps in characterizing the source and the origin of mineralized fluids (Kesler et al., 1988; Barbieri et al., 1987). It reflects the isotopic ratio of the fluid as the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio either fractionates below 400\u00a0\u00b0C or during crystallization or dissolution by the hydrothermal process (Matter et al., 1987). Moreover, the parent of 87Sr, i.e., 87Rb, generally, doesn\u2019t incorporate >100 ppb in the crystal lattice of barite (Hofmann and Baumann, 1984); accordingly, the Sr composition in barite don\u2019t change drastically over time.\nThe Sr values depict two distinct spans, i.e. (1) Brt-I, i.e., sulfide-free barite and (2) Brt-II, i.e., sulfide-bearing barite, in the present study area (Fig. 12a). The moderate to high 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of Brt-I (from 0.715611 to 0.719785) suggests deposition by hydrothermal solutions interacted with crustal brine (Galindo et al., 1994) and resembles the cratonic rift deposits types (Maynard et al.,1995). In contrast, the low 87Sr\/86Sr isotopic ratio (from 0.706075 to 0.707791) of Brt-II is indicative of deposition by Mesoproterozoic seawater (Veizer et al., 1989) resembles the continental margin type (Deb et al.,1991). The Sr isotopic compositions of barite measured in some other deposits showed a similar ratio (Zou et al., 2017, 2021 and reference therein), and, consequently, the identity of the source of the mineralising fluids. These sulfide-bearing barites formed from seawater show low salinity (as shown in Fig. 9c). This heterogenous 87Sr\/86Sr ratio is again suggestive of a mixed source of magmatic, seawater, meteoric, and hydrothermal fluid for studied barite samples (Fig. 12b and c). Staude et al. (2011) suggested that a high 87Sr\/86Sr isotopic compositions (i.e.,>0.707) are indicative of a basement-derived crustal brine, whereas the lower radiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr composition (i.e.,<0.707) characterize sedimentary cover fluid. The underlying basement rocks of WBC, i.e., TTG or Mul granite or both, is the possible source of high Sr isotopic composition. Simultaneously, Mesoproterozoic seawater is the probable source for low radiogenic Sr compositions for studied barite samples. A comparative study of barites from the study area with barites from Cuddapah basin, Ton valley of Lesser Himalaya, Aravalli Craton and Mangampeta of India, Mykonos intrusion of Greece and Schwarzwald of SW Germany is presented in Fig. 12b. Despite their different geodynamic settings, these deposits show significant similarities with central India's barite deposits (Fig. 12b).\n\n\n4.1.2\nBarium source constraints from REE geochemistry\nDifferent minerals have different REE abundances and geochemical behaviour. Therefore, REE characteristics are an important tool for tracking the mineralisation processes and material sources (Gong et al., 2018 and Zou et al., 2021). In general, barite has been reported from marine as well as terrestrial environments (Monnin and Cividini 2006). Marine and non-marine barites can be differentiated based on total REE concentrations and their patterns. High concentrations of rare earth elements characterize deep-marine barite, while land and hydrothermal barites exhibit lower total REE concentrations. Barite formed from seawater shows a 'V' pattern and negative Ce anomaly in REE pattern (Guichard et al., 1979). Guichard et al. (1979) suggested that marine barites generally have 10\u2013100 times more REE content than barite formed in continents. Moreover, marine barites have low Ce\/La ratio (Ce\/La\u00a0=\u00a00.33) in comparison to those of terrestrial barite (Ce\/La\u00a0=\u00a01.37; Church and Bernat (1972)). The low \u03a3REE content of barites (0.0048 to 0.0145 %), Chondrite normalized V-shaped REE pattern with mild negative Ce anomaly, and low Ce\/La ratios (from 0.6 to 2.5) suggest hydrothermal barites with marine influence (Baioumy, 2015 and references therein).\nMoreover, the presence of Sm and Eu anomalies reveals a redox condition at the loci of the barite formation. The low total REE concentration of barites from the study area suggests their possible hydrothermal origin is similar to those reported from Southern California\u2019s continental rift margin (cf. Hein et al., 2007). Hydrothermal vein types are further evidenced with fracture filling or network textures in barites (Fig. 5c and d).\n\n\n\n4.2\nNature and evolution of ore fluids\nFluid inclusion data on salinity versus homogenization temperature discrimination diagram (Fig. 9c) suggests that the fluid was homogenized at moderate to high temperatures and high salinities in the early-stage followed by moderate temperature with low salinity in the later stage. The contrasting salinity ranges of FIA-I and FIA-II indicate extensive mixing of meteoric, magmatic and hydrothermal fluids in the system. The high salinity with high homogenization temperature of FIA-I suggests that fluid immiscibility occurs before trapping (Shepherd et al., 1985). The coexistence of aqueous inclusions (i.e., FIA-I) with aqueous carbonic inclusions (i.e., FIA-II) might have happened at the closing stage of crystallization (Roedder 1984). The eutectic temperature (Te from \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221257\u00a0\u00b0C) is diagnostic of CaCl2\u00a0+\u00a0MgCl2 in the fluid. The more saline and CaCl2-rich fluids are related to sulfide-free barite mineralization and occur along the fault zone, close to the Mul granite intrusions (along with F2fault systems). The less saline and NaCl-rich fluids, associated with sulfide-bearing (galena) barite mineralization, occur along the cross faults (F3fault systems) of F2. At the later stage, the crystallization of sulfides by mixing with seawater at a temperature regime of 156 to 217\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in reduced fluid salinity in the system (mostly\u00a0<5\u00a0wt% NaCl eq.). A decrease in temperature during water-rock interaction induced changes in ore fluids composition that led to precipitation of quartz\u2013barite veins along pre-existing structural weak planes, i.e., F2 and F3. This situation is more akin to many fluorites\u2013barite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sulfides hydrothermal deposits of the world formed along the fault at the interface of the basement\u2013cover sediment (Roedder 1984; Hedenquist and Henley 1985; Staude et al., 2011; Margoum et al., 2015; Walter et al., 2020). The mineralized fluid of low-temperature and low-salinity features (mostly\u00a0<5\u00a0wt% NaCl eq.) occurred in many hydrothermal vein systems of the Palai\u2013Islica epithermal deposit in Spain Carrillo Rosua et al. (2003) and Waihi epithermal deposit in New Zealand (Brathwaite and Faure 2002).\n\n\n4.3\nRole of structure in fluid movement and barite mineralization\nThe Precambrian crust of India has witnessed several rift events and remains episodically active from the Mesoproterozoic or earlier to the present (Chaudhuri et al., 2015; Saha and Chaudhuri, 2003). The oldest sediment in these Indian basins is of Mesoproterozoic or older. The rifting within Neo Archean TTG basements and the PG basin opening were believed to have been initiated during\u00a0\u2013\u00a01.5\u20131.6\u00a0Ga (Saha and Chaudhuri, 2003). The rifting and opening broadly coincide with the extensional events in Eastern Ghat (EG), Bastar Craton and East Antarctica. The Indian craton was separated from East Antarctica by opening the Indo-Antarctic ocean basin (Fig. 13\n). Due to the rifting along N-S tending boundary faults, many sympathetic (F2) and cross fault systems (F3) of the boundary faults developed within the TTG gneisses and charnockites basement rocks in the study area. These deformational structures and associated hydrothermal mineralized veins in the region played a crucial role in fluid systems and their evolution (Fig. 3g\u2013h). Mul granite emplacement (ca 1.6\u00a0Ga) provided requisite heat flow and fluids. The fault structures associated with the extensional rifting of the PG basin provided a pathway for fluid migration. Gradual alteration of Mul granites due to fluid circulation and cooling resulted in Ba, Si, alkalis and Fe's release and their mobilization along the weak planes. The earliest weak planes of fault (F1 and F2) fold structures within the country rocks created enough space to facilitate the migration of mineralized fluids (Figs. 1 and 14\n). The occurrence of hydrothermal mineralized barite veins along F2 faults is indicative of their controlled structural pathways and depositional sites in the study area. Moreover, their magmatic imprints suggest fluid sources from the basement country rocks. Hence the probable deep-seated F2 fault systems provided the requisite fluid pathways.\nThe stratigraphic succession in the PG basin preserves a wide variety of lithofacies associations evidenced by multiple marine transgression and regression events (Saha and Chaudhuri, 2003). The basin was connected to an ocean basin on the eastern side of the Indian craton (Fig. 13). The southeastern part of the basin acted as the pathway for marine transgression (Saha and Chaudhuri, 2003). The PG basin's eastern sequence records evidence of NW-SE trending folds, imbricate thrust faults and related shear zones, and E-W trending strike-slip faults (Ghosh and Saha, 2003). The basin fill characteristics indicate rapid uplift of basin floor along high angle faults, which propagated from the basement to the overlying sedimentary rocks. Series of such fault systems (F3) have been observed in the study area, traversing from the TTG gneissic country rock to the PG rift basin. These connected faults (F3) could be the possible pathway for marine incursions from the PG basin in the study area. The isotope signature of barite veins within F3 faults is indicative of a marine sourced sulfide-bearing fluid.\n\n\n4.4\nOre genesis and economic significance\nThe barite mineralization of central India is undoubtedly fault-related (Dongargarh barite, Sinroncha barite and Gondpipri barites). Though fluid migration timing is poorly constrained, the barite mineralization is broadly confined to Mesoproterozoic ca 1.6\u00a0Ga Mul granite and ca.1.2\u00a0Ga PG sediments. The boundary fault-controlled iron ore mineralization of Gajoli is of hydrothermal vein-type (Rao et al., 2020). Ba-F veins of Dongargaon and Sironcha, hosted in PG valley sediments, show MVT signature Randive et al. (2016), Randive et al. (2021). The Thanewasna-Ghanpur iron oxide-gold-copper (IOCG)\u2013type deposit associated with barite veins are of structurally controlled epithermal origin (Dora et al., 2020).\nHydrothermal alteration caused hydration of the K-feldspar in Mul granite, resulting in leaching of the alkalis, silica, and Ba (Fig. 5b\u2013d). Barium seeped out of the alkali feldspars, as temperatures dropped, liberated into ore fluid. High hydrostatic pressure allowed the ascent of Ba-enriched fluids towards shallow levels along structural conduits (F2 and F3 faults). An incursion of seawater from PG valley led to a supply of SO4\n\u22122, causing barite precipitation along F3 fault systems (Fig. 14). Such a situation is further supported by the sulfur isotope (\u03b434S) and 87Sr\/86Sr isotope evidence. Fluid boiling and mixing also caused a drop in pressure and separation of lower salinity vapors from the Ba-bearing ore fluid. The increase of the Ba+2 contents also decreased barite solubility in the solution and triggered barite precipitation.\nAdditionally, oxidation of Fe+2 to Fe+3 due to interaction of the magmatic fluid with seawater led to the co-precipitation of barite and hematite in the veins. During the fluid mixing process, precipitation of barite veins in the study area dominantly occurred (Fig. 9c). Sulfide-free barite veins form when the reducing agent lacks fluids. Moreover, other prevailing conditions would support high salinity (15\u201330 % NaCl eqv.) under neutral conditions. So that sulfide free barite can form as follows:\n\n\n\nB\n\na\n\n\n\n\naq\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n\nSO\n\n4\n\n\naq\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n=\n\n\nBaSO\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, sulfide-bearing barite probably forms when fluid mixing and reduction coincide. This requires reducing agents like methane to the mixing aqueous fluids (e.g., Walter et al., 2019). The fluid inclusion Raman micro-spectroscopy data from sulfide (galena) bearing barite from the study area show clear evidence of CH4 (Fig. 10), which might have oxidized so that SO4 can reduce into sulfide through the following equation:\n\n\n\nPbC\n\nl\n2\n\n\n\n\naq\n\n\n\n\n+\n\nS\n\nO\n4\n-\n\n\n+\n\nC\n\nH\n4\n\n\n=\n\nP\nb\nS\n\n+\n\n2\nC\n\nl\n-\n\n\n+\n\n\nH\n+\n\n\n+\n\nH\nC\n\nO\n\n-\n-\n3\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nH\n2\n\nO\n\n\n\n\n\nSulfide bearing and sulfide-free barite veins were formed in close spatial and temporal proximity. The structural analyses and Sr-S isotope studies of barite provide a better geological framework, favoring the central India barite as part of the fault-controlled regional submarine hydrothermal vein type. Hydrothermal vein types of sulfide free (magmatic-hydrothermal) and sulfide-bearing barite (submarine hydrothermal) mineralization has been reported elsewhere in the world like Schwarzwald, Germany; Athabasca Basin, Yukon Territory, Canada; Rio Grande Rift, Illinois, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Sardinia (Richard et al., 2016; Walter et al., 2020).\nThe Ba-F mineralization has been mined at Dongargaon about 60\u00a0km NW of the present study along the regional boundary fault (Randive et al. (2021) and references therein) and about 50\u00a0km SE of the Sironcha area. At places, Ba-mineralisation is closely associated with fluorite. Fluorite appears to be a more effective exploration guide for REE-Ba-F mineralization. The presence of fluorite in close association with barite in the study area is prospective for regional exploration for Ba-REE in central India and elsewhere in a similar geological milieu. The identification of Ba in the Gondpipri, PG valley region as hydrothermal vein-type has substantial implications for mineral exploration activities. It boosts regional level explorations for >150\u00a0km strike length all along the northern shoulder of the PG rift valley from SE in Sironcha to NW in Dongargaon (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n5\nConcluding remarks\nBased on structural mapping followed by detailed petrography, mineral chemistry, REE-geochemistry, Sulfur, and Sr isotope geochemistry, as well as fluid inclusion data, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the origin and evolution of vein-type barite mineralization hosted in Mul granite, central India:\n\n1.\nDue to the regional deformation and tectonic activity associated with the Pranhita Godavari rifting, weak planes\/fracture systems opened up (F2 and F3) as pathways for ascending fluids in the host ca.1.62\u00a0Ga Mul granites of Western Bastar Craton. Changes in the fluids\u2019 physicochemical conditions during their ascent along fracture networks played a crucial role in barite mineralization's genesis. The F2 fault system, sympathetic to the PG rift, is deep-seated and contains mainly barites of magmatic origin besides the minor marine signature. The F3 fault system is orthogonal, across the gneissose foliation of the TTG gneisses and charnockites country-rock, and can be traced to PG's younger marine sediments basin. Hence, the barites occurring along F3 faults show influences of both marines as well as magmatic sources.\n\n\n2.\nThe mother brine causing Ba-F-sulfide mineralization at Gondpipri have bimodal evolution, viz., oxidative source forming sulfide-free high-salinity brine and reductive low-salinity sulfide-bearing aqueous fluids formed by interaction with reducing agent, i.e., CH4. The cooling and mixing of magmatic fluids with seawater have resulted in the diversity of mineralization compositions observed in the study area.\n\n\n3.\nThe \u03b434S values of the barites range between\u00a0+10.31 \u2030 and 15.19 \u2030, similar to hydrothermal barites and overlap with barites from evaporites (?), but lower than seawater barites. On the other hand, \u03b434S of galena is contrastingly lower than that of barites, occupying a narrow range between\u00a0+0.18 \u2030 and\u00a0+3.0 \u2030, showing magmatic signature. Such contrasting signatures of \u03b434S in barites and galena indicate distinct source characteristics. The barite veins younger than\u00a0\u223c1.62\u00a0Ga Mul granites were inherited from the epigenetic, shallow-marine, hydrothermal source; whereas, the galena shows inheritance from the magmatic or biotic sulfate reduction source.\n\n\n4.\nThe 87Sr\/86Sr isotopic ratios of the Gondpipri barites display two distinct arrays; one with lower 87Sr\/86Sr of 0.706075 \u2013 0.707791, having lower salinity, suggests the influence of Mesoproterozoic seawater. The second one with higher 87Sr\/86Sr of 0.71561 \u2013 0.719785 and relatively higher salinity indicates mixing hydrothermal solutions with the fluids formed in the continental areas generated in the rift valley. The comparative study of barites from central India and other deposits of India, Greece and Germany shows remarkable similarities regarding their 87Sr\/86Sr isotopic composition.\n\n\n5.\nThe combined S-Sr isotopic systematics show two distinct clusters: (i) magmatic and (ii) mixture of marine\u00a0+\u00a0crustal fluids generated in the rift valley.\n\n\n6.\nBased on the field and integrated laboratory studies, the Central India barite are typically epigenetic-submarine hydrothermal vein-type and differ from the Sedex, VMS, Carlin, or Orogenic type barite deposits. This has a great deal of implications for future exploration targeting.\n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Polish native sulfur stratabound deposits are associated with the Middle Miocene (Badenian) evaporites deposited in southern Poland\u2019s Carpathian Foredeep (CF). They occur in the CF\u2019s marginal zone and constitute a WE-trending sulfur-bearing belt, which extends farther to the SE into Western Ukraine (Fig. 1\n). The native sulfur deposits were thought to have formed because of the epigenetic mole-by-mole replacement of solid calcium sulfate with calcium carbonate and the native sulfur accumulated in the uplifted tectonic blocks under the impermeable overburden of the Upper Badenian\u2013Sarmatian clayey sediments (Bolewski, 1935; Paw\u0142owski, 1959, 1963, 1968, 1970; Krajewski, 1962; Paw\u0142owska, 1962; Osm\u00f3lski, 1963, 1972; Czermi\u0144ski, 1968a; Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski, 1974; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1979, 1985, 1987; Pawlikowski, 1982; Krysiak, 1985, 1987; Nie\u0107, 1986, 1992; Kubica, 1992, 1994, 1997, 2004; Parafiniuk et al., 1994). Hydrocarbons migrating from the folded Carpathian orogenic belt through fault systems were degraded in such structural traps by bacteria which used sulfates (gypsum) and led to the precipitation of secondary limestones and commercial accumulation of native sulfur. Bacterial processes involved in the epigenetic Polish sulfur deposits formation allow define them as bioepigenetic ones (sensu\nRuckmick et al., 1979). In this work, the terms \u201ebioepigenetic\u201c and \u201eepigenetic\u201d are used equivalently.\nIn such a system, the epigenetic reduction of solid gypsum assumes that (i) the intensity of the replacement process decreases with the distance from structural discontinuities and ceases in basinal gypsum formation and (ii) the active fluids, which infiltrate and transform the rock formation, should subsequently change their chemical and physical properties, preserving the replacement products. Consequently, these products should be dispersed equally throughout the epigenetically altered rock formation. However, the distribution of native sulfur in the Polish deposits is highly irregular. Moreover, the zones of economic-grade sulfur-bearing limestones are accompanied by zones of barren limestones commonly devoid of or contain only traces of native sulfur distributed locally close to the orebodies. Hence, the commonly observed lithological zoning is incompatible with the epigenetic formation model of the Polish native sulfur deposits, and their origin remains enigmatic. Although Davis and Kirkland (1979) noticed that the isotopic composition of biosyngenetic and bioepigenetic sulfur deposits are similar and cannot be differentiated in this way, one may expect that the pervasive, closed fluid migration pattern extending from fractured zones toward the gypsum basin should produce regional oxygen and carbon isotope distribution patterns because differences between original host rocks and mineralizing fluids should generate isotopic gradients during fluid\u2013rock interactions. Thus, an examination of areal distribution patterns of stable oxygen and carbon isotopes, referring to sedimentological features of the Osiek\u2013Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski (O\u2013BS) native sulfur deposit (Fig. 1), may provide important paleoenvironmental data, contributing to the origin of the lithological zoning in the barren and sulfur-bearing limestones. Generally, the areal isotope distribution patterns associated with the native sulfur ores are also vital for verifying the model of massive diagenetic alteration of solid calcium sulfates into calcium carbonates and native sulfur.\nThe results of this study may have genetic consequences for other stratabound native sulfur deposits around the world that exhibit comparable zoning, such as those in Western Ukraine which belong to the same Badenian evaporite basin (e.g. Aleksenko, 1967; Ivanov, 1968; Merlicz and Dacenko, 1976). The barren limestones are present also in sulfureous areas associated with evaporites of the Messinian of Sicily (e.g. McKenzie, 1985; Decima et al., 1988), the Middle Miocene of Mishraq orebody (northern Iraq) (Nie\u0107, 1982), and the Upper Permian Delaware Basin (e.g. Zimmerman and Thomas, 1969; Davis and Kirkland, 1970). This study implies that the lithological zoning pattern recorded in the Polish sulfur ore regions is also associated with other stratiform sulfur deposits in the world. This points to palaeogeographic (syngenetic) conditioning of such elemental sulfur deposits formation as is suggested by this paper.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nCores derived from 58 boreholes drilled within the O\u2013BS native sulfur deposit and its vicinity were sampled for polished and thin sections. The sedimentary structures and mineral textures of the limestones were described, and a facies analysis was conducted. Furthermore, 975 calcite samples were collected from 49 boreholes for stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses (Table 1\n). Sparry calcite cement recognized under the binocular was omitted during microdrilling; however, some supplementary samples of calcite cement were taken from the same samples for comparative studies. Thin sections were prepared and examined under the microscope in cases when the mineralogy of certain samples was uncertain. Carbonate samples were powdered, and the powders were treated with 100\u00a0% phosphoric acid at 70\u00a0\u00b0C using a Gasbench II equipment connected to a ThermoFisher Delta V Plus mass spectrometer. Reproducibility for \u03b413C and \u03b418O was\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, respectively. According to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard (VPDB) and Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB), all values were presented per mil. These samples were reacted under vacuum with 100\u00a0% phosphoric acid at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The isotopic composition of the generated CO2 gas was analyzed using a VG Micromass 903 triple-collector mass spectrometer, applying the appropriate correction factor. For precision measurements, the standard deviation of the mean calculated for replicate analysis was\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0\u2030 and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0\u2030 for \u03b418O and \u03b413C, respectively. The coefficient of variation V was calculated according to the formula V = (\u03c3\/\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0%, where \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0standard deviation and \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u00a0=\u00a0arithmetic mean. Most of the samples (839) were analyzed at GeoZentrum Nordbayern in N\u00fcrnberg, Germany, while the rest (136) were analyzed at the Geological Institute of the E.T.H., Zurich, Switzerland.\nThe results of stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses were calculated for a percentage of the whole set of results indicating methane-derived carbonates (assumed values\u00a0<\u00a0\u201330\u00a0\u2030 VPDB), bacterial sulfate reduction-derived carbonates (assumed values \u201330\u00a0\u2030 to \u20134 \u2030 VPDB), seawater brine influence (assumed values 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0\u2030 VPDB) in the case of \u03b413C values and influences of meteoric waters (assumed values \u201314\u00a0\u2030 to \u20134 \u2030 VPDB), marine brine waters (assumed values 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u2030 VPDB) in case of \u03b418O values in barren limestone zone, sulfur-bearing limestone zone, and gypsum zone.\nThe Chemical Series stratigraphic unit\u2019s isopach map and the \u03b418O and \u03b413C value maps were constructed with the ArcGIS Desktop ver. 10.7.1 software using the kriging method. The isotope distribution maps were constructed using the mean \u03b418O and \u03b413C values calculated for particular boreholes. The boreholes for isotope analysis were selected from the barren limestone zone, sulfur-bearing limestone zone, and gypsum zone in a grid density changing from several hundred meters to\u00a0\u223c\u00a04\u00a0km (usually up to\u00a0\u223c\u00a01\u00a0km from each other). The boreholes located in different tectonic blocks outside the Suchowola and Strzegom Faults were excluded from the analysis. The mean values of \u03b418O and \u03b413C in individual boreholes were calculated based on isotope analyses conducted in samples spaced in borehole profiles at distances mostly of 0.5\u20131\u00a0m. In the case of slight lithological variability in the sediments, isotope analysis results were obtained from samples spaced at 1.5\u20133\u00a0m.\n\n\n3\nGeological setting\n\n3.1\nMiocene of the northern Carpathian Foredeep\nThe Polish part of the northern CF is largely made up of Miocene (Lower Badenian\u2013Lower Sarmatian) sediments deposited onto various Precambrian, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic strata (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1979; Kubica, 1992; Karnkowski, 1994; Paw\u0142owska, 1994). The clastic\u2013carbonate Baran\u00f3w Beds deposits are the oldest Miocene sediments with a thickness of about 150\u00a0m (Kubica, 1992, 2004) (Fig. 2\n). A discontinuous up to\u00a0\u223c\u00a060 m thick evaporite horizon covers these deposits (Chemical Series sensu\nPaw\u0142owski et al., 1985), which hosts numerous native sulfur deposits (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1965, 1979, 1987). The Chemical Series comprises sulfates (mostly gypsums with insignificant admixture of anhydrites) with locally developed sulfur-bearing and barren limestones accompanied by subordinate clastic and sulfate interbeds. The monotonous Upper Badenian\u2013Lower Sarmatian clastic sediments, which is up to 500 m thick, is dominated by marls, claystones, and mudstones and is covered by Quaternary sediments further up the sequence (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1985; Kubica, 1992; Czapowski and G\u0105siewicz, 2015). For details on the stratigraphy and tectonics of the CF, see Oszczypko and Oszczypko-Clowes (2012).\n\n\n3.2\nMajor features of the Osiek\u2013Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski native sulfur deposit\nThe O\u2013BS deposit is about 18 km long and approximately 2 km wide. It is located within an elongated and uplifted Stasz\u00f3w\u2013Osiek-Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski tectonic block terminated from the SW by the Strzegom Fault (Fig. 3\n). The deposit occurs at depths from\u00a0\u223c\u00a0100\u00a0m (NW part of the O\u2013BS) to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0260\u00a0m (SE part of the O\u2013BS) (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1976, 1987; Kubica, 1992). Its thickness varies from several to about 46\u00a0m, and the average grade of sulfur ore is 29\u00a0wt% sulfur (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1976). The O\u2013BS deposit is bounded from both the SW and SE by a zone of barren limestones ranging in thickness from 6 to 47\u00a0m, and it adjoins a gypsum deposits from both the NW and NE (Fig. 3A). Limestones dominate the lithology of the ore area with additional marls, clays, and gypsum. The facies of both limestone zones (barren and sulfur-bearing) consist of the following associations: limestone (mudstone, floatstone, rudstone, gypsum-ghost limestones, stromatolitic limestones, and calcrete), clastic (marls, siltstones, and vertisols) and sulfate (majorly gypsum) (Olchowy, 2015).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nThe Polish native sulfur deposits reveal the following typical lithological zonation:\nbarren limestone zone\u00a0\u2192\u00a0sulfur-bearing limestone zone\u00a0\u2192\u00a0gypsum zone.\nThe gypsum zone surrounds both the limestone zones (Kubica, 1992, 1994, 1997; G\u0105siewicz, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015). The sulfur contents quickly decrease along the transition from the sulfur-bearing to the barren limestone and the gypsum zones. The main difference between the barren and sulfur-bearing limestones is the presence of native sulfur (Fig. 4\n). Barren zones usually occur on the W, S, and SW sides of the sulfur deposit and may be more marly (e.g. the Tarnobrzeg deposit) or calcareous (e.g. the O\u2013BS and Grzyb\u00f3w deposits) than sulfur-bearing zones. The contacts between the sulfur-bearing and barren limestones or gypsum deposits are irregular and sinusoidal.\nThe thickness of the Chemical Series comprising the O\u2013BS deposit and surrounding areas is variable but more regular in the barren zone than in the sulfur-bearing one (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the thickness of the limestones decreases gradually to the SW, transversely to the extension of the deposit, but increases irregularly along its extension toward the SE. The average thickness of the Chemical Series is 18\u00a0m, 31.5\u00a0m, and 37.7\u00a0m in the barren, sulfur-bearing, and gypsum zones, respectively. The thickness difference between the sulfur-bearing and barren zones is more distinct only in central and SE parts than in NW part of the O-BS ore area. In the sulfur-bearing zone, the lowest thicknesses (<15\u00a0m) are observed in the NW part of the deposit, whereas the highest ones (up to\u00a0\u223c\u00a050\u00a0m) occur in its central part, close to the boundary of the gypsum zone.\nThe barren limestones are also found in the sulfur-bearing and gypsum zones, where their thickness varies, are subordinate, and occur in various lithostratigraphic positions. There are no mutual correlations between the barren limestones of the sulfur-bearing zone and those of the gypsum zone. In the sulfur-bearing zone, gypsum interbeds are more common and thicker than those in the barren zone. Moreover, in the sulfur-bearing zone, facies are relatively more diverse than in the barren zone and comprise, thin vertisols, calcrete horizons, and stromatolitic limestones, which are absent from the barren zone (Olchowy, 2015) (Fig. 5\n). In the sulfur-bearing zone, erosional washouts are also accompanied by limestone clasts. In clayey mudstones from the sulfur-bearing zone, quartz grains, root traces, ferruginous spots, and coalified plant fragments are frequently observed. The clayey mudstones, rudstones, and gypsum-ghost limestones (sensu\nG\u0105siewicz, 2000a, b) facies are characteristic for the barren zone and the sulfur-bearing one. The barren zone facies are commonly laminated with calcite and clay matter.\nA sedimentological study of the O\u2013BS deposit area revealed a range of lithofacies and sedimentary structures in both the limestone zones. The facies composition of barren and sulfur-bearing zones is dominated by floatstone, rudstone, and mudstone (Olchowy, 2015). Floatstones and rudstones display similar sedimentary structures which include common angular limestone and gypsum intraclasts oriented chaotically or showing normal grading or locally repeated in short sections. Barren limestone intraclasts co-occur with clasts containing sulfur. The facies contain also erosional surfaces, local irregular clay laminae, rounded sulfur grains, plant detritus, quartz grains, and root traces with ferruginous spots. The only difference between floatstones and rudstones is a higher share of limestone intraclasts embedded within the carbonate-sulfureous matrix. Mudstones contain typically clay and sulfur laminae or are structureless. They display rarely erosional surfaces and single limestone intraclasts. Some of the sedimentary structures of the barren and sulfureous rocks are presented in Figs. 4 and 5.\n\n4.1\nDistribution of oxygen and carbon isotopes\nThe mean \u03b418O and \u03b413C values in calcite samples reveal a highly irregular areal distribution with a few clusters of higher and lower values (Fig. 3B and C). Generally, both the \u03b418O and \u03b413C values decrease to the SE. At the boundary between gypsum and sulfur-bearing zones, increased \u03b418O values are locally observed. The lowest mean \u03b418O and \u03b413C values occur in the central part of the study area, in both the barren and sulfur-bearing zones, whereas the higher mean values are typical of the gypsum zone. Distinctly lower \u03b418O and \u03b413C values occur in the SE part and significantly higher ones are found in the NW part of the limestone zones (Fig. 3B and C). Relatively higher isotope values are present in limestone samples derived from the gypsum zone, where \u03b418O and \u03b413C values increase up to 1.5\u00a0\u2030 and 0.4\u00a0\u2030, respectively (Table 2\n). The isotopic signatures of the barren and sulfur-bearing limestones are generally similar; however, the sulfur-bearing limestones have slightly higher mean values of \u03b418O and \u03b413C (\u22124.8\u00a0\u2030 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a036.0\u00a0\u2030, respectively). In comparison with the barren limestones, \u03b418O and \u03b413C have a mean value of\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.2\u00a0\u2030 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a038.8\u00a0\u2030, respectively. The correlations of the \u03b418O and \u03b413C mean values are strong in the barren zone (r\u00a0=\u00a00.58) and modest in the sulfur-bearing zone (r\u00a0=\u00a00.40). The coefficients of variation for \u03b418O and \u03b413C are moderate and similar in both zones and slightly lower in the barren zone (V\u00a0=\u00a032 and V\u00a0=\u00a028, respectively) than in the sulfur-bearing zone (V\u00a0=\u00a039 and V\u00a0=\u00a040, respectively). The isotopic values of both zones are statistically distinct from the barren limestones found in the gypsum zone. With a similar mean value of \u03b418O (\u22124.7\u00a0\u2030), the mean value of \u03b413C in the gypsum zone is significantly higher (\u221222\u00a0\u2030); \u03b418O and \u03b413C show no correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.07), and their coefficients of variation are strong (V\u00a0=\u00a063 and V\u00a0=\u00a078, respectively).\nIsotope compositions of calcite matrix and calcite cement in the O\u2013BS deposit\u2019s gypsum-ghost limestones varied (Fig. 6\n). A comparison of both the sediment components from the sulfur-bearing zone show lower mean isotopic values than those from the barren zone: \u03b418O (\u223c1.10\u00a0\u2030 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.6\u00a0\u2030, respectively) and \u03b413C (\u223c8.2\u00a0\u2030 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.5\u00a0\u2030, respectively) (Table 3\n). Furthermore, the differences in mean \u03b418O values for the matrix and cement from the barren and sulfur-bearing gypsum-ghost limestones are small. However, the average \u03b413C values in cement are significantly lower than those in the matrix from the sulfur-bearing and barren limestones (14.3\u00a0\u2030 and 6.6\u00a0\u2030, respectively) (Table 3). Moreover, the ranges of \u03b418O and \u03b413C values in both the matrix and cement are higher in sulfureous rocks than in barren limestones (Table 2). While the correlation between \u03b418O and \u03b413C values in the barren zone matrix is positive and high (r\u00a0=\u00a00.74), it is absent in the sulfur-bearing zone (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.08). Calcite cement from both zones has a consistently low negative correlation between \u03b418O and \u03b413C values: r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.20 in the barren zone and r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.38 in the sulfur-bearing one.\nGenerally, this study\u2019s isotopic data comprise hitherto isotopic results on limestone samples from different Polish sulfur ores. However, comparing our stable isotopic dataset to previous ones related to other Polish sulfur deposits is extremely challenging, owing to insufficient isotopic data presentation in older publications. Nevertheless, a summary of the results of these studies is presented (Table 4\n). According to Table 4, previous stable isotopic research was primarily focused on two open-pit mines and was occasionally supplemented by infrequent samples from a few boreholes of the large Tarnobrzeg sulfur deposit and O\u2013BS orebody. None of these isotopic datasets are quantitatively sufficient or larger, i.e., comprising a wider area, thus allowing for regional characteristics and comparisons. Nevertheless, the older stable isotopic values generally fit quite well within the range of our dataset, implying a genetic uniformity in the stable carbon and oxygen isotope composition of the Polish sulfur deposits.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and interpretation\n\n5.1\nLithological and mineral variation versus epigenetic transformations\nAccording to the epigenetic concept, barren limestones from the Polish native sulfur deposits do not differ structurally or texturally from sulfur-bearing limestones except for the presence or absence of sulfur, which proves only the per se mobility of sulfur after ore formation.\nThe Polish sulfur deposits\u2019 outstanding and typical feature is a very high spatial variation of sulfur concentrations within sulfur orebodies. This strong inhomogeneity of sulfur distribution in the sulfur ores is expressed by the accumulation of native sulfur well-above or well-below the theoretical epigenetic mass balance reaction (Kubica, 1965, 1994, 1997; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1965, 1979, 1985, 1987; Paw\u0142owski, 1968, 1970; Nie\u0107 1977a, 1992). The best example of inhomogeneity of sulfur distribution in the O\u2013BS area is a barren limestone zone, containing only traces of native sulfur in boreholes located close to the sulfur-bearing limestone zone. Like other Polish sulfur ores, the O\u2013BS orebody typically exhibits a high variation in native sulfur content horizontally and vertically within the orebody and this variation changes from 0\u00a0% to 42.2\u00a0% (29\u00a0% on average) (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1976, 1987). Apart from the presence of the barren limestone zones associated with the O\u2013BS deposit and the rest of the Polish sulfur ores, the best exemplification of this nonuniform mineral distribution is the common occurrence of barren limestones within sulfur-bearing ore zones. Barren limestones within the orebody are evidently inconsistent with the epigenetic \u201cmole-to-mole\u201d replacement model of the Polish sulfur deposits in a deeply buried, closed system. The differences in native sulfur distribution mentioned above may suggest a large internal redistribution of the main components within the formed sulfur-bearing series and, thus, in the formation of barren limestones.\nThe most prominent of the barren and sulfur-bearing rocks of the Polish sulfur deposits are gypsum-ghost limestone lithofacies. These lithofacies occur locally and comprise less than 10\u00a0% of the Chemical Series thickness in the O\u2013BS deposit (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a, b). Gypsum-ghost limestones are more common in barren limestone zones than sulfur-bearing ones. They comprise more or less abundant structures after selenite gypsum crystals (pseudomorphs) embedded in the micrite matrix. Within these limestones, no partially substituted selenite crystals have been discovered. The pseudomorphs are almost nonexistent in other barren or sulfur-bearing lithofacies, and they can be barren (empty vugs) or partially or completely filled up by calcite or calcite and native sulfur. The detailed characteristics of the gypsum-ghost structures indicate a succession of calcite cements from micritic to peloidal through the rim and radial fibrous to blocky cement precipitated in vugs that remain after selenite gypsum dissolution (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a). Note that inherited sulfate structures are fundamental to the hypothesis that epigenetic replacement proceeds on a molecular scale. However, there are no mechanisms during solid sulfates\u2019 transformation into limestones and sulfur to produce such a sequence of calcite cements.\nAnother salient feature of the Polish sulfur ore rocks that researchers usually omit is their very high lithological and lithofacies spatial variation on very short distances. This is an important feature of the Polish sulfur ores mainly because of possible pathways of internal distribution of the epigenetic fluids and products. The spatial distribution of lithofacies has been investigated in boreholes mainly of the O\u2013BS and Rudniki deposits and at the Mach\u00f3w open-pit mine in the Tarnobrzeg deposit. The lithofacies may change even at a distance of less than 30\u00a0m. The barren limestones, clay layers, and gypsum interbed occur in different stratigraphic positions within sulfureous rocks. In effect, the correlation between detailed lithologies and lithofacies occurring in the barren and sulfur-bearing zones in neighboring boreholes is impossible (D\u017awiga\u0142a, 1965; Stopi\u0144ski, 1975; G\u0105siewicz, 1994a, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015). The epigenetic hypothesis does not explain the observed lithological segregation and lithofacies differentiation and their spatial distributions.\nCompared with other sulfureous or barren rocks, the highest porosity is commonly related to cavernous or vuggy gypsum-ghost lithofacies (G\u0105siewicz, 1994a, 2000a, b). The distinct macroscopic porosity of these limestones would suggest that they could serve as paths for mineral transfer. However, like other barren or sulfureous lithofacies, the gypsum-ghost layers, beds, and lenses are not laterally continuous and spatially correlative (G\u0105siewicz, 1994a, 2000a).\nTaking into account the above considerations, the origin of the barren limestones and especially the barren zone in the Polish sulfur deposit areas appear enigmatic. Two main processes are invoked to explain their formation: karstification (e.g. Paw\u0142owski, 1968; Nie\u0107, 1970, 1977a, b, 1992; Nielubowicz, 1973; Osm\u00f3lski, 1976; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1979, 1985; Kubica, 1992) and hydrogen mobility within epigenetic sulfur orebodies (e.g.Krajewski, 1962; Czermi\u0144ski, 1968a; Paw\u0142owski, 1968; Rybicki, 1973; Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski, 1974; Nie\u0107, 1977a, 1992; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1979, 1985; Kubica, 1992, 1994, 1997; Parafiniuk et al., 1994). Both processes control mass transfer.\n\n5.1.1\nRole of karstification in zonation of sulfur deposits\nProcesses invoked by adherents of epigenetic formation of the Polish sulfur ores could be responsible for the observed larger mass transfer within orebodies and thus the origin of the barren limestones and, in effect, the mineral zonation include impact of surface or subsurface conditions and diagenetic factors. The surface or subsurface conditions are related to karst development within exposed or shallowly buried Chemical Series sediments.\nThe Miocene sedimentary cover of the northern part of the CF, prone to native sulfur deposits, lies unconformably on the platform area composed of the Mesozoic and Paleozoic massifs (Paw\u0142owski, 1965; Karnkowski, 1994; Paw\u0142owska, 1994). This area is located far from intensive tectonic and volcanic activities related to the folding of Carpathian orogen during the Miocene. The regional hydrogeologic pattern of the sulfureous areas in the northern part of the CF suggests a lack of a convection hydrologic system (Turek, 1978). The geological situation of this part of the CF excludes the impact of hypogenic karstification. This conclusion is additionally ruled out by the distribution and values of oxygen isotope results of both the barren and sulfureous limestones and fluid inclusion data (see below).\nIt has been argued that the barren limestones result from infiltration of the freshwater through dislocation zones or via subsurface flow from recharge areas or subaerial exposition before the Upper Badenian transgression leading to karstification of shallow parts of some sulfur deposits. Infiltration of freshwater would cause dissolution and migration of native sulfur and calcium carbonates, thus, causing local enrichment or depletion in these elements within orebodies (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1965; Paw\u0142owski, 1968; Nie\u0107, 1970, 1977a, b; 1986, 1992; Nielubowicz, 1973; Osm\u00f3lski, 1976; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1979, 1985, 1987; Kubica, 1992, 1994). Indeed, relatively stronger karst impacts on the sulfureous rocks have been observed in the shallowest parts of the Tarnobrzeg (especially in the Piaseczno and Mach\u00f3w open-pit mines) and Grzyb\u00f3w sulfur mines (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1965, 1985; Nie\u0107, 1970, 1977a, b, 1986, 1992; Nielubowicz, 1973; Pi\u0105tkowski, 1974; Osm\u00f3lski, 1976). However, this phenomenon is weak or lacking in deeper buried sulfur ores (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1987; Nie\u0107, 1992). Our investigations of the Tarnobrzeg and especially the O\u2013BS and Rudniki sulfur deposits confirm this conclusion. The Chemical Series rocks composed of both limestones and gypsum are covered by a thick cover of the argillaceous succession of the Upper Badenian and Sarmatian, composed mainly (over 90\u00a0%) of clays and marly clays. The O\u2013BS and Rudniki deposits and deeper part of the Tarnobrzeg (Jamnica ore field) orebodies had no significant karstification. Although traces of sulfureous rock erosion are locally evident and generally weak, they may be related more to the Upper Badenian transgression event than to distinct karst processes.\nThe diagenetic factors comprise hydrogen sulfide mobility within sulfur orebodies and the \u201crecrystallization\u201d process of sulfur-bearing limestones. According to researchers, such processes of mineral remobilization and redistribution within a deposit result in the rearrangement of the shape of the deposit and the grade of sulfur ores (Krajewski, 1962; Kubica, 1965, 1992, 1994, 1997; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1965, 1979, 1985, 1987; Czermi\u0144ski, 1968a; Paw\u0142owski, 1968, 1970; Rybicki, 1973; Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski, 1974; Nie\u0107, 1977a, 1986, 1992; Parafiniuk et al., 1994). This process is also often mentioned as the cause of the origin of the barren limestone zone due to the epigenetic removal of solid sulfur. However, the suggested impact of the \u201crecrystallization\u201d of the Polish sulfureous rocks sensu\nNie\u0107 (1977b, 1982, 1986, 1992) remains enigmatic. The so-called recrystallization of sulfur-bearing limestones seems to be realized differently than it is commonly applied in carbonate diagenesis (Fl\u00fcgel, 2010). The term comprises shifts from fine- to coarse-crystalline calcite or crystalline calcite and sulfur. However, as much as the process is illustrated (see examples in Nie\u0107, 1982, 1986, 1992) it displays calcite and sulfur cements developed in vugs of various or unknown origins. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate this process and its impact on mass transfer within sulfur orebodies.\n\n\n5.1.2\nHydrogen sulfide mobility impact on mineral zonation of sulfur deposits\nHydrogen sulfide produced by the anaerobic reaction is highly volatile and can migrate considerable distances before oxidation to various sulfur compounds in sedimentary or rock settings. To explain the evident irregularities in native sulfur distribution within sulfureous rocks, hydrogen sulfide mobility is commonly invoked as the process responsible for the large mass transfer of sulfur species after gypsum reduction, leading to the barren limestone zone formation (Krajewski, 1962; Kubica, 1965, 1992, 1994, 1997; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1965, 1979, 1985, 1987; Czermi\u0144ski, 1968a; Paw\u0142owski, 1968, 1970; Rybicki, 1973; Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski, 1974; Nie\u0107, 1977a, 1982, 1986, 1992; Parafiniuk et al., 1994). Evaluating this internal control on native sulfur distribution within the epigenetic rock framework is worth considering shortly-three attributes of sulfur-bearing bodies, i.e. native sulfur forms or sulfur ore textures and porosity of host rock (both reflecting the potential for crystalline sulfur storage) and hydrochemical stability of deeper ore waters. The first two factors reflect the rock potential for crystalline sulfur storage and the third one marks a possible activity of chemical compounds leading to mobility and then oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and in effect sulfur crystallization.\nMost sulfureous rocks generally represent massive lithologies independent of their lithofacies (Olchowy, 2015), in which sulfur occurs in various forms (Fig. 4). They commonly include sulfur impregnation (disseminated very fine sulfur), various size grains and nodules, dispersed chaotically or aggregated into shorter or longer streaks, laminae, and thin to thicker (usually <5 cm thick) layers enclosed in limestone or marly limestone matrix. Native sulfur as a matrix for limestone breccias occurs locally, and thicker pure sulfur intergrowths up to several tens of centimeters in thickness are rare. However, macropore shapes and their arrangements preserved in the barren limestones commonly do not follow the ore sulfur textures, suggesting their different origins and, consequently, different provenance of the limestones (Fig. 4).\n\nNie\u0107 (1977b) noted that the origin of sulfureous limestone porosity is unclear because it is lower than that expected from the equation of epigenetic transformation of sulfates (by\u00a0\u223c\u00a030\u00a0% - Bolewski, 1935). His view may be supported by the porosity distribution in both the lithological zones of the O\u2013BS deposit. Taking into account the average grade of the sulfur ore as 29\u00a0wt% S (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1976) and the porosity of sulfur-bearing limestones as 11\u201312\u00a0% in both the Tarnobrzeg and Grzyb\u00f3w deposits (Rybicki, 1973; Schlegel, 1975), the removal of sulfur from the barren limestone zone must have resulted in unrealistically high porosity of these limestones, which is not the case (Fig. 4). Although some successions of barren limestones contain relatively numerous but scattered pore spaces, their overall porosity is macroscopically similar to that of sulfur-bearing limestones.\nPore spaces of sulfur-bearing rocks are various in size and shape and change from micro- (pores) to macro- (vugs) and mega-scale (caverns and cavities), and from oval to elongated and irregular. They are often partly or fully (rarely) filled with crystalline sulfur. The crystalline sulfur forms singular crystals or crusts or forms crystalline layers intercalating with limestone layers (sulfur-bedded limestones). This macrocrystalline sulfur is secondary by volume. Sulfur crystals represent sulfur cementation which usually encrusts various other minerals like commonly calcite and rarely celestite or barite as well as macroscopically microcrystalline, friable and structureless amorphous \u201cdusty\u201d accumulates of sulfur. It is possible then that such crystalline sulfur is related to late hydrogen sulfide wandering within the sulfureous framework as gas or dissolved in water and finally responsible for crystallization of elemental sulfur in available spaces. Parageneticaly this type of sulfur is of relatively later diagenetic origin as indicated by the diagenetic history of the gypsum-ghost limestones (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a). It means that sulfur encrustations are closely related to the main phase of sulfur orebody formation and not much later, even today as it is sometimes invoked (e.g. Paw\u0142owska, 1962; Paw\u0142owski, 1968, 1970; Czermi\u0144ski, 1968b).\nIt should be stressed that large sulfur deposits of Poland occur generally in the areas and at the depths which preclude an active exchange of ore waters with Quaternary waters (oxidized). This inference may additionally be supported by the presence of sulfureous limestones which thus proves that sulfur orebodies, after their formation, remain generally stable geochemically in slightly reducing groundwater conditions. This conclusion is especially true for deeper buried sulfur ores, like the O-BS deposit which is sheltered by impermeable thick clayey sedimentary cover. A slow change in ore water hydrochemistry is observed only in the zones of the Tarnobrzeg and Grzyb\u00f3w sulfur deposits adjacent to the infiltration areas, where chemical processes increase hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide contents (Nielubowicz, 1975; Turek, 1978, 1982). Moreover, in the Tarnobrzeg ore area located shallower than the discussed deposit ore, the chemical composition of deeper ore water reflects the exchange of ions for a long period between water and the rocks (Turek, 1978, 1982). The geochemical stability of different sulfur deposits of the CF is also confirmed using the sulfur isotope composition of native sulfur (Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski, 1974).\nIn summary, the impact of hydrogen sulfide mobility on \u201cdiagenetic\u201d elemental sulfur redistributions in a solid rock framework cannot account for the observed significant mass redistribution and thus for the formation of the mineral zonation in sulfur deposit areas.\n\n\n5.1.3\nMass balance\nThe observed remarkable irregularity in mineral distributions within the Polish sulfur ores is incompatible with the assumptions of the epigenetic transformation of solid gypsum rocks into limestones and native sulfur. According to the epigenetic formula, the relationship between calcium and sulfur in gypsum and limestones must be generally constant. However, mass balance calculations indicate substantial deviations in Ca and S and other elemental contents from the theoretical reaction:\nsulfate (gypsum)\u00a0+\u00a0organic matter\u00a0\u2192\u00a0calcium carbonate\u00a0+\u00a0native sulfur and from the elemental composition of natural gypsum rocks (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a, b). The transformation of sulfates into limestone should induce a calcium carbonate\/native sulfur (CaCO3\/S0) ratio equal to 3.12 (Ivanov, 1968). Large variation of CaCO3\/S0 in a range up to\u00a0>\u00a070\u00a0% in gypsum-ghost limestones of the O\u2013BS deposit reflects high irregularities in Ca and S content distribution within the sulfureous zone (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a).\nAs discussed above, additional processes like hydrogen sulfide mobility in the altered gypsum areas or karstification of sulfur ores have a limited impact on substantial mass transfer. Moreover, a transfer of considerable mass within the epigenetic, like in other diagenetic systems, requires large quantities of fluid and effective regional topography-driven fluid flow to ensure the import\/export of the elements from one ore to another (cf. McManus and Hanor, 1993). There is no space for a bulk fluid flow in the closed system and at the molecular transformation front, resulting in significant mineral component redistribution. Instead, mass balance chemistry implies that the system was open to mass transfer and cannot be related to simple and regionally extended replacement of solid sulfate rocks by limestones plus native sulfur.\nThe closed epigenetic system excludes any significant mass transfer (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990). There is no space for the observed irregular substantial mass distribution and redistribution at the molecular front; furthermore, no mechanisms ensure all the lithological lithofacies spatial variation, nonuniform spatial distributions, and native sulfur textures within the originating epigenetic orebody. Sequential calcite cementation like those occurring in the barren and sulfureous rocks is typical for ancient and recent surface diagenetic environments (Longman, 1980; Moore, 2001; Fl\u00fcgel, 2010).\nAs a result of the above review, the epigenetic hypothesis has no merit potential to explain the observed features of areal zonation of the Polish sulfur ores. Closer inspection of the barren and sulfur-bearing limestones indicates more or less distinct mineral and structural incompatibilities between rocks of the lithological zones, which point to different environmental conditions of their formation. The distinct geological features of the Polish sulfur areas, which are inexplicably based on their epigenetic formation, are comprehensible based on their syngenetic sulfur origin (cf. Ivanov, 1968; Merlicz and Dacenko, 1976, partly also Aref, 1998).\n\n\n\n5.2\nInterpretation of oxygen and carbon isotopes distribution\nThe hypothesis of the bioepigenetic origin of the Polish sulfur deposits assumes the transformation of solid sulfates into the barren and sulfureous limestones formed under thick impermeable sedimentary cover in a closed rock system. Such transformation implies a high rock\/water ratio and fairly stable pore water chemistry in a deep subsurface setting of rock alteration. As a result, as in many ancient depositional settings, a relatively linear constant trend in the distribution of isotope values of the final product should be expected (examples in Choquette and James, 1986; Morse and Mackenzie, 1990; Emery and Robinson, 1993). However, in the case of the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit, both oxygen and carbon isotope compositions display several values and nonuniform irregular distribution patterns (Fig. 3B and C). The epigenetic model does not explain such distinctly diverse areal distribution of \u03b418O and \u03b413C values occurring in the O\u2013BS ore region, as presented in Fig. 3B and C. Moreover, such distributions of \u03b418O and \u03b413C values indicate the lack of a much larger differentiation (V) of \u03b413C than \u03b418O values for the Polish sulfur deposits as assumed by Parafiniuk et al. (1994). The isotopic differentiation coefficients of oxygen and carbon are small and similar in both limestone zones compared with the gypsum zone, which is quite high and slightly different from each other (Table 2). As inferred from Fig. 3B and C, the scatter of the oxygen and carbon isotope data points does not indicate any specific fluid flow direction(s) or relationship to the fault zone. The above-mentioned concerns necessitate an explanation of the distribution of oxygen and carbon isotopes and their relationship to some sedimentary aspects presented below.\n\n5.2.1\nOxygen isotopes\nOne of the unresolved challenges of the bioepigenetic hypothesis of Polish sulfur deposits is the source of oxygen for the formation of sulfur-bearing limestones (short reviews in Czermi\u0144ski, 1968a; Osm\u00f3lski, 1972; Nie\u0107, 1982; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1985). As mentioned above, infiltration of groundwater enriched in oxygen is strongly limited to the shallowest parts of some sulfur ores located in the marginal part of the CF. The deeper buried parts of these ores and the ores covered by thick impermeable overburden lack oxygen. In the O\u2013BS deposit area, negative values of \u03b418O dominate, varying in a wide range from\u00a0\u2212\u00a013.2\u00a0\u2030 to 1.5\u00a0\u2030 in all lithological zones (Table 1; Fig. 3B and 7). From the epigenetic viewpoint, the remarkable inhomogeneity of the oxygen isotope composition of limestones from both the barren and sulfur-bearing zones is surprising. This wide range of \u03b418O values suggests the effect of increased temperature on diagenetic solutions during the deeper burial of limestone deposits or a mixed environment of meteoric and marine (saline) water.\nAccording to the history of Miocene sediments\u2019 development after the evaporative horizon deposition, the thickness of the sedimentary cover in the O\u00a0\u2212\u00a0BS sulfur ore did not exceed 100\u2013300\u00a0m (Paw\u0142owski, 1976, 1987). Isotope analysis of samples from the O\u2013BS deposit area showed that the values of \u03b418O\u00a0<\u00a0\u2212\u00a010\u00a0\u2030 are very rare, indicating that the impact of burial diagenetic overprinting as the reason for variations in \u03b418O values may be excluded (Marshall, 1982; Morse and Mackenzie, 1990; Hoefs, 2015). This conclusion can be supported by features of fluid inclusions occurring in the calcite cement of the limestones from barren and sulfur-bearing zones of the O\u2013BS ore. Their morphology and structure, composition (H2O\u2013NaCl\u2013MgCl2), and freezing tests (eutectic temperature, Te approximately\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\u00a0\u00b0C) indicate that the inclusions are primary and formed in a low-temperature environment (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a). These features of fluid inclusions indicate no influence of elevated heat flux or the action of thermal water during calcite cements precipitation.\nThe distribution and wide range of \u03b418O values recorded in the limestones of the ore area is typical for surface open sedimentary system, unlike the close system of the epigenetic transformation of solid sulfates. The oxygen isotope value for primary carbonate in normal marine conditions is approximately close to 0\u00a0\u2030 PDB (Milliman, 1974; Faure, 1998; Moore, 2001). The limestones from the O\u2013BS ore of both barren and the sulfur-bearing zones are dominated by low oxygen isotopic ratios, mostly between \u20138 \u2030 and \u20134 \u2030 (Fig. 7\n), which indicate that these limestones precipitated mainly from the isotopically light meteoric water in a diagenetic phreatic setting (Gross, 1964; Allan and Matthews, 1982; Lohmann, 1988; Saller and Moore, 1991). In the shallow marginal basinal setting, the inflow of the meteoric waters may lead to the complete refreshment of the basinal brine.\nRelatively higher \u03b418O values of the limestones suggest that they may have formed in association with evaporating brines. Infrequent samples with higher oxygen isotope compositions can be related to generally low salinity conditions. The data mixed meteoric\u2013basinal water and thus incomplete dilution of the basinal brines occurring in the limestone domain. There were either local intrusions of marine evaporative brines with oxygen marine isotopic signatures and\/or local evaporation and preservation of small volumes of original brines close to sediment cover surface (cf. Kendall and Harwood, 1996). This may be supported by local gypsum and gypsum-ghost limestone interbeds occurring within the barren and sulfur-bearing zones (G\u0105siewicz, 1994a, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015).\nThe presence of gypsum and gypsum-ghost limestone interbeds in the limestone area of the O-BS sulfur deposit may indicate at least local penesaline water conditions during their formation (e.g. Warren, 2016). Isolated sulfate bodies appear to be associated with local supersaturated waters with respect to gypsum. The gypsum interbeds preserved in the carbonate host rock reflect temporary isolation of the denser saline bottom brine and consequently deposition of some gypsum on the bottom of local niches before deposition of gypsum-free limestones. The gypsum-ghost limestone layers represent the former selenite (coarse-crystalline gypsum) or mixed carbonate-selenite beds which experienced input of meteoric waters leading to the dissolution of the evaporite crystals as indicated by their low \u03b418O values (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015).\nIn such surface conditions, mixing different waters leads to mineral stabilization of primary carbonates. The oxygen isotope compositions of the matrix and cement fractions were determined to recognize diagenetic environments and the extent of diagenetic modifications (Table 3). Little differences in the oxygen isotopic values between the matrix and sparry cement of the limestones of the barren and sulfur-bearing zones (Fig. 6) indicate the calcite precipitation from the same formation waters. Lower \u03b418O values suggest that calcite precipitated mainly from meteoric water and low \u03b413C values that calcite crystalized from the dissolved carbonate phase produced by reactions of organic-matter degradation. The higher isotope composition of both the calcite fractions suggests that they precipitated from slightly different waters. A weak positive correlation between \u03b418O and \u03b413C values for calcite of both matrix and cement (r\u00a0=\u00a00.29 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.32, respectively) implies a mixed meteoric\u2013diluted seawater brine zone (cf. Allan and Matthews, 1982). A slight evolution of diagenetic fluids seems to have been responsible for lower \u03b418O and \u03b413C values in calcite cement compared to the associated micrite matrix.\nIn summary, the distribution of oxygen isotope features of the limestone zones and in the matrix and calcite cement, the features of fluid inclusions in cement, and morphological types of calcite cement (as presented above) exclude deeper burial of the ore and ore-associated rocks and indicate their near-surface environment formation (Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al., 1977; Moore, 2001; Hoefs, 2015). Moreover, the absence of lateral trends in oxygen isotope composition and the similarity between sparry calcite cement and matrix point to the large amounts of water necessary for carbonate precipitation, suggesting that the system was \u201cwater dominated\u201d. Slightly lower mean values and ranges of \u03b418O values of calcite cement than in the matrix of both the limestone zones (Table 3) reflect an open carbonate system and isotopic evolution of the pore water toward slightly depleted isotopic composition because of locally declined water\u2013rock interactions (Lohmann, 1988; Morse and Mackenzie, 1990).\n\n\n5.2.2\nCarbon isotopes\nAccording to the Polish sulfur ores\u2019 epigenetic model, the necessary source of isotopically light organic carbon for their formation was liquid and, as shown in isotopic data, essentially gaseous hydrocarbons, i.e., methane. Because hydrocarbon deposits are not directly associated with the sulfur ores, hydrocarbons are assumed to migrate from folded Carpathian orogen. However, such delivery of hydrocarbons is controversial due to complex lithofacies architecture, the petrophysical properties of clastic deposits of the basement (Baran\u00f3w Beds and its impermeable substrate), and the overburden of the Chemical Series (see discussion in G\u0105siewicz, 2000a).\nIn a closed system, it should be expected that \u03b413C values are aggregated around a relatively stable range of \u03b418O values (Lohmann, 1988). There is no systematic covariance between \u03b413C and \u03b418O values, which could be used as evidence that the carbon-isotope signal is controlled by diagenetic alterations (comp. Glumac and Walker, 1998 with references).\nThe distribution of \u03b413C values in the O\u2013BS sulfur ore area shows several values ranging from about\u00a0\u2212\u00a057\u00a0\u2030 to 5\u00a0\u2030 (Table 2). The higher carbon isotope values were explained by Ha\u0142as (1973) and Parafiniuk et al. (1994) to be a result of oils or bitumens oxidation dispersed in the Miocene deposits. However, these hydrocarbons are lacking in the overburdened rocks and the basement of the sulfur ore areas. Moreover, as Pawlikowski (1982) stated, the trace amounts of hydrocarbons present in gypsum rocks are insufficient to transform gypsum complexes into limy sulfur ore and barren bodies on such a big regional scale.\nThe relatively high \u03b413C values found in limestones of peripheral parts of the Czarkowy native sulfur deposit have been interpreted by Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski (1974) as interfingering of methane oxidation derived (epigenetic) limestones of the central part of the ore and marine-confined (syngenetic) limestones recorded at the margin of the sulfur deposit. Marine provenance of some limestone interbeds in the peripheral part of the sulfur ore, as suggested by Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski (1974), considering the data presented in this study, is only partly correct.\nIn the O\u2013BS deposit area \u03b413C values vary in wide ranges in all lithological zones, extremely from about\u00a0\u2212\u00a057\u00a0\u2030 to 5\u00a0\u2030 (Table 2; Fig. 3C and 7). The differentiated carbon isotope composition of the limestones in all lithological zones of the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit results from the superimposed effect of organic carbon from different sources. The isotopically highest \u03b413C values occur in limestones in all O\u2013BS deposit area lithological zones, whereas the highest differentiation of \u03b413C values occurs in the gypsum zone (Table 2).\nThe high \u03b413C values are comparable with the \u03b413C values of most normal marine carbonates, which vary in the range of 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0\u2030 PDB (Hudson, 1977; Holser, 1979; Emery and Robinson, 1993; Moore, 2001). Comparably, lower (negative) \u03b413C values in the limestones may result from meteoric water with lower \u03b413C values because of the introduction of organic carbon derived from soils and plant material (e.g. Hudson, 1977; Moore, 2001; Retallack, 2001). Calcrete rocks and locally abundant root traces occur in barren and sulfureous limestones of the O\u2013BS sulfur area (Olchowy, 2015) and they may have contributed to the carbon pool of the sulfureous area. These structures and are illustrated in Fig. 5.\nIt is well known that respiration and bacterial oxidation of organic matter liberate organic carbon, which decreases the \u03b413C value of dissolved bicarbonate and finally carbonates. Thus, mixing carbon released from degraded organic matter with HCO3\n\u2212 dissolved in meteoric or marine or saline water may produce an array of isotopic signatures of pore water and precipitated limestones with various carbon isotope values. The main process of organic matter decomposition is bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). The BSR process produces bicarbonate with approximately the same light carbon as in the source carbon, i.e., varying up to about\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\u00a0\u2030 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u2030 and about\u00a0\u2212\u00a025\u00a0\u2030 on average (Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al., 1977; Holser, 1979; Moore, 2001). Limestones of the barren and sulfur-bearing zones with such carbon isotope values are quantitatively secondary (Fig. 7).\nThe limestones of the lithological zones of the O\u2013BS ore area are dominated by very low carbon isotopic ratios aggregated mostly in the range of\u00a0\u2212\u00a050\u00a0\u2030 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\u00a0\u2030, and most samples (\u223c80\u00a0%) have \u03b413C values lower than\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\u00a0\u2030 (Fig. 7). Such a distribution indicates that these limestones were mostly precipitated primarily from the isotopically light organic carbon sourced by methane (Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al., 1977; Pierre, 1988; Clayton, 1992). In the case of Polish sulfur ores, methane is widely thought to be the main carbon source for forming barren and sulfureous limestones.\nThe provenance of methane as the carbon source for the limestone framework considering detailed studies of sulfureous rocks (G\u0105siewicz, 1994a, b; 2000a, b; Olchowy, 2015), partly presented in this study, seems complex (see discussion in G\u0105siewicz, 2000a).\nIn summary, we may conclude that the wide range of \u03b413C values documented in the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit area is incompatible with the epigenetic model assumptions. Instead, the distribution of isotopic values implies that the carbon required to form barren and sulfureous limestones is derived from various sources usually present in sedimentary settings. The distribution of \u03b413C values confirms that the main contributor of carbon was methane.\n\n\n\n5.3\nSedimentary environment of lithological zones\nThe thickness distribution of the Chemical Series indicates it is wedging out to the SW (Fig. 3A). A distinct feature of the stratigraphic unit thickness is its highly variable distribution, especially in the gypsum zone closer to the sulfur ore. The thickness differentiation obviously weakens in the SW direction within the limy zones. The very irregular thickness of the ore area is mainly caused by thicker interbeds of gypsum, which may sporadically comprise a whole column of the Chemical Series. It is worth noting that there is a lack of steep (about 30\u00a0%) reduction of gypsum thickness at the border of the sulfur-bearing and gypsum zones (Fig. 3A), which is implied by the epigenetic model of the gypsum transformation into limestones and sulfur (e.g. Bolewski, 1935; Nie\u0107, 1977a; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1979, 1985). Instead, these patterns suggest that the thickness of the Chemical Series was governed originally by sedimentary conditions, possibly partly controlled by the paleomorphology of the basement. Such environmental conditioning of the sulfur deposit area should be reflected in regional patterns of oxygen and carbon isotope distribution, different from the expected, more or less uniform epigenetic layout discussed above.\n\n5.3.1\nMarginal evaporite environment\nThe regional isotope diversity (Fig. 3B and C) enabled researchers to reconstruct paleogeographic conditions of the evaporite basin, as demonstrated by McKenzie (1985) and Decima et al. (1988). Taking into account a general change in the Chemical Series and both oxygen and carbon isotope distributions in the O\u2013BS area (Fig. 3), it is interpreted here that the limestones precipitated on a carbonate ramp, with a marginal (relatively shallowest) zone of the barren limestones grading into the zone of sulfur-bearing limestones and then into the deeper gypsum zone (Fig. 8\n). This lithological succession is reflected by distinct tendencies to increase the average values of \u03b418O and \u03b413C and the range of \u03b418O, as well as the coefficient of variation of \u03b418O and \u03b413C values from barren to gypsum zones (Table 2). Distinctly lower average \u03b413C and ranges of \u03b418O and \u03b413C values are found in the gypsum zone. The differences mark a general similarity between the barren and sulfur-bearing zone depositional settings and their slight dissimilarity from the gypsum zone limestones. This is also stressed by the lack of correlation between \u03b418O and \u03b413C values and by the distinctly higher variation coefficient in the limestones of the gypsum zone (Table 2).\nThe gypsum precipitation depth delineates a lower limit of the formation of barren and sulfureous carbonate bodies. The depth of the Badenian synformational gypsum selenite beds deposition in the marginal part of the CF has been established as less than 5\u00a0m (B\u0105bel, 2004, 2007 with references). Single gypsum molds, mud cracks, thin soil horizons, plant detritus, quartz grains, root traces, synsedimentary breccias, clay laminae, ferruginous spots, erosional surfaces and stromatolites suggest generally a very shallow, coastal settings exposed to freshwater, developed at the boundary widespread evaporite (gypsum) basin (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015). The high local facies variability in both the barren and the sulfur-bearing zones, with commonly observed floatstones, rudstones, and mudstones with sedimentary structures as described above, suggest deposition in a very shallow environment of mudflat (sensu\nHardie et al., 1978; Warren, 1989; Kendall, 1992) located in front of a relatively deeper gypsum sedimentary basin.\nThe very shallow sedimentary setting is in accord with large areal variations of \u03b418O and \u03b413C distributions, showing the isotopic composition of fluids circulating during the formation of bulk limestones of both the barren and sulfur-bearing zones. Moderate positive correlations between \u03b418O and \u03b413C values in the barren and sulfur-bearing limestone zones of the O\u2013BS deposit (Table 2) can be efficiently explained by the well-understood shallow environments and open diagenetic systems (Marshall, 1992; Moore, 2001; Melim et al., 2002; Hoefs, 2015).\nThe investigated area shows no lateral trends and nonuniform, inhomogeneous layouts of oxygen and carbon isotope values, which are expressed by local areas of lower and higher isotopic values (Fig. 3B and C). Such patterns imply that the isotope distribution was controlled only on a local scale. This is compatible with the inferred very shallow environmental setting and may be explained by local factors, i.e., bottom morphology, which controls the isotope composition of the sedimentary milieu.\nIn a general context, \u03b418O and \u03b413C distributions reflect changes in brine chemistry during the lithological zones formation in the marginal part of the evaporite basin. Significant variations of \u03b418O values (Table 2, Fig. 7) within the limestone zones suggest water composition changes in the sedimentary environment from the freshwater to the diluted seawater brine or to the saline water of the evaporated basin. The predomination of low \u03b418O values (mostly between\u00a0\u2212\u00a08\u00a0\u2030 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a04\u00a0\u2030) in both the limestone zones (Fig. 7) indicates that these carbonates precipitated from the isotopically light meteoric water. A low oxygen isotope composition is a characteristic of freshwater, which could be derived from precipitation or groundwater lenses. An influx of freshwater could flow from the SW from a supposedly small narrow elongated and exposed strip related to the axis of pre-Miocene basement elevation and from the northern part of the SE fragment of the investigated area, where the Chemical Series is lacking (Paw\u0142owski et al., 1976). They represented elevated islands surrounded by a widespread evaporite (sulfate) basin, which may be inferred from regional reconstructions of the Chemical Series distribution in the northern part of the CF (Kubica, 1992, 1994; Kasprzyk, 2008). Such a paleomorphological situation enabled meteoric water delivery to form shallow carbonate ramps by rainfall and surging fresh groundwater lenses driven by topography like most Holocene small islands waters (Budd and Vacher, 1991; Moore, 2001) keeping the coastal waters generally below gypsum saturation levels.\nThe barren limestone zone differs slightly from the sulfur-bearing zone and distinctly from the gypsum zone regarding the oxygen isotope composition. It is characterized by the relatively high positive correlation between oxygen and carbon isotope values (r\u00a0=\u00a00.58), especially in the matrix (r\u00a0=\u00a00.74) of the barren zone and narrower \u03b418O value changes (Table 1, Fig. 7). Compared with other lithological zones, these features reflect a more stable isotopically sedimentary setting with limited influence of basinal water (cf. Li and Ku, 1997). Such interpretation may be supported by relatively sparse and thinner gypsum and gypsum-ghost limestone lenses irregularly and occasionally embedded within the barren zone.\nThe gypsum lenses and interbeds also occur more frequently in the sulfur-bearing limestone zone. They exhibit varied extents and thicknesses and are interpreted as an effect of local intrusions of saline water and\/or locally increased evaporation in more isolated very shallow areas (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015).\nThe tendency of sulfur-bearing zone limestones to have a wider range, lower average, and higher coefficient of variation of \u03b418O and \u03b413C values than barren zone limestones suggests that diluted seawater brine to hypersaline conditions occurred locally and more frequently in the ore zone. These environmental conditions are expressed in the limestones by locally increased oxygen isotopic signatures (Fig. 3B and 7). Additionally, they are supported by gypsum and gypsum-ghost limestone interbeds and lenses. These features argue for mixed, meteoric-basinal water. Comparatively greater changes in the isotope composition of water are found in the gypsum zone. This is reflected by higher average \u03b418O values and distinctly lower average \u03b413C values. The shift toward higher isotope values is accompanied by a relatively wide range of \u03b418O values and a highly uneven distribution of \u03b413C values. Both features are reflected by relatively the highest coefficients of variation and lack of correlation of oxygen and carbon isotopes (Table 2, Fig. 7). Compared with the limestone zones\u2019 environment, these features mark different sedimentary settings of water with mixed isotopic composition, where freshwater influxes intermittently invaded basinal seawater brines.\n\n\n5.3.2\nIsotopic constraints of lithological zonation\nAs discussed in the preceding sections of this study, the epigenetic model of solid sulfate transformation into limestones and native sulfur does not explain the geological structure of the Polish sulfur ores, notably their zonal differentiation. Based on several isotope values results and the epigenetic ground, isotopic zonation of the sulfur deposits has been proposed. Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski (1974) and Parafiniuk et al. (1994) postulated the subdivision of the Polish native sulfur deposits into the central part characterized by\u00a0<\u00a0\u2212\u00a040\u00a0\u2030 \u03b413C and the peripheral part with\u00a0>\u00a0\u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u2030 \u03b413C values.\nHowever, high \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of the O\u2013BS ore area occur in all lithological zones (Table 2), and the isotope mean values display highly irregular areal distribution, with no lateral tendencies in carbon and oxygen isotope compositions (Fig. 3B and C). Thus, rather than the expected isotope regularity, we observe local larger or smaller, more or less expressed areas of higher and lower \u03b418O and \u03b413C values (Fig. 3B and C). They are not correlated with changes in the Chemical Series thickness (Fig. 3). Such a pattern of distribution of isotope does not confirm the inferred isotopic zonation of the Polish sulfur ores.\nThe lithological zonation into carbonate barren and sulfur-bearing zones is related to the zonal presence or absence of native sulfur that marks out wide barren and narrow sulfureous zones and is typical for the Polish stratabound native sulfur ores. In the case of the O\u2013BS deposit, they are extended in the NW\u2013SE direction, generally parallel to each other, and both are surrounded by a widespread gypsum zone (Fig. 3). The areal distribution of both limestone zones is differentiated. The barren zone area is larger and widens toward the SE direction, while the sulfur-bearing zone is narrow and shorter. The barren and sulfureous zones show an increasing thickness from the NW to the SE (Fig. 3A). Moreover, only minor differences in the distribution of average and ranges of the isotopic values between the zones and more distinct variances in the isotope distributions are visible between the limestone and gypsum zones (Table 2, Fig. 7). An important fact is that the average isotopic values of oxygen and carbon distribution are highly irregular and independent of the location relative to the deposit (Fig. 3B and C). All these features suggest that environments of the barren and sulfur-bearing zone formation are coupled facially and similar to one another; however, they distinctly differ with regard to the accumulation of native sulfur.\nThe lithological zones are associated with supposed land areas (islands) (Fig. 3). They represent shallow and extremely shallow successive sedimentary settings slowly deepening toward widespread shallow gypsum basins, generally from SW to NE, across the ore elongation. The paleogeographic situation impacts these environments\u2019 chemical\/isotopic and biological features. In this shallow depositional system, a significant exchange has occurred for solute and gas contained in the sediments with the overlying basinal waters. As considered earlier in this study, the barren limestone zone is not due to the secondary removal of the sulfur mineral. The barren and sulfur-bearing zones represent the original subsettings of the larger carbonate domain. The presence of subsettings is supported by only small facies differences between the limestones of the barren and sulfur-bearing zones (Olchowy, 2015). Moreover, the lithological zonation is poorly reflected in areal oxygen and carbon isotope distributions (Fig. 3B and C). This may be an effect of the too-small number of isotopically measured boreholes or their irregular distribution. Nevertheless, statistical differences in the distribution of the isotope compositions between the zones are noticeable.\nThe nonuniform oxygen isotope composition in the lithological zones indicates that the source of oxygen was not the same throughout the limestone bodies (Table 2, Fig. 7). Apart from evaporation the control of salinity responsible for gypsum precipitation is essentially related to a proportion of fresh and saline waters. In the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit area, where coastal and very shallow settings developed in structural highs of the marginal part of the CF evaporitic basin input of meteoric water could readily dominate the local palaeohydrological budget. Consequently, the barren and sulfur limestone zones of the deposit area are dominated by the influence of meteoric water (92.8\u00a0% and 93.4\u00a0%, respectively). The contribution of limestones with oxygen isotope signatures indicating the influence of diluted brines, with an isotopic composition similar to marine water (the assumed values are 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u2030 PDB) is low and similar in the barren and sulfur limestone zones (7.2\u00a0% and 6.6\u00a0%, respectively). In this context, the nearby gypsum zone differs from the limestone zones and is characterized by a greater (though generally low) influence of basinal brines (16.8\u00a0%) and still the high impact of meteoric water (83.8\u00a0%).\nThe inhomogeneity in the carbon isotope composition in the barren and sulfureous zones indicates that the carbon source was not the same throughout the limestone body and varied significantly. As may be inferred from hitherto data the carbon in the limestones being studied is of organic (mainly) and inorganic origin due to a combination of biological and chemical factors (e.g. Ivanov, 1968; Czermi\u0144ski and Osm\u00f3lski, 1974; Pawlikowski and Przyby\u0142owicz, 1979; Parafiniuk et al., 1994; G\u0105siewicz, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015). Dissolved HCO3\n\u2212 is a carbon source for the formed CaCO3 mineral phases in sedimentary environments (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990 with references). As meteoric water constitutes a negligible carbon reservoir, it is assumed that changes in the value of \u03b413C are barely affected by diagenetic processes. Wide ranges of carbon isotope values are similar (Table 2), indicating the participation of different organic carbon sources in the formation of their limestones in all lithological zones and this is common in evaporating brines (Stiller et al., 1985; Glumac and Walker, 1998).\nModern marine hypersaline brines have wide variations in carbon-isotope compositions caused by evaporation, precipitation of calcium carbonate, organic-matter decomposition, atmospheric carbon dioxide diffusion, and biogenic effects of microbial activity (e.g. Glumac and Walker, 1998 with references). The collected isotopic data indicate that their small part displays carbon isotopic values similar to normal marine carbonates. However, the 13C enrichment in the limestone zones cannot be related to intensive evaporation as the primary cause because is not paired with enrichment in 18O \u2013 coefficient of correlation between \u03b413C and \u03b418O values is weak to moderate (Table 1). These limestones must probably be the result of basinal brine dilution by meteoric water inflow. The share of carbonates with such isotopic features is variable and depends on lithological zones. Within the range corresponding to the brine-diluted influence on the precipitation of CaCO3, it is only 1.5\u00a0% in the barren limestone zone and slightly more in the sulfur-bearing and gypsum zones, which is 6.4\u00a0% and 8.4\u00a0%, respectively. This distribution shows that the seawater brine impact on the limestone precipitation was insignificant, similar to that in the gypsum zones, and negligible in the barren zone, and the slight influence of the basin water additionally decreased toward the land. This is consistent with the observed reduction in the frequency and thickness of gypsum and gypsum-ghost limestones interbeds (G\u0105siewicz, 2000a; Olchowy, 2015).\nThe decomposition of organic matter by bacterial processes, in particular by BSR, is associated with the precipitation of calcium carbonate with \u03b413C values higher than of approximately\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\u00a0\u2030 (Dessau et al., 1962; Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al., 1977; Holser, 1979; Decima et al., 1988; Moore, 2001). The portion of limestones with such carbon isotopic signatures in the lithological zones is variable and similar in the barren and sulfur-bearing zones (15.3\u00a0% and 16.3\u00a0%, respectively) and abruptly significant in the gypsum zone (59.0\u00a0%). Such isotopic distribution of carbon shows that in both limestone zones the intensity of the BSR process was generally the same and relatively low compared with the high intensity in the gypsum zone.\nAs it results from the distribution of \u03b413C values (Table 2), the main source of carbon for limestones occurring in all lithological zones of the O\u2013BS deposit area was methane. The effect of bacterial oxidation of methane in the aqueous medium is HCO3\n\u2212 with low values of \u03b413C, similar to the primary CH4, which is incorporated into the formed calcium carbonate (Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al., 1977; Moore, 2001; Ehrlich and Newman, 2009). In the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit area, the portion of limestones with methane carbon in lithological zones is variable. It dominates in both limestone zones: 84.7\u00a0% and 83.7\u00a0% in barren and sulfur-bearing zones, respectively. The proportion of limestones containing methane carbon is significantly lower in the gypsum zone at 41.0\u00a0%. Considering the lithological zoning, there is a clear difference in the intensity of carbon released from methane or reduced access of methane in the gypsum zone.\nIn summary, the \u03b418O distribution indicates that the barren and sulfur zones are isotopically similar in that they are characterized by a very low influence of basinal brines (\u03b418O 7.2\u00a0% and 6.6\u00a0%, respectively) and the dominance of meteoric water (\u03b418O 92.8\u00a0% and 93.4\u00a0%, respectively). The \u03b413C results also suggest very low seawater brine influence in the barren and sulfur-bearing zones (1.5\u00a0% and 6.4\u00a0%, respectively) and the dominance of methane\u2013derived carbonates (84.7\u00a0% and 83.7\u00a0%, respectively). Both the limestone zones display similar but low portion of BSR-derived limestones, in the range of \u03b413C from \u201330\u00a0\u2030 to \u20134 \u2030 (15.3\u00a0% and 16.3\u00a0%, respectively).\nThe features of these zones differ from the gypsum zone, which is characterized by a small portion of basinal brine (16.8\u00a0%), strong portion (but smaller) of meteoric impact (83.2\u00a0%), high portion of BSR (59.0\u00a0%), and quite a large share (41.0\u00a0%) of CH4-derived limestones. The influence of meteoric water in this zone is surprisingly large. Still, the proportion of limestones of seawater brine origin is small compared with the expected ones, and a relatively large proportion of limestones with low carbon isotopic values correspond to the oxidation of methane in the gypsum zone. However, it should be noted that most of the analyzed gypsum zone limestone samples are located in the close vicinity of the deposit. During sedimentation, when the gypsum and limestone facies overlap in the transition zone between the deposit and extensive gypsum area, infiltration and mixing of water from both zones could occur. In this zone, slight local sulfur is also observed, which disappears further from the deposit.\n\n\n\n5.4\nImplication of native sulfur formation\nThe formation of large limestone sulfur-bearing areas within the widespread CF sulfate-dominated region indicates the local intensity of calcium carbonate precipitation. The formation of a limestone framework composed of barren and sulfur-bearing zones in the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit area occurred in a coastal, shallow environment. This coastal water system was controlled by the interaction between the basinal brine and freshwater input. The occurrence of the deposit is independent of the lithofacies strata and the distribution of oxygen and carbon isotopic values and depends on the environmental conditions on the border of the supposed land and evaporative basin.\nThe oxygen isotopic composition shows that the meteoric water dominates both limestone zones with little influence from basinal and saline seawater. Under typical meteoric water conditions, CO2 and Ca ion concentrations are low (Moore, 2001; Cole and Prairie, 2009; B\u0105bel and Schreiber, 2014). In the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit area, sources of carbon and calcium had to come mainly from bacterial processes. The isotopic composition of carbon indicates intense bacterial processes related to the solute sulfates reduction and the dominant oxidation of methane in these zones. The carbon isotope ratios reflect the mixing of the two reservoirs that produce CO2. The intensity of the bacterial processes resulted in an excess of HCO3\n\u2212 formation, which is essential for precipitating calcium carbonate (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990) forming the main lithofacies framework. These processes were also moderate in the gypsum zone, which should be associated with the proximity of the sulfur zone of the analyzed limestone samples.\nA narrow and shorter sulfur-bearing zone (sulfur deposit) occurs between the shallower sedimentary zone of barren limestones and the relatively deeper gypsum zone. In anaerobic coastal environments, sulfate reduction is an important mechanism of the anaerobic mineralization of organic carbon (J\u00f8rgensen, 1983; Skyring, 1987; Ehrlich and Newman, 2009 with references). This open evaporative depositional system provided a continuous influx of dissolved sulfate during the BSR process. The BSR activity develops in anoxic conditions and uses organic carbon and coexisting sulfate to produce hydrogen sulfide. The occurrence of BSR in the sulfur-bearing brine system is confirmed by the isotopic composition of native sulfur (e.g. Parafiniuk et al., 1994 with references; G\u0105siewicz, 2000a). The presence of BSR in the ore area indicates that the sulfureous zone was generally stratified and anoxic waters developed in the lower brine while the upper waters remained diluted by freshwater. In such conditions, native sulfur is produced by a large sulfur cycle that occurs in stratified water bodies and involves the reduction of dissolved sulfate by the anaerobic reaction, followed by the bacterial oxidation of the resultant hydrogen sulfide to native sulfur and water (Ivanov, 1968; Trudinger, 1979; J\u00f8rgensen, 1983; Postgate, 1984; Ehrlich and Newman, 2009).\nThe isotopic results presented above show that although the proportion of limestones formed due to BSR in both zones of the O\u2013BS deposit is very similar and small, the high accumulation of native sulfur in the sulfur-bearing zone limestones proves a very high intensity of this process. High irregularity of the mineral spatial distribution in the sulfureous zone indicates local differentiation of the BSR intensity and possibly active cycling of dissolved sulfur compounds during the ore formation. However, the high BSR activity is not mirrored by the appropriate isotopic composition of the sulfureous limestones of the O\u2013BS sulfur deposit. This may reflect the location of microbiological zones in the area of the calcareous deposition. The presence of the BSR zone in the water column above the sediment containing methane may lead to a lower binding of CO2 formed by the microbial reduction of dissolved sulfate into calcium carbonate. Such environmental conditions enabled the predominant binding of carbon derived from bacterially oxidized methane into the limestone framework.\nA similar proportion of limestones originated due to the BSR in both limestone zones. The general lack of native sulfur in the barren zone could probably be related to environmental conditions, i.e., an incomplete sulfur cycle. Small amounts of native sulfur are found locally close to the sulfur deposit, which is related to the overlapping environmental influences of both limestone zones. As indicated by the isotope characteristics of this zone, low input of the sulfate ions due to the distance from the sulfate basin and the relatively high influences of the oxygenated water strongly limit or locally eliminate the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The relatively shallow, marginal deposition environment favored the release of locally formed hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere. Moreover, small amounts of native sulfur, which eventually precipitated in this zone, could be rapidly removed by bio-oxidation (Ivanov, 1968; Sokolova and Karavaiko, 1968; Ehrlich and Newman, 2009).\nLimestones from the gypsum zone significantly differ isotopically from those from the barren and sulfur-bearing zones (Table 2, Fig. 7). The relatively high contribution of limestones with methane provenance in the gypsum zone proves the penetration of this zone by water with light carbon isotopes from the adjacent sulfur-bearing zone. This is reflected by interfingering sulfureous limestones and gypsum deposits, especially in the transition of gypsum to the sulfur orebody. The relatively high portion of BSR limestones and thus the high intensity of this process in the gypsum zone do not explain its low sulfur content, which occurs essentially nearby the sulfur deposit. Low sulfur content in gypsum may be due to various factors related to ecological conditions influencing structure, biochemical and physiological properties, and microbial consortium activity, operating in an environment with significantly higher oxygen and salt concentrations fluctuations than in the limestone zones and the high rate of gypsum deposition compared to the rate of carbonate precipitation (Schreiber and Hs\u00fc, 1980; Einsele, 2000).\nThe BSR and bacterial sulfur oxidation developed in a methane-dominated sedimentary setting. The unique combination of microbial carbon and sulfur cycles developed in favorable paleogeographic conditions produced a carbonate rock framework for economic sulfur accumulations. These processes caused transformations of marginal marine evaporite environment and left behind distinct geological features.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe Polish native sulfur deposits display a distinct lithological zonation that developed in the marginal part of the widespread evaporite (sulfate) basin. The zonal succession includes the following zones of barren limestones, sulfur-bearing limestones, and adjacent gypsum occurring from land to basin.\nThe regional mapping of oxygen and carbon isotope signatures of the O\u2013BS native sulfur deposit demonstrates high variability in \u03b418O and \u03b413C values, which is not reflected by limestone zoning. Small oxygen and carbon isotope differences between the zones of barren and sulfur-bearing limestones and relatively high differences between both the limestones and gypsum zones are observed.\nThe lithological zonation and isotope distributions are incompatible with the commonly assumed epigenetic transformation of solid sulfates (mainly gypsum) into limestones and native sulfur as a byproduct.\nThe oxygen and carbon isotope signatures and sedimentological data indicate that the origin of the lithological limestone zones, and thus mineral (native sulfur) zonation, is best explained by the development of coeval very shallow freshwater-dominated sedimentary settings in the marginal part of the evaporite hypersaline basin. Meteoric water dominated the limestone environments of the lithological zones locally and was intermittently invaded by an incursion of the evaporitic water throughout their depositional history. The changes in water chemistry are thus thought to be related to the paleogeographic differentiation of the CF basin.\nIntensive bacterial processes related to BSR and hydrogen sulfide oxidation coupled with methane oxidation operating in various combinations in these sedimentary settings caused the observed mineral differentiation and diagenetic characteristics of the lithological zones.\n\n","7":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe red beds, red continental clastic sediments, are mainly composed of conglomerates and sandstones. Many hydrothermal uranium deposits are spatially and temporally related to the red beds of various ages. For example, the granite-type uranium deposits in the Beaverlodge area, Canada, are associated with the Paleoproterozoic red beds of the Martin Lake Group (Barbier, 1974; Chi et al., 2020), whereas the granite-type uranium deposits in the Massif Central, France, are related to the Permian red beds (Beaucaire and Toulhoat, 1987).\nThe South China is an important hydrothermal uranium mineralization province in China, where a great number of granite-type, volcanic-type, and carbonaceous-siliceous-pelitic sedimentary rock hosted U deposits have been discovered (Fig. 1\n). These U deposits are spatially associated with the Cretaceous-Neogene red beds developed in a continental lithosphere extensional environment (Hu et al., 2007). Therefore, the relationship between the red beds and uranium mineralization has been highly discussed (Chen et al., 1983, 1997; Chen, 1985, 1998; Hu et al., 1993; Zhang, 2007). Many studies advocated that the red beds may have provided oxidizing fluids for mineralization (Yu et al., 2019, 2022; Chi et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The meteoric water may have extracted Fe3+, Cl\u2212, and other substances in the red beds and evolved into oxidizing brines, which are able to improve the activity of the uranium in the underlying uranium-rich rocks such as granites, volcanic and basement rocks (Li et al., 2019a; Guo et al., 2020). Therefore, the meteoric water in the red beds played an extremely important role in the ore-forming processes, which participated in the activation, migration, and enrichment of uranium. However, the driving force of the meteoric water infiltrating into the underlying rocks, and the scale of fluid flow is not well understood.\nDue to the prolonged and large-scale mineralization processes, numerical modelling has advantages and has been widely used in the study of the mechanisms of fluid flow related to mineralization (Chi and Xue, 2011). For example, Bethke (1986) demonstrated that regional ground-water flow across the Illinois basin driven by gravity is responsible for the formation of the Mississippi Valley-type deposits of the Upper Mississippi Valley mineral district. Chi et al. (2013) showed that fluid overpressure was not obviously developed in the Athabasca Basin during the entire sedimentary process, and the compaction-driven flow was very slow. The development of the near-hydrostatic regime may promote the circulation of the oxidizing fluid from the shallow to the basal of the basin through thermal convection, which is conducive to the formation of unconformity-type uranium deposits (Li et al., 2016a,b, 2020). Liu et al. (2010, 2012, 2016) established numerical models to simulate the intrusions\u2019 cooling process related to mineralization systems in the Anqing orefield and the numerical modelling results showed that fluids from different sources concentrated on the high dilatancy zone which controlled the formation of ore bodies during the cooling process of the intrusions.\nThe Xiangshan basin, located in the Gan-Hang volcanic belt, hosts the largest volcanic-type uranium deposits in China (Fig. 2\n). In this study, numerical modelling of fluid flow related to the Xiangshan basin was conducted to fully explore the effects of the red beds on fluid flow. Factors include thickness, slope gradient and permeability of the red beds were systematically investigated by testing various scenarios to study the roles of the red beds on fluid flow, and the implication for uranium mineralization in the Xiangshan basin are discussed according to the numerical modelling results.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and uranium deposits\nThe Xiangshan uranium ore field is tectonically located in the Gan-Hang volcanic belt which is the interface of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks (Gilder et al., 1996; Yang, 2013; Qiu et al., 2017) (Fig. 2). This area experienced complex geological processes such as multi-stage tectonic movements and magmatic activities, especially the strong volcanic activities during the Mesozoic period. During the Cretaceous period, the rollback of the subducted paleo-Pacific plate caused the tectonic regime of South China shifting from compression to extension, and the Gan-Hang volcanic belt was characterized by extensive magmatic activities and associated metallogenies (Jiang et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2008; Mao et al., 2011, 2013), which is also a part of the regional extension-related metallogenic province along the eastern Asian continental margin (Mao et al., 2021).\nThe basement of the Xiangshan basin is mainly composed of the Mesoproterozoic metamorphic rocks, which are unconformably overlain by the Cretaceous volcanic rocks, and above the volcanic rocks in the basin are the Cretaceous-Neogene red beds (Fig. 3\n). The metamorphic rocks with medium and low metamorphic degrees are exposed in the north, east and south of the basin, and primarily consist of phyllites and schists (Hu and Zhang, 1998). The volcanic rocks correspond to two cycles of volcanic activities (Wu, 1999). The first cycle was presented as the fissure eruption, forming the rhyodacite and ignimbrite of the Daguding Formation, with the age of 144\u2013137\u00a0Ma (Su et al., 2014). The second cycle was presented as the central eruption, forming the crystal tuff and porphyroclastic lava of the Ehuling Formation, with the age of 135\u2013132\u00a0Ma (Yang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2017). The majority of the volcanic rocks are the porphyroclastic lava of the Erhuling Formation, which occupy most part of the basin (Fig. 3).\nA number of mafic dykes including diabase and lamprophyre, with ages of ca.125\u201385\u00a0Ma, intruded into the volcanic rocks and basement (Jiang et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2020). Late Cretaceous red beds of the Guifeng Gruop outcrop in the northwestern part of the Xiangshan Basin. These red beds mainly comprise purplish-red, brick-red sandstone and conglomerate, which were deposited in an extensional environment (Zhou and Li, 2000).\nThe structures in the basement are mainly characterized by E-W striking faults, as well as NS, NE and NW striking ones, and they are interpreted to be active during the Indosinian period (Chen et al., 2011). The distribution of the volcanic rocks is significantly controlled by the basement structures. The structures in the volcanic rocks are mainly NE- to NNE- striking faults, as well as EW, NE and NW striking ones. The NE- to NNE-trending faults are dominant in the basin, and are believed to be related to the reactivation of Caledonian NE-striking basement faults (Chen et al., 2011). The intersections of NE-, EW-trending faults and the volcanic collapse structures are favorable locations of the uranium deposits (Fu et al., 2019).\nA number of uranium deposits in Xiangshan ore field have been discovered (Fig. 3), including 3 large ones (Zoujiashan, Julong\u2019an and Hengjian) and 7 medium ones (Yunji, Lijialing, Shidong, Hongwei, Gangshangying, Hutian and Shazhou), and the resource amount has exceeded thirty thousand tons with average grade of 0.1\u20130.3\u00a0% U (Hu et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2017). Uranium deposits discovered at present are mainly concentrated in the north and west of the basin (Fig. 1). The host rocks of uranium mineralization are mainly rhyodacite and porphyroclastic lava (e.g., the Zoujiashan deposit) and granite porphyries (e.g., the Shazhou deposit). However, the mineralization can occur in the red beds as well as in the basement rocks (Chen et al., 2012). The mineralization generally occurs as veins which are related to the development of fracture zones associated with major faults (Fig. 4\n).\nMany researchers believed that faults control the distribution of ore deposits (Wei et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). The deposits in the north are associated with the EW- and NE-trending structures (Zhou et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2013). The deposits in the west controlled by SN structures are generally located in the edges of rhomboid fault blocks composed of NE- and NW-trending structures (Shao et al., 2014; Zhong et al., 2015).\nHydrothermal alteration related to uranium mineralization includes pre-ore albitization and illitization, syn-ore fluoritization and hematitization, and post ore silicification and carbonatization (Zhou et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2008; Deng et al., 2022). The uranium ores can be generally classified into hematite-type and fluorite-type. The hematite-type ore is characterized by the red color, whereas the fluorite-type is dark purple and dark grey in color. The uranium minerals are mainly pitchblende, brannerite and coffinite (Wu and Zhou, 2012).\nVarious geochronological studies have been conducted in the Xiangshan Basin and most of ages are obtained from whole-rock U-Pb isotopic dating of uraninite (Chen et al., 1990; Lin, 1990; Fan et al., 2001; Meng and Fan, 2013; Bonnetti et al., 2020). The uranium mineralization can be divided into two stages. The first stage corresponds to the hematite-type uranium mineralization with the age of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0120\u00a0Ma, and the second is the fluorite-type uranium mineralization stage with the formation age of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0100\u00a0Ma (Fan et al., 2003). In addition, younger ages around 66\u201380\u00a0Ma are also obtained (Lin et al., 2006).\nH and O isotopic studies indicate that the ore-forming fluid was predominantly meteoric water in origin (Du and Wang, 1984; Xu 1985). Recently, in-situ Sr-Nd isotopes of apatite associated with U mineralization from the Shazhou deposit indicate that the oxidizing fluid originated from the red-bed basins (Yu et al., 2022). Moreover, the fact that the uranium mineralization ages are broadly contemporaneous with development of the Cretaceous \u2013 Tertiary red beds (110\u201365\u00a0Ma) indicates the red beds may have played critical roles in the formation of uranium deposits in the Xiangshan Basin (Chen et al., 1983; Zhang, 1999; Li et al., 2019a,b).\n\n\n3\nPrinciples, physical models, and initial and boundary conditions of numerical modelling\n\n3.1\nSimulation principles and methods\nThe fluid flow in a sedimentary basin is primarily driven by the hydraulic gradient created by the slope of the water-table configuration, which commonly corresponds to the basin topography. The exact fluid flow pattern within the basin is associated with the fluctuation of the water table and the variation of the permeability (Garven and Freeze, 1984a, b). Therefore, different numerical models were built to study the critical physical factors related to the red beds that affect fluid flow in the Xiangshan Basin. FLAC3D (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) developed by ITASCA (Itasca, 2012) was used in this study, and it is able to simulate fluid flow coupled with deformation and heat transport. In this study, only the flow module was used to simulate topographic-driven fluid flow (i.e., gravity-driven), i.e., without evoking the mechanical module. The fluid transport in FLAC3D is described by Darcy\u2019s law. More details can be found in the manual of FLAC3D (Itasca, 2012) as well as Liu et al. (2014).\nThis code adopts the explicit finite difference method, which takes the node as the calculation object. The force, mass and pore pressures are concentrated on the nodes, and then solved in the time domain by the partial differential equations. The geometric model of the geologic materials is composed of polyhedral elements within the three-dimensional grids. The physical model is generally regarded as an isotropic porous medium with saturated water. Three variables are contained in describing the fluid flow in the porous media, which are the pore pressure, saturation and specific discharge vector. The correlations of these variables are through many equations such as the fluid mass-balance equation, Darcy\u2019s law and a constitutive equation (Itasca, 2012). The constitutive laws and governing equations have been summarized in many previous studies (e.g., Liu et al., 2014).\n\n\n3.2\nModel construction and parameters\nTwelve conceptual models of the Xiangshan Basin, divided into a basic model and eleven control models, have been established to describe the fluid flow pattern and its relationship with the red beds during the formation of uranium deposits. The basic model consists of basement, volcanic rocks and red beds from bottom to top (Fig. 5\n), reflecting the basic stratigraphic features of the Xiangshan Basin. Most of the Cretaceous sediments that comprised the redbed basin in this region have since been eroded, and only some occur in the northwest of the Xiangshan Basin (Zhang et al., 2009). However, based on fluid inclusion study and fission track ages of apatite, the thickness of the eroded Cretaceous sediments in Xiangshan area (Zoujiashan) are estimated to be from 320\u00a0m to 1500\u00a0m thick during mineralization (Zhang et al., 2007, 2012; Wang, 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012). In addition, digital topography analysis and fission track ages of apatite indicated that the east and south part of the basin suffered more erosion than the northwestern part of the basin (Chen et al., 2012). Therefore, we assumed that the left side of the model represented the northwest of the basin and the right side represented the southeast of the basin, and assigned a thickness of 1.5\u00a0km to the left side of the red beds and a thickness of 1\u00a0km to the right side of the red beds in the basic model with a height difference of 500\u00a0m. The thickness of the volcanic rocks in the Xiangshan Basin ranges from 2280 to 2320\u00a0m based on the stratigraphic column (Shao, 2007; Qiu, 2009; Guo, 2014; Ma, 2017), and a thickness of 2.2\u00a0km is assigned to the volcanic layer in the models. An arbitrary thickness of 4.2\u00a0km is assigned to the basement.\nEach of the control models only modified one variable relative to the basic model, including the changes of thickness, slope gradient, and permeability of the red beds, as well as adding faults in the volcanic rocks. The details are as follows: (1) in the three models that changed the thickness of the red beds without changing the slope gradient and other conditions, the red beds on the left side are 2.5\u00a0km, 2\u00a0km and 1\u00a0km thick respectively (Fig. 6\n); (2) in the other three models that changed the slope gradient of the red beds without changing the thickness of the left side of the red beds, the height differences between both sides of the red beds were 800\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m and 10\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 7\n); (3) in the two models that only changed the permeability of the red beds, a permeability of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 m2 and a permeability of 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 m2 were assigned to the red beds, respectively; (4) in the two models based on the basic model, one and two vertical faults were added in volcanic rocks respectively (Fig. 8\n), and the other model has a fault extended into the basement (Fig. 9\n). The fault zones used in this study have a width of 100\u00a0m, and are located in the volcanic rocks. The main purpose of this study is to explore the flow characteristics of fluids in the volcanic rocks caused by the red beds, so vertical fault is chosen to avoid ambiguous explanations.\nAll the geological materials were regarded as homogeneous. The physical parameters, including density, permeability and porosity, were listed in Table 1\n. These data are generally empirical which are obtained from previous researches (Chen and Li, 1995; Popov et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2019b). Considering the nature of the red beds, hydrostatic pressure regime was used as the initial condition of the systems by setting a water table parallel to the surface of the model. The water in the models was fully saturated. All boundaries are impermeable to fluid flow except the top boundary. Once equilibrium is reached, the fluid flow pattern and fluid velocity in the model can be invoked for analyzing. It should be noted that the focus of this study is to examine the effects of red beds on fluid flow, and thus the heating source related to deep-seated magma, which may drive the hydrothermal convection, is not considered. Future study is warranted to address how the two driving forces (topography-driven and thermal convection) compete with each other and affect the fluid flow related to uranium mineralization.\n\n\n\n4\nModelling results\n\n4.1\nEffects of thickness of the red beds\nIn this scenario, the thickness of the red beds is changed in each model while the slope is maintained (Fig. 6). The red beds in the first model (Model 1) have the thickness of 1\u00a0km to the left side and 0.5\u00a0km to the right side (Fig.\u00a06a).\nThe pore pressure in the Model 1 is shown in Fig. 10\n. Pore pressure increases with depth, and the maximum pore pressure in the model is 7.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 Pa. The flow pattern of the fluid in each unit is shown in Fig. 11\n, and the fluid flows from the left side to the right side. The fluid velocity is maximized approaching the top of both sides of the red beds with a rate about 1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s (Fig.\u00a011a). The right side of the upper part of the volcanic rocks is the location of the maximum fluid velocity in this layer, with a rate around 5.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s (Fig.\u00a011b). The position of the maximum velocity of fluid flow in the basement is in the top surface of this layer, and the rate is approximately 4.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s (Fig.\u00a011c). The velocities vary by an order of magnitude between the adjacent strata due to the differences in permeability.\nIn the second model (Model 2, Fig. 5), the thickness of the red beds is increased to 1.5\u00a0km to the left side and 1\u00a0km to the right side. Other parameters remain the same as that in the Model 1, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 12\n and Fig. 13\n.The positions where the maximum velocities occurred in the red beds and the basement are similar to that in the Model 1. However, the middle and upper part of the volcanic rocks are the locations of the maximum fluid flow rates in this layer with rate around 4.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s (Fig.\u00a013b). The maximum flow rates are roughly equal to 2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s in the red beds and 3.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the basement, respectively.\nThe red beds in the third model (Model 3) are 500\u00a0m thicker than that in the Model 2 (Fig.\u00a06b). The specific characteristics are clearly demonstrated in Fig. 14\n and Fig. 15\n. Compared Fig. 13 and Fig. 15, the flow patterns of the two models are quite similar. The maximum fluid flow rates were also similar to those in the basic model. The maximum velocities are approach to 2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 3.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the basement, respectively.\nIn the fourth model (Model 4), the thickness of the red beds is 2.5\u00a0km to the left side and 2\u00a0km to the right side (Fig.\u00a06c). Compared with the basic model, there was no distinct change in the results (Figs. 16 and 17\n\n). The maximum fluid flow rates are close to 2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the basement, respectively (Fig. 17).\n\n\n4.2\nEffects of slope of the red beds\nIn the Model 5, the height difference of the red beds between left and right sides is 10\u00a0m, i.e., 1500\u00a0m on the left side and 1490\u00a0m on the right side (Fig.\u00a07a). The modelling results are shown in Fig. 18\n and Fig. 19\n. The fluid flow pattern and the position of the maximum velocities are similar to those in the basic model (Fig. 19). However, the magnitude of the fluid flow rates in this model obviously decreased, which are two orders of magnitude less than those of the basic model. The maximum velocities are about 4.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 7.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 7.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\u00a0m\/s in the basement respectively.\nThe red beds in the Model 6 have a height difference of 200\u00a0m, i.e., 1500\u00a0m thick on the left side and 1300\u00a0m on the right side (Fig.\u00a07b). Compared with the Model 5, the fluid velocity in this model has changed greatly (Figs. 20 and 21\n\n). The maximum fluid flow rates are around 8.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the basement respectively, which are more than one order of magnitude larger than those in the Model 5.\nIn the Model 7, the height difference between the left side and right side of the red beds is 800\u00a0m (1500\u00a0m and 700\u00a0m, respectively) (Fig.\u00a07c). The results are similar to those in the Model 1 (Figs. 22 and 23\n\n). The maximum velocities are roughly 3.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 8.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 6.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the basement, respectively (See Fig. 23).\n\n\n4.3\nEffects of permeability of the red beds\nThe variation of the permeabilities of the red beds were tested. The models have the same geometry as the basic model, but the only difference between these two models is that the intrinsic permeability of the red beds, with 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 m2 (Model 8), and 0.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213 m2 (Model 9), respectively. The maximum fluid velocities in these two models occurred at the same location as that in the basic model. However, there is a big difference between the two models in terms of the maximum velocity. In the Model 8, the maximum flow rates are around 3.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 3.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the basement, respectively. In contrast, in the Model 9, the maximum flow rates are roughly 5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the red beds, 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0m\/s in the volcanic rocks and 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0m\/s in the basement, respectively (Fig. 24\n).\n\n\n4.4\nEffects of faults\nThree models were constructed in this scenario. For Model 10, a vertical fault with a width of 100\u00a0m was inserted into the volcanic rocks (Fig.\u00a08a). In the Model 11, another vertical fault on the left side of the volcanic rock was added on the basis of the Model 10 (Fig.\u00a08b). In the Model 12 (Fig. 9), the fault was extended 1\u00a0km into the basement. The results suggest that the overall fluid flow patterns in these models are almost the same with those in the basic model (Figs. 25 and 26\n\n). However, the flow rates in the fault are higher (more than an order of magnitude) than those in the surrounding rocks due to the relatively higher permeability.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTopographic-driven fluid flow related to red beds\nThe models in this study have been used to explore the effects of red beds on fluid flow in the Xiangshan Basin. The modelling results showed that the fluids in the red beds can circulate into the volcanic rocks as well as the basement, which is highly related to the slope of the red beds. The rates of fluid flow in the volcanic and basement rocks were greatly reduced due to the diminished slope gradient of the red beds. The flow is driven by the fluid potential gradient created by the slope of the water table, which is thought to be a gentle replica of the topography (Garven, 1985).\nWhen other factors remained unchanged, the higher the slope gradient of the red beds, the greater the maximum fluid velocity in the model. It is noticed that the fluid flow rates in the model with the maximum slope gradient (an elevation difference of 800\u00a0m) are about two orders of magnitude higher than that in the model with the minimum slope gradient (an elevation difference of 10\u00a0m). In addition, the results suggest that the thickness and permeability of the red beds exerts little effect on the patterns of fluid flow. The presence of fault in the volcanic rocks dramatically increases the maximum fluid flow rates in the volcanic rocks due to its high permeability, whereas the velocities of the other strata unnoticeably changed. According to the above model results, with the presence of red beds, the fluid flows from high elevation to low elevation along the slope. The recharge was strong in the northwest of the basin, whereas discharge was localized in the southeast of the basin.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for volcanic-type uranium deposits\nIn the sedimentary basins, the topography-driven flow is normally considered to dominant the fluid flow at a regional scale (Freeze and Witherspoon, 1967), which provides favorable conditions for the formation of ore deposits in a relatively short geological period (Garven and Freeze, 1984a, b). In this system, for example, large quantities of fluids could migrate over long distances to favorable locations for mineralization (Bethke and Marshak, 1990; Garven et al., 1993). Hearn et al. (1987) suggested that the regional fluid migration driven by topography resulted in the formation of the MVT deposits in the central and southern Appalachians. The existence of the slope in the basins generally results in a concentrated downward flow into the high permeability unit in the recharge area and a concentrated upward flow out of the unit in the discharge area. It is the gathering of fluid flow that also plays a key role in the mineralization process.\nMoreover, the fluid flow rates necessary for mineralization could also be achieved by a topography-driven flow system. Bethke (1986) showed that the topography-driven flow with moderate fluid velocities is more likely to form the MVT deposits in the Illinois basin, rather than the compaction-driven flows, which moved too slowly to effectively transfer heat during the subsidence of the basin. A numerical model of the fluid flow system in the western Canada sedimentary basin was studied by Garven (1985), which showed that the topography-driven flow system provided suitable fluid velocity, temperature, and metal concentration for the formation of the Pine Point deposit in a very short geological time interval.\nThe simulation results discussed above are of great significance to the uranium mineralization in the Xiangshan Basin. The formation of uranium deposits requires sufficient uranium-bearing hydrothermal fluids to circulate at the mineralizing sites. The presence of the red beds may have contributed to the uranium mineralization by providing oxidizing fluids. More importantly, the topographic relief of the red beds may act as driving force for fluids to infiltrate into the deep volcanic rocks as well as the basement, and uranium in the volcanic rocks was leached out and enriched in the oxidizing basinal fluids. Uranium may be deposited in fractures where U-bearing fluids encountered reducing agents such as reducing deep-sourced fluids at later stage. The results of this study may have implications for other hydrothermal uranium deposits (e.g., granite-type uranium deposits) spatially related to the red beds in South China.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study is devoted to the quantitative examination of the roles of red beds on fluid flow in the Xiangshan Basin. The topographic variation of the red beds may act as one of the driving forces of fluid flow to infiltrate into the deep volcanic rocks as well as the basement in the Xiangshan Basin. Fluid flow rates were not strongly sensitive to the thickness of the red beds but depended greatly on the slope gradient of the red beds. High permeability red beds could enlarge the depth of the fluid flow and supply oxidizing chemical substances. The presence of faults in the volcanic rocks increases the permeability and enhance the fluid flow.\n\n","8":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Gejiu tin polymetallic ore district is the largest known primary Sn accumulation in the world, with an estimated endowment of 3.2 Mt of Sn, 3.3 Mt of Cu, 5.2 Mt of Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn, and more than 0.2 Mt of W. There are five types of Sn mineralization, i.e., (i) Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Cu ore within altered granites, (ii) Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Cu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0W skarn ore, (iii) Sn greisen ore, (iv) carbonate-hosted stratiform Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Pb\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Zn\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Cu ore, and (v) carbonate-hosted tourmaline veins with Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Be\u00a0\u2212\u00a0W ore (Cheng et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). The Gejiu district includes two areas of contrasting surface geology and mineralization that are separated by the N-S striking Gejiu Fault. To the east of the fault, surface exposures are dominated by Triassic carbonates, whereas to the west of the fault different types of Late Cretaceous magmatic rocks predominate (Fig. 1\nc). To the east of the Gejiu Fault, there are several major deposits, i.e., the Malage (Sn-Cu), the Songshujiao (Sn-Cu-Pb), the Gaosong (Sn-Pb-Zn), the Laochang (Sn-W-Cu), and the Kafang (Sn-Cu) deposits (Fig. 1c). Major mineralization is closely related to fault zones and their intersections (Jiang et al., 1997; Zhao et al, 2015). To the west of the Gejiu Fault, mineralization is only sporadic with small Pb-Sn ore bodies. The largest mined Sn-Pb ore is the Douyan deposit with an estimated endowment of 651\u00a0t of primary Sn ore and 330\u00a0t of alluvial Sn ore (308 Geological Party, 1984; He et al., 2014; Lu and Liu, 2020). The areas to the east and to the west of the Gejiu Fault not only have a different distribution of mineralization, but also contrasting fault pattern (Jiang et al., 1997; Tan et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015).\nPrimary Sn mineralization in the Gejiu district is spatially and genetically linked to Late Cretaceous granites. To the east of the Gejiu Fault, granitic intrusions are not exposed, except for a granite area (\u223c6 km2) to the north of the Malage deposit, but reach to a depth of 200 to 1000\u00a0m below the surface. Unexposed granitic bodies with major deposits include the Malage-Songshujiao porphyritic granite, the Laochang porphyritic granite, and the Laochang-Kafang equigranular granite. To the west of the Gejiu Fault, exposures of granitoids cover an area of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0320\u00a0km2 (Fig. 1c), the most important intrusions being the Longchahe porphyritic granitic body and the Shenxianshui equigranular granitic body. In addition to these granitoids, there occur also gabbros (\u223c10\u00a0km2), syenites (\u223c45\u00a0km2), and a relatively small granitic body (\u223c14\u00a0km2) with abundant mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs; Fig. 1c). Such rocks are not known to the east of the Gejiu Fault. One key question in understanding the metallogeny of the Gejiu district addresses the causes for the different distribution of mineralization. Have major deposits to the west of the Gejiu Fault not been found yet, have they been removed because a deeper crustal level is exposed, or did major deposits just not form because of differences in magma source and development or differences in tectonic setting to the east and the west of the Gejiu Fault?\nNot all granites have associated Sn mineralization. Tin granites are chemically highly evolved, relatively reduced rocks that are derived from partial melting of crustal source rocks (e.g., Heinrich, 1990; Lehmann et al., 1990; Sato, 2012). Tin granites commonly show a strong enrichment in Sn, W, Be, Cs, F, B, Li, Rb, Ta, and U, a marked depletion in Fe, Ti, Mg, Ca, Sr, Eu, Ba, and Zr, and low Fe2O3\/FeO values (e.g., Stussi, 1989; Lehmann, 1990; Breiter et al., 2005). The absence of mineralization associated with such granitic rocks could be due to a wide range of causes, including: (i) insufficient magmatic fractionation (e.g., Fogliata et al., 2012; Ballouard et al., 2016; Azadbakht et al., 2020); (ii) too low melting temperatures in the source of the granitic rocks, with Sn being concentrated in stable residual phases and leading to Sn poor melts (Romer and Kroner, 2016; Wolf et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019); (iii) oxidizing rather than reducing conditions during magma fractionation favoring the crystallization of magnetite and titanite that may incorporate significant amount of Sn and, thus, preventing the enrichment of Sn in residual, volatile-rich melts (Ishihara et al., 1979; Chen et al., 1992a; Wang et al., 2013). The exsolution of magmatic fluids in highly evolved granitic systems typically results in the redistribution of metals that were incompatible during magmatic fractionation and leads to strong alteration of magmatic minerals. Fluid exsolution and alteration of the magmatic mineral assemblage result in chemical changes of the granites. Therefore, the chemical characteristics of accessory minerals that are likely to preserve their original composition such as zircon, apatite, titanite, and monazite, have been increasingly used as proxy for magma development (e.g., Ballard et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2016; Palma et al., 2019; Xing et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2020a, b).\nIn this paper, we study possible causes for the contrasting distribution and size of mineralization in the two areas separated by the Gejiu Fault. In a first step, we compare granitoids from the eastern and western parts of the Gejiu district, using whole rock chemistry and Nd isotope data, zircon U-Pb dating and Hf-O isotope data, and apatite major and trace element data of granitic rocks from. Based on these data we argue that (i) most granites to the west of the Gejiu Fault are not likely to produce major Sn mineralization and that (ii) a few granites to the west of the Gejiu Fault have the same chemical fingerprint as granitic rocks with important Sn mineralization to the east of the fault. The latter point indicates that the absence of major deposits to the west of the Gejiu fault is not due to the absence of fertile granites. In a second step, we discuss whether the present erosion level and the stress field at the time of granite emplacement contribute to the contrasting exposure of mineralization to the east and the west of the Gejiu Fault. Finally, we argue that the absence of major deposits to the west of the fault possibly is related to contrasting conditions of emplacement, most importantly the orientation of the local stress field.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\n\n2.1\nRegional setting of the Gejiu district\nThe Gejiu Sn-polymetallic ore district is located near the southwestern margin of the South China Block (Fig. 1a), which hosts several major Sn provinces. The southeastern margin of the South China Block experienced several phases of arc magmatism related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate (Hu et al., 2015). Several phases of back-arc crustal extension related to reorganization of the subduction zone resulted in the formation of major Sn and W mineralization. The most important phases of mineralization were at 160\u2013140 and 120\u2013100\u00a0Ma (Mao et al., 2013, 2019). To the southwest, the South China Block bordered to the Paleo-Tethys that became closed during the Triassic accretion of Sibumasu (Metcalfe, 2002; Zi et al., 2012). Intrusion of 240\u2013220\u00a0Ma granites, locally with important Sn-W mineralization, was associated with this collision, in particular along the developing active plate margin to the SW of Sibumasu (Wai-Pan Ng et al., 2015).\nThe most prominent expression along the former Paleo-Tethys margin of the South China Block is the Ailaoshan Fault Zone that has been recurrently reactivated during sinistral and dextral strike-slip movements (Deng et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Activity along the Ailaoshan Fault Zone was coeval with the accretion of magmatic arcs to mainland Asia, such as the Kohistan and Gangdese arcs, and with the collision Indian of the Indian subcontinent with mainland Asia (Searle et al., 2016; Sloan et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019). The contrasting processes affecting the southern margin of the South China Block is also reflected in the regional variation of the ages of post-Triassic Sn mineralization (Fig. 1b). To the east, Sn mineralization falls in two age groups, i.e., 160\u2013140\u00a0Ma and 120\u2013100\u00a0Ma (Mao et al. 2013) and their formation seems to be controlled by the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate, in particular the rollback of the slab with related back-arc extension (Mao et al., 2019). To the west, Sn mineralization falls in the age range of 80\u201340\u00a0Ma and are mainly related to the Neo-Tethys suturing (Gardiner et al., 2015). Tin deposits along the former suture of the Paleo-Tethys, in particular along the Ailaoshan Fault Zone, and seems to related neither to the tectonics of the Paleo-Pacific plate nor the Indian plate (see also Chen et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the Gejiu district\nThe Gejiu district is near the former margin of the South China Block, i.e., the Ailaoshan Fault Zone, that was reactivated as a major strike slip fault zone during the Cretaceous and Tertiary collisions of the Kohistan and Gangdese arcs and of India, i.e., during the closure of the Meso-Tethys and the Neo-Tethys (Hu et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2019). The Gejiu district is located to the north of the Ailaoshan Fault Zone at a position where this crustal-scale tectonic element makes a kink and N-S striking Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault connect with the Ailaoshan Fault (Fig. 1a). The N-S striking Gejiu Fault, which is the southern extension of the regional N-S striking Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault, represents the dominant structure in the Gejiu ore district, separating two areas of contrasting structural style, sedimentary and magmatic rocks, and mineralization.\n\n(i) Structural style. To the east of the N-S striking Gejiu Fault, there are three sets of faults, striking E-W, NNE-SSW, and NW-SE, respectively (Fig. 1c). The NW-SE and E-W striking faults, including Baishachong, Songshujiao, Beiyinshan, Mengzimiao, Laoxiongdong, and Xianrendong faults, are interpreted to be main pathways for the ore-forming fluids (Jiang et al., 1997). To the west of the Gejiu Fault, the dominating faults are NNE-striking, such as the Longchahe, Jiaodingshan, and Yangjiatian faults, whereas E-W and NW-SE striking faults are less developed and mainly occur in the peripheral area of the granitic intrusions (Fig. 1c). In the central part of the western area, where major granitic bodies were emplaced, E-W and NW-SE striking faults are rare.\n\n(ii) Sedimentary and magmatic rocks. The Gejiu district has a Proterozoic metamorphic basement that is covered by Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. The sedimentary sequence is incomplete: Silurian, Jurassic, and Cretaceous strata are absent. The sedimentary rocks are dominated by passive margin rocks, with interbedded Cambrian to Ordovician sandstones and dolomitic limestones (not exposed in the map area), upper Devonian to lower Permian carbonate rocks, and Triassic siltstones, shales, and carbonate rocks (Fig. 1c). In the Gejiu ore district, exposed sedimentary rocks mainly belong to the Middle Triassic Gejiu and Falang formations (Chen et al., 1992b). The Gejiu Formation consists of limestones, argillaceous limestones, and dolomitic limestones and occurs mainly to the east of the Gejiu Fault and to the north of the exposed major granitic intrusions (Fig. 1c). The Falang Formation includes siltstones and shale. It occurs to the west of the Gejiu Fault (Fig. 1c). The rocks of the Falang Formation were deposited on top of the rocks of the Gejiu Formation (Chen et al., 1992b).\nThe oldest magmatic rocks exposed in the Gejiu ore district are Middle Triassic basalts, whereas the most voluminous magmatic rocks are Late-Cretaceous intrusive rocks, ranging from gabbros to syenites and granitoids (Supplementary Material 1). To the east of the Gejiu Fault, the Late-Cretaceous magmatic rocks are equigranular and porphyritic granites. Most of the granites are not exposed and reach to a depth of 200 to 1000\u00a0m below the surface. There are, however, small outcrops of the Baishachong equigranular granite and the Beipaotai porphyritic granite to the north of the Malage deposit (Fig. 1c). The granitic bodies of Malage-Songshujiao (porphyritic granite), Laochang (porphyritic granite), and Laochang-Kafang (equigranular granite) have associated Sn deposits, i.e., the Malage Sn-Cu deposit, the Songshujiao Sn-Cu-Pb deposit, the Gaosong Sn-Pb-Zn deposit, the Laochang Sn-W-Cu deposit, and the Kafang Sn-Cu deposit (Fig. 1c). The porphyritic granites are mainly composed of K-feldspar (\u223c33 %), plagioclase (\u223c31 %), quartz (\u223c26 %), and biotite (\u223c8 %), with accessory contributions of zircon, apatite, titanite, ilmenite, allanite, magnetite, and\/or monazite (Cheng and Mao, 2010). The equigranular granites mainly consist of microcline (\u223c40 %), plagioclase (\u223c25 %), quartz (\u223c30 %), and biotite (\u223c3 %) with accessory zircon, apatite, titanite, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, tourmaline, and\/or fluorite (Cheng and Mao, 2010).\nTo the west of the Gejiu Fault, magmatic rocks include gabbro, syenite, and various granitoids, which are well exposed. Granitic rocks are dominated by the Longchahe porphyritic granitic and Shenxianshui equigranular granitic bodies (Fig. 1c). The outcrop area of the Longchahe granitic body, which is the largest intrusion in the Gejiu district, is about 200\u00a0km2. The Longchahe granite mainly consists of microcline (\u223c33 %), plagioclase (\u223c31 %), quartz (\u223c26 %), biotite (\u223c8 %) and amphibole (\u223c1 %) with accessory zircon, apatite, titanite, allanite, and magnetite (Guo, 2019). The Shenxianshui granitic body is medium to coarse grained with microcline (\u223c35 %), plagioclase (\u223c25 %), quartz (\u223c30 %), and biotite (\u223c3 %) and the accessory minerals zircon, apatite, titanite, tourmaline, and magnetite (Zhang et al., 2011). In the Jiasha area, there is a granitic body with mafic microgranular enclaves (Fig. 1c). This granite is mainly composed of plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, amphibole, and quartz with minor apatite, zircon, titanite, and magnetite (Zhang et al., 2013). The mafic microgranular enclaves contain plagioclase, hornblende, biotite, K-feldspar, and quartz, with rare titanite, zircon, magnetite, and apatite (Cheng et al., 2012a). To the west of the Gejiu Fault there is also gabbro and syenite. The gabbro consists of pyroxene, plagioclase, amphibole, and biotite with rare zircon, titanite, magnetite, and apatite (Cheng et al., 2012a). Syenite, which mainly outcrops in the Baiyunshan area (Fig. 1c), is fine to medium grained and consists of nepheline, K-feldspar, albite, Ti-rich andradite (melanite), biotite, aegirine-augite, and sodalite and the accessory minerals fluorite, titanite, zircon, ilmenite, rutile, and allanite (Cheng et al., 2013b).\n\n(iii) Primary granite-related mineralization. To the east of the Gejiu Fault, there are five major deposits, i.e., the Malage (Sn-Cu), the Songshujiao (Sn-Cu-Pb), the Gaosong (Sn-Pb-Zn), the Laochang (Sn-W-Cu), and the Kafang (Sn-Cu) deposits, which are hosted by granite and their carbonate wall rocks. At the contact zone between the granite and carbonate wall rocks, there occur skarn-type Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Cu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0W mineralization with scheelite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, bismuthinite, and cassiterite (Cheng et al., 2013a). In the carbonate wall rocks at some distance from the contact of the intrusion, there occur stratiform Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Pb\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Zn\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Cu ores (Cheng et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2020). The mineralization consists of pyrrhotite, cassiterite, pyrite, hematite, limonite, goethite, malachite, conichalcite, anglesite, cerusite, plumbojarosite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, Fe-rich sphelarite, and galena with variable amounts of quartz, tourmaline, tremolite, and fluorite. Some ores hosted in the carbonates have complex shapes including lenticular, irregularly banded, and veined bodies that are directly related to faults (Jiang et al., 1997). Skarn and carbonate-hosted stratiform ores are the most important mineralization types and occur in all major sediment-hosted deposits. Apart from that, there is Sn-Cu mineralization within the Laochang-Kafang granite (Xu et al., 2021). The granite is variably altered and ore minerals including chalcopyrite and stannite occur in the most strongly altered sections of the granite, especially in steeply plunging veins. In the Laochang deposit, tourmaline veins with Sn\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Be\u00a0\u2212\u00a0W mineralization occur in the carbonate wall rocks above cupolas of unexposed granite (Cheng et al., 2012b). Metal zoning is well developed in the ore district with a change from Sn\u00a0+\u00a0Cu to Sn\u00a0+\u00a0Pb and to Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn mineralization from the granite to the carbonate wall-rocks (Jiang et al., 1997). Syntectonic mineralization occurred along dilatational jogs utilized by E-W oriented dextral faults (Jiang et al., 1997) indicating NW-SE directed regional compression with a dextral Ailaoshan Fault and a sinistral Gejiu Fault in the Late Cretaceous.\nTo the west of the Gejiu Fault, mineralization is sporadically distributed and deposits are generally only very small. The dominant ore elements in mineralization to the west of the Gejiu Fault are Pb and Sn. Ore bodies are mainly hosted in the wall rocks and the highest concentrations of ore elements are associated with the E-W and NNE-SSW striking faults (Zhang et al., 2015; Lu and Liu, 2020). Most ore bodies have been strongly weathered or oxidized. Because of their smaller size, mineralization to the west of the Gejiu Fault has been relatively little studied. There are only three deposits that have been mined (Lu and Liu, 2020; Fig. 1c): (i) the Douyan Sn-Pb deposit consists of strongly oxidized ore bodies hosted in carbonate rocks of the Gejiu Formation at the contact to the Ailaoshan Fault Zone; (ii) the Mengzong Pb deposit, consisting of strongly oxidized ore bodies with galena, cerussite, anglesite, and mimetite, is hosted in interlayer fracture zones on the surface of tuff and marlstone of the Falang Formation to the south of the Longchahe intrusion; and (iii) the Xiazhichang Pb deposit with complex lenticular ore bodies and irregular veins, in particular along E-W striking faults, is hosted in brecciated limestones and platy limestones of the Gejiu Formation.\n\n\n\n3\nSamples and methods\n\n3.1\nSamples\nGranitoids to both sides of the Gejiu Fault have been sampled to expand the published data base. To the east of the Gejiu Fault, eight samples of the Laochang-Kafang granitic body were collected from the Zhuyeshan tunnel in the Laochang ore field. To the west of the Gejiu Fault, we collected five samples from the Shenxianshui granitic body, two samples from the Jiasha granitic body, and three samples from the Longchahe granitic body. One sample from each granitic rock was used for zircon analysis. Two samples from the Zhuyeshan granite and one sample each from the Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitic rocks were used for apatite analysis.\n\n\n3.2\nWhole-rock chemical analysis\nGranitic rock samples were washed and weathered surfaces were removed. The fresh portions of the samples were crushed and ground to less than 200 mesh. Whole rock major and trace element contents were determined at the Geochemistry Lab of China University of Geosciences, Beijing. Major element contents were determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (Leeman Prodigy ICP-OES). Reference materials AGV-2, GSR-3, GSR-1, and GSR-5 were used as standards. Trace element contents were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Agilent-7500a ICP-MS). The standards AGV-2, BHVO-2, W-2 (U.S. Geological Survey), and GSR-3, GSR-1, and GSR-5 (National Geological Standard Reference Materials of China) were used to monitor the analytical accuracy. The analytical uncertainty is\u00a0less than\u00a05% for most trace elements, except\u00a0less than\u00a015% for P, K, and\u00a0less than\u00a010% for Cr, Sc, Cu, Zn, and Sr. Detailed procedures of major and trace element analysis are given by Zhong (2015).\n\n\n3.3\nWhole-rock Nd isotope analysis\nNeodymium was separated and purified at the Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, Peking University. Whole rock powders were dissolved in a mixture of HNO3\u00a0+\u00a0HF for seven days at 80\u2103 on the hot plate. REEs were separated on cation exchange columns filled with AG50W-X8 200 mesh resin. Neodymium was separated from the other REEs using a second cation-exchange column filled with P507 200 mesh resin. The Nd isotopic composition was determined on a Thermo-Finnigan TRITON thermal ionization mass spectrometer at the Tianjin Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources, China Geological Survey. Neodymium reference material LIRG gave 143Nd\/144Nd\u00a0=\u00a00.512202\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 (2\u03c3, n\u00a0=\u00a03).\n\n\n3.4\nU-Pb dating, trace element analysis, and Hf-O isotope analysis of zircon\nZircon grains were separated using heavy liquids and magnetic methods and purified by handpicking under a binocular microscope. Zircon grains were mounted in an epoxy block and polished to expose the central sections of the crystals. The zircon grains were examined under transmitted and reflected light. Cathodoluminescence images were used to select domains for in situ elemental and isotopic analysis.\nZircon U-Pb dating and trace element analysis were conducted at Mineral and Fluid Inclusion Microanalysis Lab, Geology Institute, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing, using an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS coupled with an NWR 193UC laser ablation system (LA-ICP-MS). The analyses were performed using 30\u00a0\u03bcm spot diameter, 5\u00a0Hz repetition rate, and 2\u00a0J\/cm2 laser fluence. Zircon 91,500 was used as primary reference material and GJ-1 and Ple\u0161ovice zircon were used as secondary reference materials. NIST 610 and 91Zr were used as external reference material and internal standard element, respectively, to calibrate trace element contents. Data reduction was conducted using the Iolite software package (Paton et al., 2010) and weighted mean 206Pb\/238U ages were calculated using the Isoplot program (Ludwig, 2003).\nIn situ zircon Hf isotope analysis was conducted at the National Research Center of Geoanalysis (Beijing) using a MC-ICP-MS (Neptune Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a femto-second (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0343\u00a0nm) laser ablation system (J-200, Applied Spectra). The laser was operated at\u00a0\u223c\u00a07\u00a0J\/cm2 fluence and 10\u00a0Hz repetition rate. The analyzed areas were approximately 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcm. Detailed analytical procedures and data reduction procedures are given in Zhou et al. (2018).\nIn situ zircon O isotope analysis was conducted using a Cameca IMS 1280-HR at the SIMS Laboratory of Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GIGCAS). The analyses were performed using 10\u00a0kV acceleration voltage, 2nA beam current, and 10\u00a0\u03bcm beam diameter. Two reference zircon samples 91,500 and TEMORA 2, used to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy, gave values consistent within error with the recommended values. The Penglai zircon was used as an external reference material to calibrate instrumental mass fractionation. Detailed analytical procedures and data reduction procedures are given in Yang et al. (2018).\n\n\n3.5\nMajor and trace element analysis of apatite\nApatite major element contents were determined by electron microprobe using a JEOL-JXA8230 at the Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), Beijing, China. The minerals were analyzed using 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage, 20nA beam current, and 5\u00a0\u03bcm spot diameter. The analytical error are less than 0.5 % for most elements.\nApatite trace element contents were measured using LA-ICP-MS at the In situ Mineral Geochemistry Lab, Ore Deposit and Exploration Centre (ODEC), Hefei University of Technology, China. The analyses were carried out on an Agilent 7900 Quadrupole ICP-MS coupled to a Photon Machines Analyte HE 193-nm ArF Excimer Laser Ablation system, using\u00a0\u223c\u00a04\u00a0J\/cm2 fluence, 8\u00a0Hz repetition rate, and 30\u00a0\u03bcm spot diameter. Each analysis involved measuring the gas blank for 20\u00a0s and the sample for 40\u00a0s. Ca was used as internal standard and NIST 610, NIST 612, and BCR 2G were used as external standard materials. Standard reference materials were run after each 10 unknowns. Detection limits were calculated for each element and each spot analysis. Off-line data processing was performed using ICPMSDataCal (Liu et al., 2008). Analytical uncertainties were generally less than 10 % for most of the trace elements.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nWhole-rock chemical data\nMajor and trace element compositions of the Zhuyeshan (to the east of the Gejiu Fault) and Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe (to the west of the Gejiu Fault) granitic rock samples are presented in Table 1\n.\nSamples from the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites have similar chemical compositions although they come from opposite sides of the Gejju Fault. The Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites are characterized by high contents of SiO2 (71.2 to 75.7\u00a0wt%) and low contents of TiO2 (0.13 to 0.30\u00a0wt%), TFe2O3 (1.24 to 2.80\u00a0wt%), MgO (0.15 to 0.59\u00a0wt%), CaO (0.49 to 1.65\u00a0wt%), and P2O5 (0.012 to 0.185\u00a0wt%). The contents of TFe2O3, MgO, CaO, and P2O5 show relatively small variations (Fig. 2\nb-e). The granitic rocks from Zhuyeshan to Shenxianshui show a decrease of Al2O3 (14.4 to 11.7\u00a0wt%) with increasing SiO2 (Fig. 2a, g). Samples from these two granites have similar Na2O and K2O contents of 2.79 to 3.77\u00a0wt% and 4.16 to 5.69\u00a0wt%, respectively, plot in the granite field in the SiO2 vs. Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O diagram (Fig. 3\na), and belong to the high-K calc-alkaline series (Fig. 3b). Compared with the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites, the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids have lower contents of SiO2 (62.6 to 70.0\u00a0wt%) and higher contents of TiO2 (0.43 to 0.97\u00a0wt%), TFe2O3 (2.79 to 5.74\u00a0wt%), MgO (0.81 to 2.07\u00a0wt%), CaO (1.58 to 4.06\u00a0wt%), P2O5 (0.182 to 0.418\u00a0wt%), and Al2O3 (14.2 to 17.2\u00a0wt%; Fig. 2a-e and g). In addition, the Jiasha granitoid have higher SiO2 and lower TFe2O3, MgO, CaO, and P2O5 than the Longchahe granitoid (Fig. 2a-e). Samples from the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids show similar Na2O (3.14\u20133.70\u00a0wt%) and K2O (4.33\u20136.10\u00a0wt%) contents as the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites (Fig. 2h, i), most samples plot in the quartz monzonite field in the SiO2 vs. Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O diagram (Fig. 3a), and belong to the shoshonitic series (Fig. 3b).\n\nFig. 4\n shows trace element pattern (normalized to upper continental crust, UCC; Rudnick and Gao, 2003) of the samples from the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids. There are two types of pattern, i.e., the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granitic rocks have similar pattern that differ significantly from those of the Jiasha and Longchahe granitic rocks. The Zhuyeshan granite samples are characterized by flat REE pattern, a deep Eu anomaly, and a pronounced tetrade effect. Apart from Eu, the pattern show marked depletions in V, Cr, Co, Ni, Sr, and Ba, and distinct peaks for Li, Rb, Nb, Sn, Cs, Ta, Pb, Th, and U. Samples from the Shenxianshui granite also show a tetrade effect, but show slightly higher LREE and Li enrichment, more variable negative Eu anomalies, and stronger depletions of Sc, V, Cr, Co, and Ni than samples from the Zhuyeshan granite. In comparison with these two granites, the samples from the Jiasha and Longchahe intrusions show a strong LREE enrichment and only slightly negative Eu anomalies (Jiasha) or no Eu anomalies (Longchahe). Furthermore, the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids show higher contents for Ba, Sr, Sc, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, Zr, and Hf and lower contents of Rb, Cs, Ta, and U than samples from the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites. We estimated the melting temperatures of the granitic melts using the zircon saturation thermometer of Watson and Harrison (1983). The Zr contents of the samples from the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids are 112\u2013226\u00a0ppm, 189\u2013230\u00a0ppm, 242\u2013263\u00a0ppm, and 292\u2013399\u00a0ppm, respectively (Table 1), the corresponding zircon saturation temperatures are 760\u2013823 \u2103, 785\u2013813 \u2103, 813\u2013830 \u2103, and 802\u2013831 \u2103, respectively.\n\n\n4.2\nWhole rock Nd isotopic composition\nMeasured and initial whole-rock Nd isotopic compositions are presented in Table 2\n. The initial isotopic compositions of Nd was calculated for an U-Pb zircon age of 83\u00a0Ma. The \u03b5Nd(t) values of the Zhuyeshan granite range from\u00a0\u2212\u00a09.0 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a08.3. The \u03b5Nd(t) values of granitoids to the west of the Gejiu Fault are slightly higher than those of the Zhuyeshan granite, ranging from\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.3 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.0 (Shenxianshui), \u22127.8 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.7 (Jiasha), and\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.6 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.1 (Longchahe), respectively. The corresponding two-stage model ages (Liew and Hofmann, 1988) are 1564 to 1506\u00a0Ma (Zhuyeshan), 1424 to 1401\u00a0Ma (Shenxianshui), 1466 to 1459\u00a0Ma (Jiasha), and 1450 to 1412\u00a0Ma (Longchahe), respectively. Note, two-stage model ages are preferred here, as the more evolved granites show a tetrade effect and, thus, their REE pattern strongly differ from the ones of the protolith of the granites, typically yielding incorrect single-stage model ages.\n\n\n4.3\nZircon U-Pb ages, trace element, and Hf-O isotopic compositions\nThe results of zircon U-Pb dating, trace element analysis, and Hf and O isotope analysis are presented in the Supplementary Material 2. Zircon crystals from the granitoids are enhedral and cathodoluminescence images typically show magmatic oscillatory zoning, which indicates that the zircon crystals have a magmatic origin. Measured Th\/U ratios generally fall in the range from 0.2 to 1.7 (Supplementary Material 2). The weighted mean 206Pb\/238U ages of the granitoids are 82.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48\u00a0Ma (Zhuyeshan), 82.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62\u00a0Ma (Shenxianshui), 82.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58\u00a0Ma (Jiasha), and 83.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.52\u00a0Ma (Longchahe), respectively (Fig. 5\n). These ages indicate that the granitic rocks distributed to both sides of the Gejiu Fault were emplaced at the same time.\nThe zircon Eu anomaly (Eu\/Eu*) of the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, and Jiasha granitoids generally fall in the same range (0.01 to 0.31), whereas the Longchahe granitoid generally have higher Eu\/Eu* ratios (0.19\u20130.42; Fig. 6\na). All four types of the granitoids have similar zircon Ce\/Ce* anomalies (3\u2013219; Fig. 6a) and calculated Ti-in-zircon temperatures (674\u2013905 \u2103; Ferry and Watson, 2007). The magma oxygen fugacity (fO2) was calculated using zircon trace element data (Loucks et al., 2020). The granitoids have similar calculated logfO2 values that correspond to \u0394FMQ values ranging from\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.19 to 2.67, with most values being less than zero (Fig. 6b).\nThe Hf isotopic compositions of the dated zircon grains correspond to calculated \u03b5Hf(t) values ranging from\u00a0\u2212\u00a08.2 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.9 (Zhuyeshan), \u22126.6 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.7 (Shenxianshui), \u22127.8 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a04.9 (Jiasha), and\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.8 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a04.0 (Longchahe). These \u03b5Hf(t) values corresponded to TDM2 ages ranging from 1676 to 1522\u00a0Ma (Zhuyeshan), 1566 to 1409\u00a0Ma (Shenxianshui with one younger model age at 1318\u00a0Ma), 1640 to 1457\u00a0Ma (Jiasha), and 1643 to 1408\u00a0Ma (Longchahe). Although the data for the various granitoids fall in relatively narrow, overlapping clusters, a few analyses from the Shenxianshui granite yield slightly higher \u03b5Hf(t) values (Fig. 7\na). The \u03b418O values of the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitic rocks range from 7.30 to 8.95 \u2030, 9.12 to 10.28 \u2030, 8.16 to 9.12 \u2030, and 7.99 to 9.32 \u2030, respectively. Most samples have \u03b418O values in the range from 8 to 9 \u2030, but some samples from the Shenxianshui granite have slightly higher \u03b418O values and two samples from Zhuyeshan granite have lower \u03b418O values (Fig. 7a).\n\n\n4.4\nApatite major and trace element compositions\nMajor and trace element compositions of apatite from the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitic rocks are presented in Supplementary Material 3. The CaO, P2O5, and SiO2 contents of apatite range from 52.5 to 57.0\u00a0wt%, 36.5 to 43.0\u00a0wt%, and from below the detection limit to 0.64\u00a0wt%, respectively. Apatite from the Zhuyeshan granite has relatively large ranges of MnO (up to 1.07\u00a0wt%) and FeO (up to 0.52\u00a0wt%) contents, whereas the corresponding ranges for the Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitic rocks are below 0.22\u00a0wt% MnO and below 0.10\u00a0wt% FeO. Apatite from all granitic rocks is enriched in F (2.34 to 5.42\u00a0wt%), whereas the content of SO3 is below 0.47\u00a0wt%.\n\nFig. 8\n shows the rare earth element pattern of apatite from the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids. For the Zhuyeshan granite, apatite from whole rock sample ZYS-29 show flat REE pattern with deep negative Eu anomalies, weakly positive Ce anomalies, and slightly negative La anomalies, whereas apatite from whole rock sample ZYS-28 show LREE enrichment and HREE depletion. Apatite from the Zhuyeshan granite has low Sr (52 to 286\u00a0ppm) and high Y (1087 to 5291\u00a0ppm) contents (Fig. 9\n). In comparison with the Zhuyeshan granite, the patterns of apatite from the Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids are similar to the pattern of apatite from the whole rock sample ZYS-28 that is characterized by LREE enrichment and HREE depletion with variably negative Eu anomalies. Apatite from the Shenxianshui granite has similar Sr and Y contents (130\u2013373\u00a0ppm Sr, 317\u20133194\u00a0ppm Y) as those from the Zhuyeshan granite, whereas apatite from the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids have higher Sr (177\u2013641\u00a0ppm) and lower Y (196\u2013675\u00a0ppm) contents (Fig. 9).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nGranite chemistry as proxy for Sn mineralization in the Gejiu area\n\n\n(i) Age of magmatism\n. The weighted mean 206Pb\/238U ages of the Zhuyeshan, Shenxianshui, Jiashan, and Longchahe granitoids are around 83\u00a0Ma (Fig. 5). Therefore, the Cretaceous granitoids to the east and west of the Gejiu Fault should have formed during the same tectonic event. The mineralization ages of the major deposits formed to the east of the Gejiu Fault were determined by mica 40Ar-39Ar dating (95 to 77\u00a0Ma, Cheng et al., 2013a), molybdenite Re-Os dating (86 to 83\u00a0Ma, Cheng et al., 2012b), and cassiterite U-Pb dating (85 to 84\u00a0Ma, Guo et al., 2018; 83 to 77\u00a0Ma, Cheng et al., 2019). To the west of the Gejiu Fault, gabbro, syenite, and mafic microgranular enclaves have zircon U-Pb ages of 83.3\u00a0Ma, 79.2\u00a0Ma, and 83.1\u00a0Ma, respectively (Cheng and Mao, 2010). Late Cretaceous magmatic rocks to the east and west sides of the Gejiu Fault and primary Sn mineralization in the Gejiu district formed at the same time.\n\n\n(ii) Source rocks\n. The Zhuyeshan granite to the east of the Gejiu Fault and the Shenxianshu, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids to the west of the Gejiu Fault show a very narrow range of whole-rock Nd isotopic compositions, with \u03b5Nd(t) values ranging from\u00a0\u2212\u00a09.0 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.0 (Table 2). The corresponding two-stage model ages (Liew and Hofmann, 1988) range from 1564 to 1401\u00a0Ma. Hafnium isotope data from magmatic zircon yield the same range of model ages as the whole rock Nd isotope data. The Mesoproterozoic model ages indicate significant contributions from old continental crust to the source of the granitoids.\nThe predominance of crustal source rocks is supported by zircon Hf and O isotope data. The \u03b5Hf(t) and \u03b418O values of most samples from the Zhuyeshan, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids fall in a narrow and overlapping cluster and show minor incorporation of mantle derived material (Fig. 7a). Data from the Shenxianshui granite in part have higher \u03b418O values, which may indicate intense chemical weathering of the sedimentary protoliths. The whole rock Nd and the zircon Hf and O isotope data demonstrate that the granitoids to both sides of the Gejiu Fault are dominantly derived from metasedimentary rocks whose sources experienced intense chemical weathering before sedimentation and burial. Contributions of mantle-derived magma, locally preserved in mafic microgranular enclaves, are minor.\n\n\n(iii) Melting conditions\n. Melting temperature is critical for Sn-enrichment in the melt: low temperature melting (muscovite dehydration melting) results in enrichment of Sn in restite minerals such as biotite, whereas high temperature melting (biotite dehydration melting) results in the partitioning of Sn into the melt (Romer and Kroner, 2016). This general relation is supported by case studies (Wolf et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019). The melting temperature of the granitic melts was estimated using the zircon saturation thermometer of Watson and Harrison (1983). Samples from the Zhuyeshan granite yield high zircon saturation temperatures (760 to 822 \u2103; Table 1) that fall in a similar range as those of the Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe granitoids to the west of the Gejiu Fault (785 to 831 \u2103; Table 1). These temperature ranges are higher than temperatures typical for muscovite dehydration melting (\u223c720\u2013740 \u2103; Viruete et al., 2000) and reach into the temperature range of biotite dehydration melting (>800 \u2103; Barbero, 1995). The calculated temperatures are likely to represent minimum estimates of the melting temperature due to the absence of inherited zircon in the investigated samples from these granitoids (Miller et al., 2003). Thus, Cretaceous granitoids to both sides of the Gejiu Fault are derived from high-temperature melting of crustal protoliths. The calculated Ti-in-zircon temperatures show a large variation and are significantly lower than the calculated zircon saturation temperatures, possibly indicating that the Ti-in-zircon thermometer does not work reliably in highly evolved rocks with very low Ti contents.\nHigh oxygen fugacity during partial melting of protoliths will stabilize Sn-sequestering phases such as biotite, rutile, and titanite, which in turn will result in the enrichment of Sn in the restite rather than in the melt (Wolf et al., 2018). High oxygen fugacity furthermore favors the crystallization of magnetite and titanite, which may incorporate significant amounts of Sn, during fractional crystallization and, thus, prevent the enrichment of Sn in volatile-rich melts (Ishihara, 1979). The formation of Sn mineralization is favored by low oxygen fugacity during melting and fractional crystallization. The calculated zircon oxygen fugacity (expressed as \u0394FMQ values) of the granitoids overlaps and corresponds to values that are generally more reduced than the FMQ (fayalite\u2013magnetite\u2013quartz) buffer, i.e., that are close or fall below FMQ (Fig. 6b). Thus, the granitic rocks to both sides of the Gejiu Fault have similarly low oxygen fugacity. This is supported by the same range of zircon Ce\/Ce* values (Fig. 6a) that have been used to indicate the redox state of the magma (Burnham and Berry, 2012). In contrast, the relatively large variation in zircon Eu\/Eu* values among the Cretaceous granitic rocks of the Gejiu area is likely to reflect different extents of magma fractionation (Gardiner et al., 2017).\n\n\n(iv) Extent of fractionation\n. Sn mineralization generally is thought to be associated with highly fractionated granites that eventually concentrate Sn in the late-magmatic hydrothermal fluids. Both, the Zhuyeshan and the Shenxianshui granite have flat (or almost flat) UCC-normalized REE patterns with deep Eu anomalies, show variably pronounced tetrade effects, are markedly enriched in Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Hf, and U, and are depleted in Sr, Ba, and Zr (Fig. 4). These chemical signatures are typical for highly evolved magmatic rocks. These signatures are not observed in samples from the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids (Fig. 4). Whole-rock Rb\/Sr ratios are commonly used to indicate the extent of magma fractionation. The Rb\/Sr ratios of the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites have similar ranges (1.93\u20134.42 and 1.89\u20134.06, respectively) and are markedly higher than those of the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids (0.33 to 0.92; Table 1). Therefore, the Jiasha and Longchahe granotoids are less evolved than the Zhuyeshan granite to the east of the Gejiu Fault and the Shenxianshui granite to the west of the Gejiu Fault, which have the composition of highly evolved tin granites (e.g., Olade, 1980; Xu et al., 2015). Rare earth elements of apatite from these granitoids generally show the same pattern characterized by LREE-enrichment and variably negative Eu anomalies that is typical for granitoids (Belousova et al., 2002; Fig. 8). Apatite from the whole rock sample ZYS-29 has higher HREE contents and higher Y contents than apatite from the other granites. Apatite from the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granite has distinctly higher Y contents than apatite from the Jiasha and Longchahe granitoids and shows negative correlation between Y and Sr contents (Fig. 9), which is typical for highly fractionated granites (e.g., Belousova et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2013). Thus, Cretaceous fertile granites occur to the east and the west of the Gejiu Fault.\n\n\n5.2\nSimilar type of magmatism and different mineralization potential to the east and west of the Gejiu Fault: A case for contrasting structural conditions of magma emplacement?\nThere are fertile tin granites to both sides of the Gejiu Fault. Therefore, the contrasting distribution of mineralization between the eastern and western sectors cannot be explained by the presence or absence of fertile tin granites. There are two unrelated alternative explanations for the poorly mineralized western sector: (i) different present-day exposure levels in the western and eastern sectors, implying that mineralization in the western sector may have been removed by erosion or is still at greater depths, whereas mineralization in the eastern sector is close to the present surface; (ii) different orientations of the stress field in the two sectors during the late magmatic processes leading to the formation of the Sn deposits. The spatial distribution of the deposits is structurally controlled by the conjugate fracture system of the Gejiu and Ailaoshan faults (Fig. 1a). For both possible explanations, these faults represent necessary first order structures either by permitting differential uplift and erosion or by separating domains of contrasting stress fields.\nThe deeper level of exposure in the western sector requires differential uplift of the western side along the Gejiu Fault as well as decoupling of both domains along the Ailaoshan Fault. Major erosion after the emplacement of the Cretaceous magmatic rocks would have removed potential Sn mineralization. In such a scenario, there is no essential difference in the formation of primary granite-related Sn deposits. Furthermore, the uplift of the western side and fault activity occurred after the formation of Sn mineralization. Different levels of exposure do not result in contrasting fault pattern to both sides of the Gejiu Fault (Fig. 1c) and the distribution of major mineralization in the eastern sector (Jiang et al., 1997) is controlled by faults (Fig. 10\n). Therefore, post-mineralization tectonic processes do not account for the obvious differences in fault pattern between the two sectors.\nThe granite emplacement occurred during late Cretaceous strike-slip movement along the conjugate Gejiu-Ailaoshan fault system and the local orientation of the stress field may have had a dominant role on the distribution of mineralization, in particular whether economic deposits could evolve at all. In the following sections, we demonstrate how Cretaceous strike-slip movement along the conjugate Gejiu-Ailaoshan fracture system can control the distribution of Sn mineralization in the Gejiu district, in particular the selective occurrence of major deposits in the eastern sector. Note, this explanation does not rule out the possibility that there have been (now eroded) Sn deposits in the western sector, but it makes the possibility of major Sn deposits in the western sector rather unlikely.\n\n\n5.3\nEvidence for tectonic controlled tin mineralization\nThere is growing evidence that the tectonic setting during the emplacement of tin granites controls the concentration of Sn by magmatic fluids. For instance, the voluminous Tertiary leucogranites of the Greater Himalayas and the Cornubian batholiths of SW England have similar geochemical pattern (see Fig. 15 in Romer and Kroner, 2016), but contrasting extent of Sn mineralization. The Cornubian batholiths host the most important Sn province in Europe. These early Permian granites (Chen et al., 1993) were emplaced in an extensional setting, subsequent to the Variscan orogeny when the entire Variscan belt was under extension as mirrored in the distribution of Permian volcanism and Permian fault-bound sedimentary basins (Neumann et al., 2004; Ziegler and D\u00e8zes, 2006). In contrast, there is no economically relevant Sn mineralization known to be associated with the syncollisional Himalayan leucogranites to the north of the main Himalayan thrust, even though cassiterite is known to occur in some of these granites (typically found as byproduct in heavy mineral concentrates prepared for zircon dating; pers. comm. John Cottle, UCSB). The Himalayan Tertiary granites were emplaced in a compressional setting during the ongoing Cenozoic India Asia collision (Crawford and Windley, 1990).\nIn the Central European Variscides, the entire Erzgebirge \u2013 Fichtelgebirge Zone, another major Variscan Sn province, hosts late Variscan tin granites. Because the same heat source is affecting the same protoliths within the Erzgebirge \u2013 Fichtelgebirge Zone (for details see Romer and Kroner, 2015), the tin granites within this zone belong to the same geochemical suite (Siebel et al., 1997; F\u00f6rster, 1999; F\u00f6rster and Romer, 2010). The striking difference in the distribution of Sn mineralization between the Erzgebirge and Fichtelgebirge areas is related to the contrasting tectonic setting during late Variscan granite emplacement. At the time of granite emplacement, the Erzgebirge constitutes a late orogenic transtensional domain (e.g., Willner et al., 2000), whereas the adjacent Fichtelgebirge Zone is characterized by late Variscan compression (Franke and Stein, 2000). Both domains are separated by a huge fault zone, along which a major granite suite was emplaced. The tin granites of the Erzgebirge host important tin mineralization, whereas those in the Fichtelgebirge only show minor mineralization without economic importance.\nThe contrasting development of mineralization in Cornwall and the Greater Himalayas \u2013 as well as in the Erzgebirge-Fichtelgebirge Zone of the Central European Variscides \u2013 indicates that apart from the geochemical character of the granites, the tectonic regime during magma emplacement may be important for the development of mineralization. It seems, that compressional \/ transpessional settings do not allow for the formation of large-scale tin deposits, whereas extensional \/ transtensional settings are favorable for the formation of tin deposits. This is analogue to the formation of hydrothermal vein-type deposits (Sibson, 1996). Extensional \/ transtensional tectonics leads to the formation of steeply-dipping open fluid pathways allowing for the vertical ascent of mineralizing fluids. In contrast, compressional regimes do not result in the formation of such open and interconnected fluid networks. We apply the principles of macro-scale fracturing during the formation of hydrothermal vein-type deposits (Sibson, 1996) and argue that the interplay of ascending fluids and interconnected microcracks is essential for the late-stage redistribution of Sn and the formation of primary granite-related Sn deposits.\n\n\n5.4\nThe role of fluids and the need of an efficient fluid pathway\nDuring late-stage crystallization, the granitic melt becomes saturated in fluids that eventually exsolve. Generally, it is assumed that most metals partition into the fluid (e.g., Heinrich, 1990) and eventually form mineralization within the granite or in the wall rocks. Recent experimental work showed that some ore elements do not partition preferentially into the exsolving magmatic fluid. For instance, W partitions preferentially into the fluid, but Sn partitions preferentially into the melt (Schmidt, 2018; Schmidt et al., 2020). At the scale of an individual intrusion, this contrasting partitioning behavior may account for the spatial separation of Sn and W. At the scale of entire mineral districts, however, other factors, such as melting temperature of sedimentary protoliths, control the distribution of W and Sn mineralization (Yuan et al., 2019).\nPreferential partitioning of Sn into the granitic melt during late stage fluid exsolution eventually leads to granites with disperse cassiterite crystals or with Sn being substituted into silicate minerals, such as titanite and biotite (Breiter and Scharbert, 1995; Wang et al., 2013). Later fluids percolating through these rocks may dissolve magmatic cassiterite and alter Sn-hosting silicates. These later fluids may be magmatic fluids from other, later crystallizing parts of the intrusion (Schmidt et al., 2020) or external fluids that become heated by the intrusion (e.g., Xu et al., 2021). Tin mobilization by Cl-rich fluids is particularly efficient at temperatures above 400\u00a0\u00b0C (Schmidt, 2018). If these fluids also have a low pH, they may induce the formation of greisens and the precipitation of Sn as cassiterite (Schmidt et al., 2020).\nThe final stages of metal concentration involves redistribution of metals via fluids and requires efficient fluid pathways both for mobilization and for concentrating the metals to a deposition volume. Such a network of intersecting pathways must be present at least in the apical part of the granite, where the last-crystallizing melt concentrated before fluid exsolution, and transport of metals that partition into the buoyant fluids to higher crustal levels. Hydraulic (micro) fracturing due to fluid overpressure is able to produce fluid pathways even at higher temperatures (e.g., Lefebvre et al., 2019, Fig. 3). Fluid overpressure reduces the effective stress and may result in tensional fractures (e.g., Twiss and Moores, 1992). The orientation of such fractures is orthogonal to the least principal stress axis, i.e, orthogonal to sigma 3. An anastomosing network of preferentially vertically oriented tensile fractures requires a horizontal sigma 3. Such an orientation of the stress tensor is realized in extensional and strike-slip settings and their combination, i.e., in transtensional settings. In contrast, hydraulic fracturing in compressional regimes should result in the preferred formation of horizontal tensile fractures caused by the vertically arranged sigma 3. Such a preferred orientation hampered the vertical ascent of the exsolved fluid and dissolved metals do not concentrate in veins, greisen, or skarn type mineralization. Instead, ore minerals are disperse distributed within the apical parts of the granite. The contrasting orientations of sigma 3 explain the striking difference between tin granites of Cornwall and the Greater Himalayas. Moreover, if there is a regional contrast in deformation, the adjacent compressional and extensional domains are separated by fault zones, which explains the presence and absence of economically important tin deposits in the Erzgebirge \u2013 Fichtelgebirge area, respectively, and \u2013 by analogy \u2013 the eastern and western sectors of the Gejiu area.\n\n\n5.5\nTectonic model for the spatial distribution of the tin deposits in the Gejiu district\nWe propose that the Gejiu-Ailaoshan fault-system controls the spatial distribution of large Sn deposits in the Gejiu district. The Ailaoshan Fault and the conjugate Gejiu Fault, which is separating the eastern and western sectors, intersect at an angle of ca. 70\u00b0 and 110\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 10). Dextral strike-slip at the Ailaoshan Fault coeval to sinistral strike-slip at the Gejiu Fault results in conjugate Mohr-Coulomb faults, i.e., shear fractures. The western sector is characterized by an acute angle between sigma 1 and both strike-slip faults. Strain partitioning leads to compressional \/ transpressional deformation in the western sector, whereas the eastern sector experiences predominantly extensional \/ transtensional deformation. In such a scenario the NW-SE striking fractures act as (oblique) normal faults, whereas the dominant NE-SW striking faults represent reverse faults (Fig. 10).\nSyntectonic granites to the west of the Gejiu Fault intruded and crystalized in a compressive setting and those to the east intruded in a dilatative setting. In contrast to the western sector, the orientation of the principal stress axis, i.e., sigma 3 in the eastern sector was nearly horizontal, allowing for the formation of an efficient fluid pathway during the final hydrothermal stage. The interconnected and predominantly vertical oriented micro-fractures in the granite resulted in predominantly vertical escape of the Sn bearing fluids culminating in voluminous mineralization of the granite and the country rocks of the roof zone. In contrast, the western sector is characterized by a steeply dipping sigma 3. Due to fluid overpressure microcracking in the granites resulted in predominantly sub-horizontal tension gashes. This structural pattern does not allow for important vertical fluid migration into the roof of the granites and their host rocks. Cassiterite that had crystallized disperse distributed within the granite may become dissolved locally by later fluids, but Sn did not concentrate into major deposits.\nThe Ailaoshan and the Gejiu faults had been repeatedly reactivated as sinistral and dextral faults (e.g., Morley, 2012; Chen et al., 2019). Thus, the same faults that controlled the contrasting mineralizations in a transpressional unmineralized horst in the west and a less uplifted transtensional mineralized domain in the east, also control later tectonic processes, in particular the differential uplift of the two blocks. The granites in the western area intruded into the siliciclastic rocks of the Falang Formation and the eroded units above, whereas in the eastern area the granites only intruded into the Gejiu Formation and did not reach the stratigraphically overlying rocks of the Falang Formation. Thus, the present erosion level is unrelated with the emplacement level of the granites.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe granitic rocks to the east (Zhuyeshan) and west (Shenxianshui, Jiasha, and Longchahe) of the Gejiu Fault show similarities in terms of emplacement ages, source rocks, melting temperature, oxygen fugacity, and extent of fractionation, based on (i) zircon U-Pb ages around 83\u00a0Ma; (ii) low whole rock \u03b5Nd(t) and zircon \u03b5Hf(t) values (\u22129.0 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.0 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a08.2 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.7, respectively), and high zircon \u03b418O values (7.30 to 10.28 \u2030), as well as Mesoproterozoic Nd and Hf two-stage model ages; (iii) high zircon saturation temperatures (760 to 831 \u2103); and (iv) calculated logfO2 values falling below FMQ buffer. Furthermore, the Zhuyeshan and Shenxianshui granites have flat UCC-normalized REE patterns with deep Eu anomalies and tetrade effects, and marked enrichments of Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Hf, and U and depletions of Sr, Ba, and Zr. The geochemical fingerprints of these granitic rocks demonstrate that the absence of major deposits to the west of the Gejiu Fault is not due to the absence of fertile granitic rocks. The contrasting distribution of major deposits does not reflect different levels of exposure (with potential deposits to the west of the fault having been eroded). Instead, the sectors to the east and west of the Gejiu Fault, which have different fault pattern experienced contrasting tectonic settings during the emplacement of the Cretaceous granites. Dextral strike-slip along the Ailaoshan Fault and sinistral strike-slip along the Gejiu Fault result in an extensional \/ transtensional setting in the eastern sector, which favors the circulation of late-magmatic fluids in the roof zones of the granites leading to the formation of major Sn mineralization, and a compressional and transpressional setting in the western sector, which does not favor large-scale fluid circulation and did not lead to significant mineralization.\n\n","9":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Hunjiang basin is a mineral-rich sedimentary basin in southern Jilin Province, northeastern China. It forms part of the Proterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB) that amalgamates the two cratonic masses comprising the Eastern Block of the North China block (NCB; Li and Chen, 2014). The basin consists of Proterozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary and minor volcaniclastic rocks unconformably overlying Archean basement (Wang et al., 2011; Keevil et al., 2019). It is host to more than 100 past and presently producing mining operations, many of which have formed in association with Mesozoic igneous activity (Feng and Zhang, 2004; Han et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Chai et al., 2016). Despite its economic significance, a metallogenic model for the Hunjiang basin is currently lacking as mineral deposit classification in this part of the NCB does not conform to the current understanding of ore-forming processes (Poulsen et al., 1992; Hart et al., 2002).\nThis contribution reports on a comprehensive field study during which a large number of past and producing deposits in the Hunjiang basin were visited, described, and classified to place them within a regional geologic and tectonic context. It is demonstrated that most of the ore deposits are magmatic-hydrothermal in nature and are likely related to emplacement of intermediate to deep porphyritic intrusions. Based on field and laboratory work, a metallogenic model for the Hunjiang basin was developed that links porphyry and skarn deposits with carbonate replacement deposits and distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits. The emplacement of Middle Jurassic subduction-related porphyry intrusions is linked to the subduction of the Izanagi Plate beneath the Eurasian margin whereas middle Cretaceous post-subduction porphyry intrusions in the Hunjiang basin are interpreted to have formed during subsequent slab rollback. This metallogenic model has implications for exploration in southern Jilin Province and contributes to a broader understanding of the spectrum of deposit styles associated with porphyritic intrusions in the northeastern NCB.\n\n\n2\nRegional setting\nThe Hunjiang basin is located along the northeastern margin of the NCB, the largest and oldest of the three cratonic blocks that make up much of China (Fig. 1\n; Yang et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011). Neoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneisses as well as syntectonic granites and supracrustal rocks form \u223c85% of the basement of the NCB and are unconformably overlain by Paleoproterozoic and younger sedimentary cover rocks (Kusky, 2011; Li et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012). The NCB is bordered by the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) to the north (Kusky et al., 2007; Windley et al., 2010; Zhou and Wilde, 2013) and the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu Orogen to the south (Windley et al., 2010; Kusky, 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Zhai and Santosh, 2013).\nThe NCB is subdivided into the Western and Eastern Blocks (Fig. 1; Li et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2004). The Western Block represents a stable continental craton, while the Eastern North China Block (ENCB) has undergone major episodes of deformation and magmatism during the Phanerozoic resulting from lithospheric delamination (Kusky et al., 2007; Keevil et al., 2019). The eastern part of the ENCB consists of the northern Longgang and southern Nangrim Blocks, which are separated by the Paleoproterozoic JLJB that hosts the Hunjiang basin (Luo et al., 2004, 2008; Li et al., 2006; Tam et al., 2011; Li and Chen, 2014).\nBoth the Longgang and Nangrim Blocks consist of Archean basement rocks, which are as old as \u223c3.8\u00a0Ga in the Longgang Block (Song et al., 1996). While it has been suggested that the two blocks were amalgamated at \u223c1.9\u00a0Ga from south-dipping subduction of the Longgang Block under the Nangrim Block (Li and Chen, 2014), the general consensus is that the Archean basement rifted between \u223c2.3 and 1.9\u00a0Ga to form the two blocks, which were subsequently amalgamated in the Paleoproterozoic to form the JLJB at \u223c1.9\u00a0Ga (Liu et al., 1997; Luo et al., 2004, 2008; Li et al., 2006, 2011). Later compression occurred in the Permo-Triassic, affecting the margins of the NCB as a result of ocean closures and convergence with terranes of the CAOB to the north and the South China Craton (SCC) to the south (Hacker et al., 2006; Windley et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Zhai and Santosh, 2013). This was followed by initiation of subduction of the Izanagi (or Paleo-Pacific) plate from the east at \u223c170\u00a0Ma (Seton et al., 2012), which in China defines the start of the Yanshanian orogeny. Compression occurred until \u223c145\u00a0Ma, which was followed by large-scale extension and basin development during Early Cretaceous slab rollback (Dong et al., 2018).\nThe JLJB trends northeast, is 50\u2013300\u00a0km wide, and extends for more than 1,000\u00a0km from Shandong Province to North Korea (Luo et al., 2004, 2008; Zhao et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2011). The belt is fault-bounded on both sides (Fig. 1) and consists of Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks that have been metamorphosed from greenschist to amphibolite facies (Luo et al., 2004, 2008). The JLJB has been divided into northern and southern parts, which contain similar lithologies that are likely derived from the same original continental block separated by rifting. In the rift-basin model, sedimentation during rifting resulted in deposition of Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks cropping out extensively in present-day southern Jilin Province (Li et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2004, 2008; Tam et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012; Li and Chen, 2014).\nThe Hunjiang basin, which is the focus of this study, is situated in the northern part of the JLJB (Fig. 1). The geology of the basin is comparably poorly understood. It is currently not well established how sedimentary rocks occurring in the basin correlate with those in other parts of the JLJB. Field investigations during this study suggest that the oldest sedimentary rocks within the Hunjiang basin were deposited after the amalgamation of the Longgang and Nangrim Blocks at \u223c1.9\u00a0Ga because they are not intruded by the 1.88\u20131.85\u00a0Ga anorogenic granitoids recognized outside the basin (Luo et al., 2008) and are not affected by earlier deformation.\n\n\n3\nMetallogenic framework\nAlthough mineral resource and reserve data, as well as production information, are not publicly available in China (Goldfarb et al., 2014), it is known that the ENCB is well endowed with many past and presently producing mining operations. Aside from fossil fuel resources, there are numerous well-described Paleozoic to Mesozoic mineral deposits and occurrences within the ENCB to the east of the Tan-Lu fault. However, most of the mineral deposits and occurrences located within the Hunjiang basin are poorly documented (Fig. 2\n).\nThe ENCB is a significant host to Au deposits, with the eastern and northern margins of the block estimated to contain >20% of China\u2019s Au endowment (Goldfarb et al., 2019). Orogenic Au deposits are the dominant deposit type and primarily occur within the Jiaodong Peninsula (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014) and Jiapigou Au belt (Miao et al., 2005). However, there are also a large number of porphyry Cu-Mo and Cu-Au deposits, skarns, and carbonate replacement base metal deposits (Ouyang et al., 2013; Leach and Song, 2019). Ouyang et al. (2013) proposed that some of the precious metal deposits in the ENCB east of the Tan-Lu fault can be classified as epithermal deposits.\nMost mineral deposits in northeastern China formed from the Permian to the Late Cretaceous, although some older magmatic-hydrothermal deposits occur in accreted Paleozoic oceanic arcs (Hao et al., 2015; Yang and Cooke, 2019). Many ore deposits, including the orogenic Au deposits of the Jiapigou belt, formed during and immediately after the diachronous closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk ocean basin to the north between the Permian and the Jurassic, which resulted in final formation of the eastern part of the CAOB (Goldfarb et al., 2021). The Early and Middle Jurassic porphyry Mo deposits located immediately north of the NCB are hosted by a series of blocks accreted to the eastern end of the CAOB prior to 250\u00a0Ma (Goldfarb et al., 2021) and, in contrast, they are speculated to be closely related to arc magmatism during subduction of the Izanagi plate beneath the eastern margin of the NCB (Fig. 2; Ouyang et al., 2013). The controls on Cretaceous extensional activity in northeastern China are controversial because of the broadly simultaneous effects of rollback of the Mongol-Okhotsk slab after earliest Cretaceous ocean closure and initiation of Izanagi plate rollback after Jurassic subduction. The general younging of magmatic activity and related ore deposits from west to east across northeast China during the first half of the Cretaceous indicates that Cretaceous ore formation in the northernmost NCB was controlled by circum-Pacific events and there was little impact due to Mongol-Okhotsk events to the north. This was the time of formation of many magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits in northeastern China (Deng et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2012), with the peak of Au mineralization occurring at 120\u201390\u00a0Ma (Sun et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014).\n\n\n4\nHunjiang basin geology\n\n4.1\nStratigraphy\nThe Hunjiang basin, \u223c50\u00a0km in width and \u223c80\u00a0km in strike, is located along the northeastern margin of the JLJB (Figs. 1, 3\n). The basin, which is composed of Proterozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks, is bounded to the west and north by uplifted Archean basement. Jurassic volcaniclastic rocks and Quaternary basalts are located to the east of the basin. To the south, the geology is not well known as the basin extends into North Korea.\nAlong the northern margin of the Hunjiang basin, the Archean basement is unconformably overlain by \u223c500\u00a0m of limestone and interbedded shale of the Linjiagou Formation of the Proterozoic Laoling Group. Conformably overlying the Linjiagou Formation is a 1\u20135\u00a0km thick succession of massive, fossiliferous, or stromatolitic dolomite of the Zhenzhumen Formation. In the southern part of the basin, the basal Linjiagou Formation is overlain by quartzite, schist, conglomerate, and limestone of the Proterozoic Dataishan Formation. Phyllite, schist, quartzite, and marble of the Huashan, Linjiang, Dalizi, Baifangzi, and Madaling formations of the upper part of the Proterozoic Laoling Group also occur in the southern part of the basin (Figs. 3, 4\n).\nAcross much of the northern part of Hunjiang basin, the top of the Zhenzhumen Formation dolomite is marked by a pronounced disconformity separating the dolomite from younger clastic rocks of the Diaoyutai Formation, which forms the base of the Qingbaikou Group. The contact is marked by the occurrence of a hematite cement-supported scalloped quartz clast-bearing breccia known as the F100 unit. This unit can be traced along strike for more than 17\u00a0km, forming a regionally extensive marker that is the host to the White Mountain deposit, which contains\u00a0greater than\u00a050 tonnes Au (Keevil, 2019), and possibly other sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits. Iron ore is extracted in several open pit mining operations located along the F100 unit.\nThe base of the Diaoyutai Formation is locally marked by the occurrence of a basal conglomerate consisting of subrounded clasts of quartz, dolomite, mudstone, and hematite-altered rocks set in a sand to pebble matrix. The conglomerate grades upward into an up to 2.5\u00a0km-thick quartz-rich, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone. A detrital zircon study by Yang et al. (2012) identified zircons as young as 1056\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022\u00a0Ma in a sample of the Diaoyutai Formation collected in southern Liaoning Province. The youngest detrital zircon grains identified in a sandstone from the Hunjiang basin were 1806\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023\u00a0Ma (Keevil, 2019).\nThe upper contact of the Diaoyutai Formation is gradational. Overlying mudstone and siltstone are assigned to the Nanfen Formation, which also is part of the Qingbaikou Group. These fine-grained sedimentary rocks have a maximum thickness of 1\u00a0km. The Nanfen Formation is overlain by Neoproterozoic limestone with interbedded siltstoneof the Qiaotou, Wanlong, Badaojiang, and Qinggouzi formations (Figs. 3, 4). These units together have a maximum stratigraphic thickness of \u223c1.5\u00a0km and form pronounced limestone cliffs in many parts of the Hunjiang basin.\nDisconformably overlying the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are lower Cambrian strata, including sandstone of the Shuidong Formation and stromatolitic limestone of the Heigouzi Formation. The overlying lower Cambrian Jianchang and Mantou formations are composed of dolomitic limestone and clastic rocks. Gypsum units within the Mantou Formation are mined in open pit operations within the western part of the Hunjiang basin (Fig. 4; Electronic Appendix 1, 2).\nOther Cambrian strata in the northern part of the basin include the limestone-dominated Zhangxia, Gushan, Chaomidian, and Fengshan formations. A Cambrian-Ordovician boundary section is present in the eastern part of the basin near Dayangcha village (Wang and Erdtmann, 1987). At this location, the upper Cambrian Fengshan Formation is overlain by the graptolite-bearing Lower Ordovician Yeli Formation, both of which are dominated by limestone and shale. Other Lower to Middle Ordovician rocks in the basin include carbonate and chert of the Liangjiashan and Majiagou formations (Figs. 3, 4). Disconformably overlying the Ordovician units are the middle Carboniferous Benxi and Taiyuan formations, which outcrop in the center of the Hunjiang basin and consist mainly of sandstone and shale. They are host to a number of coal seams that are exploited by more than one dozen coal mines (Fig. 4; Electronic Appendix 1, 2).\nMinor clastic rocks of the lower Permian to Upper Triassic Shanxi, Xiashihezi, Shangshihezi, Shiqianfeng, and Xiaohekou formations overlie the middle Carboniferous units. An angular unconformity separates the pre-Jurassic units from overlying undeformed sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks of the Yingzuilazi, Linzitou, and Shiren formations. Zircon U-Pb dating of a flat-lying volcaniclastic unit belonging to the Linzitou Formation cropping out near Shengli village (Fig. 3) yielded an age of \u223c127\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Keevil et al., 2019). Thrusting and tilting of the strata resulting in the formation of the angular unconformity may be related to the collision of the NCB with the SCC to the south and\/or the CAOB to the north (Windley et al., 2010). The youngest Mesozoic strata in the basin, including conglomerates, sandstones, and mudstones, form part of the Early Cretaceous Heiwaizi Formation.\nIn the northern part of the basin, many of the pre-Jurassic sedimentary rock units are repeated to the northwest due to NE-striking thrusts developed during Jurassic compression (Wu et al., 2019). Units along the southern margin of the basin were metamorphosed at slightly higher grades than those occurring in the north. Marbles rather than dolomite and limestone occur in the southern part of the basin, and phyllite and schist occur in stratigraphic positions dominated by mudstone and siltstone in the northern part of the basin. In the central and northern parts of the basin, widespread NW-striking normal faulting occurred during Cretaceous extension, with the faults controlling present-day topography in this mountainous portion of the Hunjiang basin. Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial, fluvial, and glacial deposits are widespread in valleys in the mountainous parts of the basin and cover much of the lowlands.\n\n\n4.2\nIgneous rocks\nThe Archean basement surrounding the basin has been intruded by the Liaoji granites, which range from 2.2\u20132.1\u00a0Ga and 1.88\u20131.85\u00a0Ga in age (Li et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2008; Tam et al., 2011; Li and Chen, 2014). Both sets of intrusions include monzogranites, granites, and alkaline syenites. The 2.2\u20132.1\u00a0Ga granitoids formed during Paleoproterozoic rifting (Luo et al., 2008) and exhibit penetrative foliation, while the 1.88\u20131.85\u00a0Ga granitoids are largely undeformed and are anorogenic in origin (Luo et al., 2008).\nAbundant Mesozoic igneous rocks occur throughout the Hunjiang basin. Yu et al. (2009) and Pei et al. (2011) showed that granitoids and felsic volcanic rocks outcropping along the far southeastern margin and within the southern part of the basin are Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous. Keevil et al. (2019) performed a comprehensive geochronological study of igneous rocks in the Hunjiang basin, where zircon U-Pb age dating revealed the existence of two broad peaks in magmatic activity at \u223c180\u2013160\u00a0Ma and \u223c140\u2013120\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n\n5\nMaterials and methods\nExtensive field work in the Hunjiang basin was conducted over two field seasons, including visits to a large number of ore deposits and occurrences (Table 1\n) involving outcrop and drill core sampling and, where possible, underground or open pit examinations. Field observations were followed by laboratory investigations on representative samples from some of the larger deposits at the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines.\nPetrographic analyses were performed on thick (\u223c60\u00a0\u00b5m) sections using an Olympus BX51 optical microscope. The fluid inclusion petrography of gangue minerals in ore samples was studied following the criteria of Goldstein and Reynolds (1994) to constrain ore formation environments. Small-scale textural and paragenetic relationships were studied using a TESCAN MIRA3 field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operated at 15\u00a0kV with a 100 nA beam current. Back-scattered electron imaging was performed using a single-crystal YAG detector. Semiquantitative mineral analyses were obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy using a Bruker XFlash 6|30 silicon drift detector.\n\n\n6\nBasement-hosted deposits\n\n6.1\nBasement-hosted Fe deposits\nThe Archean basement outcropping along the northern margin of Hunjiang basin is host to several Fe deposits exploited by open pit mining. These include the Taian deposit, located \u223c23\u00a0km west of Baishan City, and the Banshi deposit, situated \u223c10\u00a0km north-northwest of Baishan City. At the Taian deposit, ore is composed of massive fine-grained magnetite contained in granulite facies gneisses and feldspar-rich migmatite. The magnetite forms layers and pods within the host rock (Fig. 5\na). The deposit produces approximately 1.2 Mt of ore per year. At the Banshi deposit, massive magnetite is hosted by amphibolite gneiss with disseminated pyrite occuring in the magnetite lenses (Fig. 5b).\n\n\n6.2\nMagmatic Cu-Ni deposits\nThe Chibaisong magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide deposit is located immediately west of the Hunjiang basin within an Archean basement uplift. The deposit was not included in this study because a comprehensive deposit description was published by Han et al. (2014). According to these authors, the deposit is hosted by a Paleoproterozoic intrusion composed of plagioclase lherzolite and norite gabbro. The intrusion is 40\u2013140\u00a0m thick and extends for 4,800\u00a0m along strike. The massive to semi-massive and disseminated ores contain pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and violarite.\n\n\n6.3\nOrogenic Au deposits\nThe Yuejin orogenic Au deposit is located 5\u00a0km south of Tonghua in uplifted Archean basement along the western margin of the Hunjiang basin. An underground mine (Fig. 5c) exploits a vertically dipping, \u223c2 m wide Au-bearing quartz-carbonate vein and its splays hosted by gneiss, amphibolite, and carbonaceous slate. The vein system contains trace amounts of native gold in addition to pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena (Fig. 5d-f). The mine operation produces ore at an average grade of \u223c10\u00a0g\/t Au. The quartz veins at Yuejin consist of early blocky quartz containing abundant secondary fluid inclusions along healed microfractures having a wispy appearance. The quartz is crosscut by microfractures along which ribbons of pyrite have formed. Pyrite formation was associated with the recrystallization of the quartz and is crosscut by later chalcopyrite and galena (Fig. 5e, f). Minor argentite also occurs within galena, and native gold appears to be associated with the galena. Texturally late carbonate minerals form veinlets or infill vugs within quartz veins.\n\n\n\n7\nSedimentary rock-hosted deposits\n\n7.1\nSedimentary rock-hosted Co-Cu and Ni-Co-Cu deposits\nTwo sedimentary rock-hosted Co-Cu and Ni-Co-Cu deposits occur along the southern margin of the Hunjiang basin (Fig. 3). The Dahenglu Co-Cu deposit is located \u223c30\u00a0km southeast of Baishan City and \u223c30\u00a0 km southwest of Linjiang City. Dahenglu was developed as a past-producing underground mine with several adits and large waste piles remaining at the site. The main commodities mine were Co and Cu with lesser amounts of Zn and Pb produced as by-products. Regional mapping indicates that the deposit is located close to the contact between dolomite to dolomitic marble of the Proterozoic Zhenzhumen Formation and phyllite of the overlying Proterozoic Huashan Formation (Fig. 3). The stratiform orebodies of the Dahenglu deposit are \u223c10\u201335\u00a0m thick, 360\u20131,400\u00a0m long, and are largely hosted by micaceous phyllite (Feng and Zhang, 2004). Feng and Zhang (2004) reported Co grades of 0.035\u20130.080\u00a0wt%. Waste dump material contains abundant sulfide-bearing quartz-carbonate veinlets that are up to 5\u00a0cm in thickness. The predominant ore mineral is cobaltoan pyrite (Fig. 6\na, b), with lesser amounts of cobaltite (Fig. 6c), Co\u2013 and Ni-bearing pyrite, chalcopyrite (Fig. 6b, d), siegenite, galena, and sphalerite. Oxidized samples contain malachite along fracture surfaces.\nThe Shansonggang Ni-Co-Cu deposit is located \u223c25\u00a0km southeast of Baishan City and \u223c15\u00a0km west of Linjiang City. Shansonggang is \u223c20\u00a0km to the northeast of Dahenglu, within the same stratigraphic position close to the contact between the Proterozoic Zhenzhumen Formation and phyllite and marble of the overlying Proterozoic Huashan Formation. The deposit was mined by a state-owned Chinese company until closure in 2005. Three adits and some former mine infrastructure remain at the site. Outcrops at the mine property include marble of the Huashan Formation and Jurassic granitoids. Ore of the Shansonggang deposit is comprised of small sulfide lenses and mineralized quartz-carbonate veins. The most common ore minerals include maucherite and pentlandite (Fig. 6e, f), with gersdorffite commonly rimming the pentlandite grains (Fig. 6g). In addition, millerite, chalcopyrite, and bornite have been identified, with chalcopyrite and bornite commonly being intergrown (Fig. 6h). Talnakhite forms exsolution lamellae in pentlandite. Radiating crystals of tremolite crosscut ore minerals and veins (Fig. 6f). Oxidized samples from the waste dumps contain annabergite and erythrite.\n\n\n7.2\nSedimentary rock-hosted Fe deposits\nThe F100 unit, located at the disconformity between the Proterozoic Zhenzhumen Formation and the overlying Diaoyutai Formation in the northern part of Hunjiang basin, is host to several sedimentary rock-hosted Fe deposits, including the Ma\u2019angang deposit. The ore at this deposit consists of hematite cement-supported quartz clast-bearing breccia (Fig. 7\na). A narrow zone within this breccia showed elevated Au grades of \u223c1\u20132\u00a0g\/t (Eldorado Gold Corp., unpublished data). The dolomite in the immediate footwall to this breccia unit is stromatolitic and contains abundant quartz clasts that are scalloped, forming ribbon-like bands (Fig. 7b).\nThe Yuanbaodingzi Fe deposit is located \u223c17\u00a0km west of Baishan City along the same stratigraphic interval as Ma\u2019angang. Outcrops of the Zhenzhumen Formation in the open pit consist of massive dolomite overlain by stromatolitic dolomite, followed by dolomite containing abundant contorted bands of quartz (Fig. 7c). The ore at Yuanbaodingzi also consists of hematite cement-supported quartz clast-bearing breccia. Immediately beneath the brecciated contact, the dolomite exhibits high porosity, likely from dissolution of evaporites (Warren, 2016).\nSeveral small Fe deposits within the F100 unit are exploited by artisanal miners, such as the hematite cement-supported quartz clast-rich breccia mined at the Xinmintun deposit (Fig. 7d). The outcrops viewed at this deposit demonstrate a progression from unaltered, commonly stromatolitic dolomite, to dolomite with layers replaced by microcrystalline quartz, to the hematite cement-supported quartz clast-bearing breccia.\nThin section microscopy showed that quartz clasts within the brecciated unit at all sedimentary Fe deposits examined are recrystallized. The quartz grains are crosscut by healed microfractures defined by secondary fluid inclusions forming wispy arrays.\n\n\n\n8\nMagmatic-hydrothermal deposits\n\n8.1\nPorphyry Cu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Au\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Mo deposits\nThe Liudaojiang porphyry Cu-Au deposit is located \u223c9\u00a0km southwest of Baishan City and is hosted by a porphyritic granodiorite. The deposit was developed by a past producing underground mine. Porphyry and associated skarn mineralization are associated with an intrusive center emplaced into Cambrian to Ordovician limestone. Porphyry ores comprise stockwork veins (Fig. 8\na,b) and disseminated sulfides (Fig. 8b). Paragenetically earliest are A-type veins that consist of gray quartz that is anhedral under the microscope. Early quartz contains abundant assemblages of coexisting hypersaline liquid-rich and vapor-rich fluid inclusions (Fig. 8c). The ore minerals contained in the stockwork formed subsequent to the quartz. Chalcopyrite and pyrite form coatings on fractures transecting the wall rock and the earlier quartz veins (Fig. 8d). Late veins are observed within the host granodiorite that consist of euhedral quartz with pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and minor galena. Latest calcite veinlets crosscut all earlier stockwork veins.\nThe March 5 Youth porphyry Cu-Mo deposit is located in Chagang Province in North Korea, \u223c13\u00a0km southwest of the Chinese border city of Linjiang. The open pit mine, situated in a bend of the Yalu River bordering China and North Korea, has been intermittently mined for Cu since the 1960s. A Mo processing facility was constructed between 2008 and 2014. Although the mine operation could not be visited, the open pit and mine infrastructure adjacent to the mining town of Hoha-ri (Fig. 9\na, b) can be observed from the Chinese side of the Yalu River and from satellite images (Fig. 9c), and a hand sample of ore from the deposit was provided by the Jilin Nonferrous Geological Bureau (Fig. 9d). The ore is hosted in a potassically-altered porphyritic rock containing quartz and feldspar phenocrysts with minor secondary biotite set in a fine-grained groundmass. Tabular feldspar phenocrysts are up to 7\u00a0mm in diameter. Molybdenite is hosted in thin AB-type stockwork veins containing gray quartz, with small euhedral quartz crystals forming a central vug. Textural relationships suggest that the molybdenite formed with or after the euhedral quartz crystals.\nThe Ermi porphyry Cu deposit is located along the far western margin of the Hunjiang basin, \u223c16\u00a0km northeast of Tonghua (Fig. 3). The underground mine is owned and operated by Tonghua Hengbang Mining Ltd. The mineral resource is exploited by an underground mining operation to \u223c200\u00a0m below surface from two adits. The Ermi deposit formed in association with a Late Cretaceous intrusive center emplaced into Early Cretaceous intermediate volcanic rocks (Chen et al., 2008). The host diorite is composed of plagioclase, quartz, and biotite phenocrysts set in a fine-grained groundmass of quartz and feldspar (Fig. 9e). Ore grades in the porphyry range from 0.4 to 1.0% Cu (Zhang et al., 2015). The earliest quartz veins at the Ermi deposit are A-type veins associated with potassic alteration of the wall rocks. Some of these veins were reopened during subsequent evolution of the magmatic-hydrothermal system. In some cases, reopening resulted in the formation of euhedral quartz crystals that grew perpendicular to vein walls, allowing these veins to be classified as AB-type veins. The early quartz contains abundant intermediate-density fluid inclusions (Fig. 9f). Many of the primary and secondary fluid inclusions have been affected by post-entrapment modification, rendering them unsuitable for the measurement of homogenization temperatures. In addition to A-type and AB-type veins (Fig. 9g), C-type veins are common at Ermi that consist of chalcopyrite and pyrite, commonly with little or no quartz gangue. In many cases, the C veins only form sulfide-coated fractures in the diorite. Some of the quartz veins contain late arsenopyrite with inclusions of bismuth tellurides (Fig. 9h) and pyrargyrite. These sulfide minerals are associated with euhedral quartz that exhibits oscillatory growth zoning. The paragenetically latest veinlets consist of calcite and Fe-bearing carbonate.\nSeveral other porphyry deposits are located just outside of the basin but were not visited during this study. On the north side of the basin, the Changfagou Cu porphyry is hosted by Archean basement rocks (Zhang et al., 2015). The Hyesan Cu porphyry and skarn deposit, North Korea\u2019s largest Cu deposit, is located east of Linjiang City (Zhang et al., 2019). Mining was initiated in 1970 and continued until flooding in 1994. Underground mining resumed in 2010. Combined estimated resources for the porphyry and skarn deposits include 160 million tonnes of 1.5% Cu, 3.2% Pb, 3.6% Zn, 0.6\u00a0g\/t Au, and 180\u00a0g\/t Ag (Korea North Mining Laws and Regulations Handbooks, 2017). The Unhung and associated Kapsan Cu porphyry deposits are located in close proximity to Hyesan in North Korea (Sun, 1994; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\n\n8.2\nCu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Mo skarn deposits\nThe Linjiang Cu-Mo skarn is located southeast of Linjiang City along the southeastern margin of the Hunjiang basin, outside the limits of Fig. 3, and was not visited during this study. Zhang et al. (2015) reported that the host rocks of the skarn deposit are schists and marbles of the Zhenzhumen Formation, which were intruded by diorite, quartz diorite, granodiorite, dacite porphyry, and granite porphyry. Chalcopyrite is the dominant ore mineral contained in the skarn, which contains garnet, diopside, and tremolite as gangue minerals. The mineralized zone is \u223c500\u00a0m long, 200\u00a0m wide, and up to 400\u00a0m in depth (Zhang et al., 2015).\nSkarn mineralization at the Liudaojiang porphyry deposit consists of Cu mineralization within the marble wall rock hosting the intrusive center. The skarn zones contain abundant chalcopyrite, chalcocite, and minor malachite (Fig. 10\na, b) with grades up to 7% Cu. The dominant ore mineral is chalcopyrite, which forms semi-massive clots in the host marble (Fig. 10c). Galena and sphalerite are also common in the Liudaojiang skarn (Fig. 10b, d). Gangue minerals in the skarn could not be observed because mineralization was only located in ore piles near the main adit at the past-producing mine site. It is likely that most of the underground production was from the higher grade skarn mineralization rather than the Liudaojiang porphyry deposit itself.\n\n\n8.3\nGold skarn deposits\nThe Nancha Au deposit is located \u223c38\u00a0km south of Baishan City and \u223c27\u00a0km southeast of Tonghua (Fig. 3). The deposit is hosted in Proterozoic marble and interbedded schist of the Huashan Formation. It was mined underground by the state-owned Tonghua County Gold Mine before being bought out by a private company. The underground mine is now closed, but some infrastructure remains at the site. The skarn deposit is hosted by marble of the Zhenzhumen Formation and phyllite of the overlying Huashan Formation. The deposit was mined at an average grade of 6.59\u00a0g\/t Au (Chai et al., 2016). In hand sample, the ore from the Nancha deposit contains brown garnet with late pyrite and arsenopyrite replacing marble bands within schist (Fig. 10e). Chlorite and serpentine are common along fracture surfaces. Skarn formation may have been related to a diorite intrusion, as indicated by the abundance of igneous rock in the waste dumps containing feldspar phenocrysts and biotite set in a fine-grained groundmass.\nMicroscopically, ore samples contain garnet grains that are up to 2\u00a0cm in diameter and compositionally range from spessartine to andradite. Other skarn minerals include diopside, humite series minerals, phlogopite, and tremolite. Sulfide minerals are paragenetically late and formed during a retrograde event overprinting earlier skarn minerals (Fig. 10f). The predominant sulfide minerals are pyrite and arsenopyrite (Fig. 10g) with lesser chalcopyrite. Arsenopyrite contains inclusions of l\u00f6llingite and unidentified small bismuth-bearing oxide phases (Fig. 10h). Hessite is also present. According to Chai et al. (2016), Au occurs as native gold. Late chlorite and serpentine are present and may have formed during the retrograde ore event.\n\n\n8.4\nIron skarn deposits\nThe Weishahe Fe skarn is the site of a past producing underground mine located \u223c16\u00a0km southwest of Linjiang City and 37\u00a0km southeast of Baishan City, near the North Korea border (Fig. 3). The orebody comprises massive magnetite and hematite replacing Proterozoic marble of the Qingbaikou Group (Fig. 11\na). Pyrite, sphalerite, and minor galena occur as veins and disseminations that appear to be paragenetically later than the magnetite or occur as replacement zones in the marble. Pyrite contains rare inclusions of arsenopyrite. Late scapolite veins are abundant and cut through the Fe oxides (Fig. 11b). Although magnetite and hematite are the main ore minerals historically mined, current exploration by Team 602 of the Jilin Nonferrous Metal Geological Exploration Bureau focuses primarily on zones of elevated base metal grades.\nThe Xiaolizi Fe skarn is developed by an active underground mine owned by the same company as Weishahe and is located \u223c2\u00a0km to the east within the same Proterozoic marble of the Qingbaikou Group, interbedded with phyllite (Fig. 3). The mine has been in operation for more than 30\u00a0years and currently employs \u223c300 miners. Approximately 55,000 tonnes of Fe ore are mined per year, and the total resource is stated as 16 million tonnes Fe ore at grades of 44\u201345% FeO. The ore consists of massive magnetite with semi-massive pods and stringers of pyrite (Fig. 11c). Late siderite veinlets cut the magnetite and are themselves cut by paragenetically latest quartz-K-feldspar veinlets (Fig. 11d). Where hematite is observed, it occurs with scapolite or siderite.\nSeveral other Fe skarns have been recognized in the Hunjiang basin. The Qidaogou deposit is a magnetite-dominant Fe skarn located \u223c40\u00a0km southeast of the city of Tonghua and 45\u00a0km south-southwest of Baishan City (Fig. 3). The deposit was initially mined during Japanese occupation of this part of Jilin Province in the 1940s but is currently owned and operated by the state-owned Qidaogou Iron Mining Company. The Qidaogou deposit is developed by more than 50 adits, with ore processing taking place on site. Ore is hosted in marble to dolomitic marble with interbedded phyllite of the Proterozoic Dalizi Formation. Magnetite is the predominant ore mineral and is massive to disseminated, replacing the host marble. Hematite is less common but can be intergrown with magnetite (Fig. 11e). Ore samples contain abundant garnet and paragenetically late pyrite and calcite cement. Minor sphalerite and chalcopyrite are present. Scapolite veins crosscut the magnetite ore and are crosscut by paragenetically later calcite veins (Fig. 11f).\nThe Erdaohezi deposit is located adjacent to Qidaogou and is operated as an open pit mine by a private company. The magnetite-dominant skarn is hosted within marble to dolomitic marble of the Proterozoic Dalizi Formation (Fig. 11g). Mafic dikes that are up to \u223c1.5\u00a0m wide are located within the open pit and are associated with halos of light green calc-silicate alteration within the surrounding marble. No felsic intrusion was observed in outcrop but altered porphyritic material with feldspar phenocrysts set in a blue-gray groundmass is present in the waste piles. Scapolite veins crosscut the magnetite and paragenetically late serpentine is present in the dolomitic host rock (Fig. 11h).\n\n\n8.5\nFe-B skarn deposits\nThe Gaotaigou Fe-B skarn deposit is located along the western margin of the Hunjiang basin, \u223c45\u00a0km south-southwest of Tonghua. The deposit is exploited by an active underground mine served through one adit. Mineralization at Gaotaigou is hosted by Proterozoic dolomitic marble that has been intruded by fine-grained microgranite. The ore occurs as layers of massive magnetite and serpentine, and centimeter-wide veins and replacement zones of suanite (Mg2B2O5) are common (Fig. 12\na-d). The serpentine has a granular texture and appears to have formed through retrograde replacement of an earlier Mg-bearing skarn mineral (Fig. 12b). Disseminated pyrite is locally present in the massive magnetite and serpentine layers. Suanite is commonly associated with ludwigite [(Mg2Fe3+(BO3)O2] and szaibelyite [MgBO2(OH)].\nThe Huanziyao Fe-B skarn is located \u223c4\u00a0km northwest of the Gaotaigou deposit and is hosted by the same Proterozoic dolomitic marble unit. The skarn is exploited by a small underground mining operation. The orebody comprises magnetite and serpentine layers developed within the dolomitic marble (Fig. 12e-h). Disseminated pyrite is present in the magnetite-rich and serpentine-rich orebody. Paragenetically late chrysotile veinlets are up to several centimeters wide (Fig. 12g). Abundant ludwigite is present.\n\n\n8.6\nCarbonate replacement deposits\nThe Huanggoushan Zn-Pb carbonate replacement deposit is located \u223c25\u00a0km southeast of Baishan City and 20\u00a0km west of Linjiang City. Discovered in 1959, the deposit was exploited by underground mining by the Linjiang Company. Mining operations ceased more than ten years ago. According to Wang et al. (2020), the deposit contains a remaining reserve of 110,000\u00a0t of Zn and 18,000\u00a0t of Pb at average grades of 9.08% Zn and 1.22% Pb. The orebody at the Huanggoushan deposit is hosted by dolomitic marble of the Zhenzhumen Formation. The ore comprises massive sulfides underlain by an extensive stockwork zone (Wang et al., 2020). Banding of the massive sulfide ores is common at the hand specimen scale (Fig. 13\na). Sphalerite and pyrite are the principal ore minerals, with much less abundant galena (Fig. 13b-d). Arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite are both common as inclusions in pyrite. Chalcopyrite occurs in trace concentrations. Talc is a common gangue mineral (Fig. 13d).\nThe Yinzigou Zn-Pb deposit was developed by a past producing underground mine located \u223c2\u00a0km west of the Huanggoushan deposit. The carbonate replacement deposit is hosted by Proterozoic dolomitic marble of the Zhenzhumen Formation. The ore primarily consists of breccia comprising dolomitic marble clasts that are up to 5\u00a0cm in diameter and range from subrounded to subangular. The clasts are cemented by honey-brown sphalerite and minor galena (Fig. 13e, f). Arsenopyrite is a trace mineral. The cement also contains talc as a gangue mineral (Fig. 13g). Supergene oxidation resulted in the formation of smithsonite, par\u00e1dsasv\u00e1rite, and cerussite (Fig. 13f,h).\n\n\n\n9\nDistal sedimentary rock-hosted Au and Sb deposits\n\nWhite Mountain is the most important distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposit in Hunjiang basin, with a total endowment of 53 tonnes Au. The deposit is located \u223c6\u00a0km northwest of Baishan City and was owned and operated as an underground mine by Eldorado Gold Corp. until 2016, when it was sold to a subsidiary of Yintai Resources Co. Gold mineralization is largely stratabound and occurs in breccia developed along the F100 unit, which forms the stratigraphic top of the Proterozoic dolomite of the Zhenzhumen Formation and is disconformably overlain by conglomerate and sandstone of the Diaoyutai Formation.\nThe White Mountain deposit is paragenetically complex due to multiple episodes of pre-, syn-, and post-ore brecciation. Pre-ore brecciation of the hematite-rich F100 unit resulted in ground preparation, whereas post-ore brecciation occurs as karst fill and dissolution breccias in the footwall dolomite of the Zhenzhumen Formation. Native gold occurs as micron-sized grains within fractures in semi-massive, commonly oxidized marcasite cement in brecciated host rock (Fig. 14\na, b) or in hydrothermal breccias that are oxidized and contain cement of hydrothermal quartz, barite, and hematite (Fig. 14c, d). Arsenopyrite, coloradoite, and hessite are other common ore-stage minerals. Hydrothermal quartz within the ore breccias contains assemblages of necked primary fluid inclusions that show irregular shapes and have inconsistent liquid to vapor ratios indicating low (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) formation temperatures.\nThe Xiaoshiren Au prospect, located \u223c13\u00a0km southeast of Baishan City and 20\u00a0km southeast of the White Mountain deposit, is hosted in silicified dolomitic marble that is hydrothermally brecciated (Fig. 14e). Hematite commonly forms both cement and clasts of the breccias. Micron-scale native gold occurs in association with Fe oxides that have formed by surface oxidation of hypogene pyrite and\/or marcasite (Fig. 14f). Gold occurs as native gold (Fig. 14g), commonly within fractures in Fe oxides (Fig. 14h). Trace amounts of chalcopyrite and galena occur in samples not intensely oxidized. The hematitic ores at Xiaoshiren are cut by a dike of intermediate composition that is also mineralized and grades up to 3\u00a0g\/t Au. Hydrothermal quartz contains primary fluid inclusions exhibiting variable liquid to vapor ratios and were entrapped at temperatures\u00a0<200\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe Fuxingcun Au deposit is located \u223c5\u00a0km east of the Nancha Au skarn. The deposit is developed by an underground mine through an adit hosted by limestone and produces Au with Ag, Cu, and Fe being mined as by-products. The mineralization is hosted by dark blue to gray limestone with local dolomite along a fault zone that separates Proterozoic carbonate rocks of the Dataishan Formation from Paleozoic limestone and sandstone of the Yeli Formation (Fig. 3). The ores contain abundant pyrite veinlets as well as veins composed of quartz, dolomite, and Fe-bearing carbonates (Fig. 15\na). Semi-massive to massive pyrite and marcasite are present (Fig. 15b), with trace amounts of galena and chalcopyrite that have been observed microscopically (Fig. 15c). Barite infills fractures or open spaces in the veinlets or in vugs in the carbonate host rocks (Fig. 15d). Wang et al. (2008) reported that Au occurs primarily as native gold.\nThe Shijiapuzi deposit is located \u223c5\u00a0km south of Tonghua. An active underground mine at the deposit is owned and operated by the Tonghua Yuejin Gold Mine Company, which also operates the Yuejin orogenic Au deposit located 2\u00a0km to the southwest. The deposit is developed by two adits and one shaft that extends to 90\u00a0m depth. Gold mineralization is hosted by a subvertically dipping fault zone within Proterozoic marble and interbedded phyllite of the Zhenzhumen Formation. Most of the production at the mine is derived from limonitic ore formed by supergene oxidation of pyrite originally contained in the marble and interbedded phyllite (Fig. 15e). Samples that have not been affected by intense oxidation contain pyrite and minor amounts of disseminated chalcopyrite (Fig. 15f). Chalcopyrite is also present as inclusions in pyrite (Fig. 15g, h) within the quartz and K-feldspar-rich groundmass. Pyrite veins locally cross-cut foliation, indicating that mineralization postdated foliation development. Pyrite contains\u00a0<5\u00a0\u00b5m sized inclusions of hessite and petzite (Fig. 15g, h).\nThe Liujiapuzi-Langdonggou Au-Ag deposit is developed by a small past-producing mining operation located \u223c7\u00a0km SSW of Baishan City and\u00a0<10\u00a0km south of the White Mountain Au deposit (Fig. 3). The deposit is hosted by rhyolite that intruded into Cambrian limestone. The flow-banded rhyolite is brecciated and has been affected by argillic alteration. Quartz and sulfide occur as cements in the rhyolite breccia or form veins crosscutting the rhyolite (Fig. 16\na). Sulfide minerals include pyrite, sphalerite, galena, bornite, and chalcopyrite (Fig. 16b). The sphalerite contains inclusions of altaite (Fig. 16c), hessite, and petzite (Fig. 16d). The euhedral quartz that occurs in veins with the sulfide minerals contains small (<5 \u00b5m long), necked fluid inclusions that exhibit inconsistent liquid to vapor ratios suggestive of low (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) formation temperatures.\n\nGangou is an exploration project located \u223c24\u00a0km west of Baishan City (Fig. 3). It is hosted in phosphorus-rich sandy interbeds within Proterozoic dolomite of the Zhenzhumen Formation. The exploration project comprises several exploration pits that expose oxidized, gossanous breccias (Fig. 16e). Abundant small quartz veinlets occur in the intensely oxidized and brecciated material (Fig. 16f, g). Euhedral quartz crystals in the veinlets only contain rare fluid inclusions, which are variably shaped and have inconsistent liquid to vapor ratios. The petrographic characteristics suggest that the quartz formed at low (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) temperatures and that the fluid inclusions have been affected by necking. Spaces between the euhedral quartz crystals are infilled by hematite (Fig. 16h). Hematite also forms a common cement in the brecciated gossanous material.\nThe Nadapo sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposit is developed by a large active underground mine located \u223c19\u00a0km WSW of Linjiang City, near the North Korea border (Fig. 3). The mine is owned and operated by the Linjiang Company and is accessed through one shaft. The deposit has a reserve of 15\u00a0t Au at an average grade of 7.2\u00a0g\/t Au and produces Ag as a by-product (Wang et al., 2020). Mineralization is hosted along the contact between hematite-stained dolomitic marble of the Proterozoic Zhenzhumen Formation and phyllite of the Huashan Formation. Early quartz veins contain abundant arsenopyrite. Within the ore zones, the host dolomitic marble is typically brecciated, with the clasts being cemented by fine-grained pyrite (Fig. 17\na). Laminated sulfide veins are also common in the ore zone (Fig. 17b). Arsenopyrite is common (Fig. 17c) and both coloradoite and hessite (Fig. 17d) were recognized microscopically. Paragenetically late stibnite and chalcostibnite occur in the cement between the dolomitic marble clasts and within the sulfide veins. The hydrothermal quartz contains necked, low-temperature fluid inclusions similar to those observed in the other sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits of the basin.\nThe Qinggouzi Sb deposit is a past producing mine located \u223c7\u00a0km northwest of Linjiang City near the North Korea border. The deposit is hosted by mica schists of the Proterozoic Huashan Formation. The schists contain disseminated arsenopyrite, which is commonly intergrown with pyrite (Fig. 17e). Arsenopyrite also occurs with pyrite in quartz veins that are up to 4\u00a0cm thick. Some quartz veins contain euhedral quartz growing into open spaces, with the vugs being infilled by stibnite (Fig. 17f, g) or p\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nenite (Fig. 17h). Arsenolite (As4O6) is common in samples affected by supergene overprinting of the sulfide minerals (Fig. 17h).\n\n\n10\nDiscussion of deposit timing and genetic implications\nThe field and laboratory investigations conducted as part of this study allow a classification of the various mineral deposits located in the Hunjiang basin. Archean basement rocks outcropping to the north of the basin and within an uplifted block in the southeastern part of the basin host magnetite-dominant Fe deposits, magmatic Cu-Ni, and orogenic Au deposits. Metamorphosed Co-Cu and Ni-Co-Cu deposits occur in Proterozoic rocks in the southern part of the Hunjiang basin. Mesozoic igneous activity was associated with the formation of a range of magmatic-hydrothermal deposit types, including porphyry, skarn, and Zn-Pb carbonate replacement deposits. Economically most significant are Au deposits within the basin that are related to the porphyry emplacement but formed in distal positions to the intrusive centers.\n\n10.1\nPrecambrian ore deposits in the Hunjiang basin\n\n10.1.1\nBasement-hosted deposits\nThe basement-hosted Taian and Banshi magnetite deposits occur in Archean gneiss that experienced granulite-facies peak metamorphism. These deposits have been previously classified as syngenetic banded Fe formation ores (Li et al., 2014). The relationships described above suggest that this interpretation must be viewed with caution. Although the protolith of the Archean gneiss may be sedimentary, layering at Taian and Banshi may at least in part be a result of partial melting of the protolith. Processes involved in the formation of these magnetite deposits may have been similar to those of the New Jersey Highlands in the United States, where magnetite formed during metamorphic decarbonation of siliceous siderite layers in the sedimentary host rocks (Kastelic, 1980). Such high-grade metamorphism of the Archean basement to the Hunjiang basin must have occurred prior to the deposition of the Proterozoic Linjiagou Formation, which unconformably overlies the basement rocks (Fig. 4).\nThe Chibaisong magmatic Cu-Ni deposit, which was not visited as part of this study, is a mafic\u2013ultramafic intrusion located in the uplifted Archean basement to the west of the Hunjiang basin (Fig. 3). Deposit formation occurred at 1885\u00a0\u00b1\u00a094\u00a0Ma as suggested by a Re-Os isochron age obtained on sulfide minerals (Han et al., 2014). This post-dates mafic dike emplacement in the deposit area at 2188\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 and 2145\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0Ma that likely correlates with the onset of rifting in the Hunjiang basin region (Han et al., 2014). As basin closure occurred at 1.93\u20131.90\u00a0Ga (thus also prior to ore formation), Han et al. (2014) suggested that the Chibaisong deposit formed during a post-orogenic extensional event along the eastern margin of the ENCB.\nThe Yuejin orogenic Au deposit is hosted by amphibolite facies Archean gneiss (Wang et al., 2018) outcropping near the western margin of the Hunjiang basin (Fig. 3). Orogenic Au deposits commonly form during regional metamorphism of the host terranes, with Au-bearing fluids derived from metamorphic devolatilization (Goldfarb et al., 2001, 2005, 2007). The timing of formation of the Yuejin deposit is unknown. Gold mineralization could have occurred at \u223c2.5\u00a0Ga during metamorphism of the ENCB or during rift closure that created the JLJB at \u223c1.9\u00a0Ga. However, because there are no significant Precambrian Au deposits in northeastern China (Goldfarb et al., 2019), it is also possible that this poorly studied and undated deposit is Mesozoic in age. The world-class orogenic Au deposits of the Jiaodong and Liaodong Peninsulas, which are located in the JLJB \u223c500\u00a0km to the southwest of the Hunjiang basin, are Early Cretaceous and are thought to have formed as part of a complex episode of Izanagi slab subduction and regional extension (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014; Goldfarb et al., 2019). Deposits of the Jiapigou Au belt \u223c100\u00a0km to the northeast of the Hunjiang basin have been dated as Triassic (Miao et al., 2005) to Cretaceous (Deng et al., 2014).\n\n\n10.1.2\nSedimentary rock-hosted Co-Cu and Ni-Co-Cu deposits\nThe Dahenglu Co-Cu and Shansonggang Ni-Co-Cu deposits situated along the southern margin of Hunjiang basin are hosted by sedimentary rocks and appear to have been overprinted by greenschist facies metamorphism. The deposits are hosted along the NE-striking contact between the Huashan and Zhenzhumen formations, which forms the Nancha-Huanggoushan-Xiaosiping brittle-ductile shear zone (Chai et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). Although undated, these stratiform and discordant ores are likely Proterozoic in age.\nExisting information is too limited to adequately classify these small deposits. The Dahenglu deposit may have formed by processes comparable to those responsible for the formation of the Cu-Co deposits of the Central African copper belt (Feng and Zhang, 2004). The metamorphic fabric in the host phyllite is deflected by the veins and wraps around disseminated ore mineral grains (Fig. 6d), indicating that ore formation was pre- to syn-metamorphism. Based on the study of mineralized quartz veins, Chai et al. (2016) concluded that Dahenglu formed from deeply sourced fluids that interacted with organic-rich sedimentary rocks. Alternatively, it is possible that Dahenglu is a metamorphosed black shale-type deposit similar to the Ni-Cu-Co-Zn ores at the Talvivaara deposit in Finland (Loukola-Ruskeeniemi and Lahtinen, 2013) and in south China (Pa\u0161ava et al., 2008). The Shansonggang deposit is situated along the same NE-striking contact as Dahenglu, within Proterozoic schist and interbedded marble interpreted to be part of the Huashan Formation (Fig. 3). The orebody shows similar characteristics to Dahenglu and may also be pre- to syn-metamorphic in origin. The mineralization is distinctly enriched in Ni, which is consistent with the metamorphosed black shale model.\n\n\n\n10.2\nJurassic-Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal deposits\n\n10.2.1\nPorphyry deposits\nSeveral porphyry deposits occur in the Hunjiang basin region that have formed in association with Mesozoic igneous activity. The Middle Jurassic Liudaojiang deposit is associated with the oldest porphyry intrusion. Unmineralized quartz monzonite from this deposit yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 167\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma and a mineralized granodiorite was dated at 166\u00a0Ma\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 (Keevil et al., 2019).\nMuch of the porphyry mineralization in the basin is Early Cretaceous in age. No age constraints are available for the March 5 Youth deposit in North Korea. However, an age of 129.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma was obtained for the granodiorite from the Linjiang skarn deposit on the Chinese side of the border (Zhang et al., 2018) and a porphyritic granodiorite cropping out immediately across the Yalu River from the March 5 Youth deposit on the Chinese side of the border yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 128\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Keevil et al., 2019). The Hyesan porphyry and skarn deposits in North Korea are reported to be associated with a \u223c127\u00a0Ma intrusive complex (Sun, 1994). The Changfagou porphyry on the north side of the basin is associated with an intrusive center dated at 117.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2015).\nThe Ermi deposit in the western Hunjiang basin is associated with one of the youngest porphyry intrusions and is Late Cretaceous in age. A pre-ore granite porphyry has been dated at 96.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2015). Diorite associated with the porphyry mineralization yielded a U-Pb age of 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (Keevil et al., 2019).\n\n\n10.2.2\nSkarn and carbonate replacement deposits\nThe skarn deposits of the Hunjiang basin formed as a result of the emplacement of Mesozoic porphyry intrusions into the Proterozoic dolomite and limestone rocks of the basin. The skarn deposits are all located proximal to major porphyritic intrusions. Although only a few dates are available, the skarn and replacement deposits in Hunjiang basin also appear to be both late Early to Middle Jurassic and middle Early Cretaceous in age.\nThe Nancha Au skarn deposit is located within 3\u00a0km of a Mesozoic porphyritic granite intrusion (Fig. 3). Chai et al. (2016) reported a 40Ar\/39Ar age of 170.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0Ma for hydrothermal sericite associated with an auriferous quartz vein. The Weishahe and Xiaolizi Fe skarn deposits are situated proximal (<3 km) to the March 5 Youth porphyry deposit, which is interpreted to be Early Cretaceous in age (Keevil et al., 2019). The Erdaohezi and Qidaogou Fe skarn deposits are both within 5\u00a0km of Nancha, and both are also within 5\u00a0km of the Mesozoic intrusions. The Gaotaigou and Huanziyao Fe-B skarns in the western part of the Hunjiang basin are hosted in dolomitic marble adjacent to a Mesozoic intrusive center (Fig. 3). Both skarn deposits are mineralogically distinct from the Fe skarns in the basin, presumably because they formed in sedimentary host rocks containing evaporites allowing the formation of B-bearing skarn mineral assemblages (Peng et al., 1998).\n\nKeevil et al. (2019) suggested that the Liudaojiang Cu skarn is Middle Jurassic as it is associated with a porphyry dated at 166\u00a0Ma\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01. The Linjiang Cu-Mo skarn located southeast of Linjiang City along the southeastern margin of Hunjiang basin is Early Cretaceous in age. Zircon separated from a granodiorite sample yielded a U-Pb age of 129.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2015) reported a similar Re\u2013Os molybdenite isochron age of 129.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma for the skarn.\nThe Huanggoushan and Yinzigou Zn-Pb deposits do not contain high-temperature calc-silicate minerals and are classified as carbonate replacement deposits. Leach and Song (2019) suggested that many carbonate replacement deposits in the NCB have previously been misclassified as skarns. Both Huanggoushan and Yinzigou are situated along a NE-SW-striking shear zone that may have controlled fluid flow originating from an adjacent biotite granite, which has been dated at 178.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma (Wang et al., 2020).\n\n\n10.2.3\nDepth of formation of porphyry-skarn systems and epithermal ore potential\n\nKeevil (2019) surveyed the fluid inclusion petrography in quartz vein samples from the porphyry deposits of the Hunjiang basin to constrain the depth of deposit formation below the paleosurface. This provided critical information on the level of erosion and possible relationships between the porphyry deposits and other ore deposits in the basin.\nEarly A-type veins from the Middle Jurassic Liudaojiang porphyry deposit contain abundant hypersaline liquid-rich and vapor-rich fluid inclusions (Fig. 8c). This petrographic observation suggests that Liudaojiang is an intermediate-depth porphyry system emplaced between \u223c1.5 and 4.2\u00a0km below the paleosurface because the two-phase conditions for an H2O-NaCl magmatic-hydrothermal system at lithostatic conditions would correspond to this depth range (Monecke et al., 2018).\nThis contrasts with the fluid inclusion signature of the A-type veins from the Late Cretaceous Ermi deposit. High-temperature quartz associated with potassic alteration of the wall rocks at Ermi contain intermediate-density fluid inclusions that have been affected by post-entrapment modification because the fluid inclusions could not withstand the large pressure differential developed during the transition from lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions (Vityk and Bodnar, 1995; Chang et al., 2018; Monecke et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2021). The pressure change would have occurred as the magmatic-hydrothermal system cooled across the ductile to brittle transition (Sun et al., 2021). The presence of intermediate-density fluid inclusions in the high-temperature quartz suggests that Ermi is a deep porphyry system emplaced more than \u223c4.2\u00a0km below paleosurface (Monecke et al., 2018).\nAt present there are no reliable depth constraints for the Early Cretaceous March 5 Youth Cu-Mo porphyry located in North Korea. However, it is well recognized that Mo-bearing porphyry systems form at greater depth than Cu and Cu-Au porphyries. Murakami et al. (2010) suggested that porphyry Cu-Mo deposits are formed at average depths of 3.7\u00a0km whereas porphyry Cu deposits are formed at an average depth of 2.1\u00a0km below paleosurface.\nNone of the porphyry deposits in the Hunjiang basin are associated with intermediate- or high-sulfidation epithermal deposits. Kirwin and Royle (2018) noted a similar conspicuous absence of epithermal deposits around porphyry deposits in southeast Asia that are spatially associated with distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits. They proposed that the chemistry of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and the calcareous composition of the host rocks may be responsible for the lack of lithocaps and high-sulfidation epithermal deposits. In the case of the Hunjiang basin, however, the lack of epithermal deposits could be related to the depth at which the porphyritic intrusions were emplaced. Lithocaps may not have formed above the deeper-formed Cretaceous porphyry systems in the basin because the magmatic-hydrothermal fluids would never have reached the two-phase field of the H2O-NaCl system required for vapor formation (Monecke et al., 2018) and subsequent vapor condensation in the shallow subsurface to produce the highly acidic groundwaters responsible for the intense high-sulfidation alteration (Stoffregen, 1987; Hedenquist and Taran, 2013; Holley et al., 2017). Alternatively, if epithermal deposits formed in association with the Mesozoic igneous activity in Hunjiang basin, these deposits may not be preserved due to the current deep level of erosion.\n\n\n10.2.4\nSignificance of the distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits\nWhereas the Hunjiang basin contains no obvious epithermal deposits, it does host sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits, the largest of which is the White Mountain deposit (Keevil, 2019). The ore and alteration mineralogy at White Mountain suggests that the ore-bearing fluids were moderately acidic, consistent with deposit formation distal to a causative intrusion (Keevil, 2019). Although the deposits in the basin could not be dated, an altered granodiorite sill cutting the hangingwall sandstone at White Mountain was dated by LA-ICP-MS at 132\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Keevil et al., 2019). This provides a maximum age on the Au-forming event. Microthermometric data on Au-bearing hydrothermal quartz suggest ore-forming temperatures of\u00a0<200 \u00b0C and salinities of \u223c1\u20134\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent (Keevil, 2019), which are typical salinities expected from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that have been diluted by cool meteoric water (Sillitoe, 2010; Monecke et al., 2018). The absence of fluid inclusion evidence suggestive of boiling (Keevil, 2019) supports the assumption that mineralization at White Mountain can be related to a deep porphyry intrusion.\nIn general, many characteristics of the White Mountain deposit are consistent with features of other sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits that occur in mainly carbonate successions surrounding causative porphyritic intrusions (Sillitoe and Bonham, 1990). These include deposits such as Bald Mountain in Nevada (Ilchik, 1990; Nutt and Hofstra, 2007), Barneys Canyon and Melco in Utah (Cunningham et al., 2004), Jer\u00f3nimo in Chile (Thompson et al., 2004), and those of the Bau district in Malaysia (Percival et al., 2018). The low temperature of ore formation, silicification and decarbonatization of the wall rock, widespread brecciation, and the enrichment of pathfinder elements such as Ba, As, Hg, Sb, and Tl at White Mountain (Keevil, 2019) are typical of sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits.\nOther sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in the basin including Fuxingcun, Shijiapuzi, Gangou, and Xiaoshiren share some similarities to White Mountain. Reconnaissance fluid inclusion petrography on quartz from these Au deposits suggests ore-formation temperatures were no greater than about 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Keevil, 2019). Similar to White Mountain, Au mineralization at Xiaoshiren is closely associated with hematite, suggesting that the reaction of this mineral with the magmatic-hydrothermal fluids was important for mineralization. Except for Fuxingcun, all other sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in the basin are clearly located in proximity to intrusive centers that host other types of magmatic-hydrothermal deposits (Fig. 3).\nHowever, there are also some important differences between the sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in the Hunjiang basin and similar sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits elsewhere. Where observed, Au is present as native gold in oxide ores in the deposits of the Hunjiang basin, commonly in association with oxidized sulfide minerals (Fig. 14b, h), rather than occurring in sulfide ores as invisible Au in arsenian growth zones of pyrite or marcasite (Cline et al., 2005; Sillitoe, 2020). Minor amounts of base metals are contained in the ores of the deposits in the Hunjiang basin and Cu is also recovered at Fuxingcun. The ore mineralogy of the sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in the Hunjiang basin can be best explained by the model of Sillitoe (2020) proposing a continuum of deposits styles between proximal carbonate replacement deposits that form from higher temperature magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and more distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits formed by distinctly low-temperature and more dilute magmatic-hydrothermal fluids.\n\n\n\n10.3\nMetallogenic model for the Hunjiang basin\nA regional study in the Hunjiang basin showed that igneous activity in the Hunjiang basin at \u223c180\u2013165\u00a0Ma was a result of subduction of the Izanagi plate under the ENCB (Fig. 18; Keevil et al., 2019\n). The Early to Middle Jurassic magmatism was associated with the formation of some of the magmatic-hydrothermal deposits in the basin. Most notable are the \u223c170\u00a0Ma Nancha Au skarn (Chai et al., 2016) and the \u223c167\u00a0Ma Liudaojiang porphyry deposit (Keevil et al., 2019). The Early to Middle Jurassic ages of these deposits in the Hunjiang basin overlap with those of other magmatic-hydrothermal mineral deposits in northeastern China (Fig. 18), which were also associated with NW-directed subduction of the Izanagi plate below the ENCB (Goldfarb et al., 2021).\nIzanagi Plate rollback beginning at ca. 140\u00a0Ma contributed to an extension-related Early Cretaceous metallogenic event in the ENCB (Goldfarb et al., 2014, 2021). Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal deposits formed along much of the length of China\u2019s eastern border with southeast Russia and North Korea (Han et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013). Igneous activity coinciding with lithospheric delamination under the ENCB peaked at \u223c140\u2013120\u00a0Ma within the Hunjiang basin (Fig. 18; Keevil et al., 2019).\nWhile the Liudaojiang porphyry and associated skarn deposit formed in the Middle Jurassic (Keevil et al., 2019) and is a more typical subduction-related porphyry deposit, the Cretaceous Ermi deposit formed after the main lithospheric delamination event under the ENCB, and therefore is likely to be a post-subduction porphyry (Fig. 19\n; Richards, 2009). Although most porphyry deposits form in arcs above subduction zones, porphyry deposits with almost identical characteristics to more traditional porphyries have been recently observed in settings where magmas were generated after cessation of subduction (Fig. 19; Richards, 2009). During these post-subduction processes, which may occur after lithospheric delamination, mineralized intrusions may form from partial melting of mafic lower crust with metals and sulfur being derived from melting of pre-existing sulfide phases (Yang and Cooke, 2019). These porphyry deposits do not occur in arcs but are more isolated, consistent with the deposits observed in the Hunjiang basin that are not situated within a well-defined arc setting.\nThe \u223c130\u00a0Ma Linjiang Cu-Mo skarn (Zhang et al., 2015, 2019) was formed as a result of igneous activity associated with lithospheric delamination, and the March 5 Youth deposit in North Korea is interpreted to have formed at the same time (Zhang et al., 2018). The Hyesan porphyry and skarn deposits in North Korea are associated with a \u223c127\u00a0Ma intrusive complex (Sun, 1994) and the Changfagou porphyry on the north side of the basin occurs in igneous rocks that have been dated at \u223c117\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2015). Geological constraints suggest that at least some sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in the Hunjiang basin, including the White Mountain deposit, are distal deposits associated with the Early Cretaceous porphyry intrusions. Similar to other porphyry systems, skarn and carbonate replacement deposits are relatively proximal to their causative intrusions (Sillitoe, 2010), while the sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits in Hunjiang basin are located \u223c1\u201310\u00a0km from the porphyry centers. At the White Mountain deposit, Au-bearing fluids traveled up northwest-trending normal faults (Fig. 3) and precipitated gold upon reaction with the highly reactive hematite-rich rocks of the F100 unit.\nThe \u223c90\u00a0Ma Ermi deposit (Keevil et al., 2019) is a comparably young, post-subduction porphyry deposit that formed due to extensional processes after the main lithospheric delamination event under the ENCB. However, 90\u00a0Ma is not an age of known porphyry mineralization in other parts of northeastern China (Fig. 18).\n\n\n\n11\nExploration implications and conclusions\nThe field investigations conducted as part of this study suggest that a wide range of ore deposit types are present in the Hunjiang basin, which are hosted by the Archean metamorphic basement or the Proterozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks forming the basin infill. Many of the mineral occurrences are only of local economic importance. This includes magnetite deposits located in the Archean basement as well as hematite deposits mined within the northern part of the basin that are located along the F100 unit at the top of the Proterozoic Zhenzhumen Formation. Although several Fe skarn deposits associated with Mesozoic intrusions occur in the basin, these are not likely to become significant sources of Fe when compared to banded Fe ore deposits mined elsewhere in China and in other parts of the world.\nThe uplifted metamorphic basement of the Hunjiang basin is host to the Yuejin orogenic Au deposit. Further exploration for this deposit type within the uplifted basement, as well as outside of the basin, may identify additional Au resources but will ultimately require better definition of the regional structural controls that typically are associated with productive orogenic Au deposits (Goldfarb et al., 2005). Given the fact that Yuejin is the only certain orogenic Au deposit identified to date, further exploration for this deposit type within the Hunjiang basin area may not be warranted. Similarly, polymetallic Co-Cu and Ni-Co-Cu deposits identified within the Hunjiang basin appear to be small and may not be attractive exploration targets. Furthermore, geological and genetic characteristics of these deposits are currently poorly constrained limiting development of exploration strategies for these occurrences.\nThe results of this study have, however, significant implications to exploration for magmatic-hydrothermal base and precious metal deposits associated with Mesozoic intrusions emplaced into the basin rocks. It is demonstrated that the Hunjiang basin is host to porphyry deposit and associated skarns, carbonate replacement, and more distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits. This highlights the prospectivity of the basin and potentially a large part of northeastern China. Subduction-related porphyry deposits similar to the Liudaojiang deposit may be associated with Middle Jurassic igneous rocks, while extension-related porphyries such as Ermi and those in North Korea may be hosted by Early Cretaceous igneous centers. The March 5 Youth Cu-Mo deposit in North Korea is the largest porphyry in the basin and formed in such an extensional tectonic setting (Keevil et al., 2019).\nEconomically most significant are the distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits that appear to be associated with the Early Cretaceous igneous centers. Within the Hunjiang basin, the location of distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits is strongly controlled by the Fe-rich F100 unit. The occurrence of scalloped and ribbon-like quartz clasts oriented subparallel to bedding suggests that the F100 unit represents a vanished evaporite that underwent silicification during diagenesis (Chowns and Elkins, 1974; Chandler, 1988). The high hematite content allowed the F100 unit to act as a chemical trap for Au transported by hydrothermal fluids sourced from the porphyry intrusions.\nWhite Mountain, which currently is the most significant distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposit in Hunjiang basin, formed at the intersection of an extensional fault with the F100 unit. Gold mineralization occurred as a result of the interaction of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids with the chemically highly reactive rocks. There is significant exploration potential for this type of stratabound Au deposit because the F100 unit outcrops extensively throughout the northern part of Hunjiang basin and locally is stratigraphically repeated due to reverse faulting. Exploration for other distal sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits along the F100 unit could be aided by geochemical vectoring as the low-temperature hydrothermal fluids forming the Au mineralization typically also cause enrichment of the pathfinder elements Ba, As, Hg, Sb, and Tl (Cunningham et al., 2004; Knaak et al., 2016; Kirwin and Royle, 2018; Palinka\u0161 et al., 2018; Percival et al., 2018). The lack of epithermal occurrences or lithocaps within the basin indicates that the porphyry intrusions associated with the magmatic-hydrothermal systems forming sedimentary rock-hosted Au deposits were likely emplaced relatively deep below the paleosurface. The proposed genetic model for the magmatic-hydrothermal deposits of the Hunjiang basin is shown in Fig. 20\n.\n\n","10":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nRare earth elements (REEs) are essential for high-technology industries and defense systems (Wang et al., 2016a). Carbonatite-associated REE deposits (CARDs) are the most significant REE deposit type, accounting for the majority of light REE (LREE) reserves worldwide (Song et al., 2013; Goodenough et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017, 2018; Andersson et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020). The Weishan deposit in the Luxi Block (LB) of the eastern North China Craton (NCC), a hydrothermal REE deposit in carbonatite\u2013alkaline complexes (Yu et al., 2010; Lan et al., 2011a; Tian et al., 2002; Liang et al., 2017), is one of the three largest LREE deposits in China (in addition to Bayan Obo in Inner Mongolia and Mianning in Sichuan Province) (Li et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2020). In recent years, many new orebodies have been discovered in the deposit, bringing its cumulative REE ore reserves to 9.4 million tons and its REE oxide reserves to 443,000 tons. The CARDs in China are all located along the margins of the Precambrian block (Hou et al., 2015). It has been suggested that the Bayan Obo and Mianning REE deposits formed from LREE-rich melts derived from REE-refertilized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) related to the recycling of marine sediments (Hou et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2020). However, the source of the ore-forming material of the Weishan REE deposit is still unclear.\nThe LB is located in the eastern domain of the NCC (Fig. 1\n). Under the influence of lithospheric thinning of the NCC since the Paleozoic, extensive alkaline intrusions have occurred in the LB, particularly in the Weishan-Xuecheng-Longbaoshan areas (Chen et al., 2009; Kusky, 2011; Xia et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2021), where several REE deposits have been discovered (Ying et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2010). Alkali-rich intrusive rocks commonly occur in extensional tectonic settings, originate from a deep magmatic source and involve mantle components. These rocks offer an ideal opportunity to probe the deep magmatic evolution and the properties of the lithospheric mantle (Lynch et al., 1993; Yan et al., 2008; Ying et al., 2011).\nMany geological investigations have been performed on the Weishan deposit in terms of diagenetic age (129\u2013119\u00a0Ma; Wang et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2011a), metallogenesis and ore-forming fluid characteristics, and considerable progress has been achieved in recent years (Lan et al., 2011a; Liang et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2022). Nevertheless, few data are available on the isotopic composition of the carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex and orebodies. This lack of data is an obstacle to better understanding the source of the ore-forming material and the genetic relationship between REE mineralization and thinning of the SCLM beneath the NCC. In this study, we carry out petrographic, whole-rock major and trace element, Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope and zircon U\u2013Pb\u2013Hf isotope studies of the Weishan REE deposit. Our aim is to constrain the genesis, age and tectonic setting of the deposit. In addition, in this study, we propose a viable genetic model for the parent metallogenic magma of the Weishan REE deposit.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe NCC is one of the oldest Archean cratons on Earth (Zhao et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2004; Wilde and Zhao, 2005; Wu et al., 2008; Bagas et al., 2021) and is composed of the Western Block (WB), the Eastern Block (EB) and the intervening collision zone called the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO) (Fig. 1; Guo et al., 2005; Wilde and Zhao, 2005; Zhai et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2020). Since the Paleozoic, the WB of the NCC has been relatively stable, while the lithosphere of the EB has undergone substantial thinning or destruction. The Paleozoic SCLM beneath the NCC was characterized by enriched radiogenic isotope compositions, and this SCLM was replaced by a young and fertile SCLM through lithospheric thinning during the Mesozoic (Menzies et al.,1993; Zhang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2021).\nThe LB is located in the eastern domain of the NCC and is bounded by the Qihe\u2013Guangrao fault to the north, the Fengpei fault to the south, the Tan-Lu fault to the east, and the Liaocheng\u2013Lankao fault to the west (Fig. 1; Zhang et al., 2007a; Xu et al., 2015; Duan et al., 2020). The lithologies in the LB comprise Neoarchean gneisses, amphibolites and trondhjemite\u2013tonalite\u2013granodiorites (TTGs), Paleoproterozoic granitoids, Paleozoic carbonates interbedded with clastic rocks, and Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental clastic rocks and volcaniclastic rocks (Fig. 1; Guo et al., 2014; Duan and Li, 2017).\nDuring the Mesozoic, the eastern part of the NCC was characterized by extensive and widespread magmatism that has been correlated with the removal or modification of the SCLM. Mesozoic mineralization in the LB was correlated with these geotectonic events (Wu et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2020). Two main periods of magmatism have been recognized in the LB: the Middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Zhong and Huang, 2012; Zheng et al., 2018). The Middle Jurassic magmatic activity is relatively limited in extent and is represented by the Tongshi intrusive complex in the Pingyi area (Lan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2005). The Early Cretaceous magmatic activity was widespread in the LB and is represented by gabbro or diorite rocks in Jinan, Zouping, Jinling (Zibo City), and Tiezhai (Linqu) in the north (Yang et al., 2012); gabbroic intrusive rocks in Tietonggou and Laiwu in the central area (Yang et al., 2005); intermediate-felsic rocks in Tongjing (Yinan), Hutouya (Mengyin) and Liujing (Zaozhuang) (Wang et al., 2011; Zhong and Huang, 2012); and alkaline rocks in Longbaoshan and Weishan in the south (Hu et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2010; Jin, 2017; Yu et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\nThe Weishan REE deposit is located approximately 17\u00a0km southeast of Weishan County, Shandong Province (Fig. 1). The strata of the Weishan mining area are mainly Neoarchean gneisses. The magmatic rocks exposed in the area are Early Cretaceous quartz syenite, aegirine quartz syenite porphyry and alkaline granite (Weishan alkaline complex). Dykes, including carbonatite, diorite porphyrite, lamprophyre and granite porphyry, are common (Fig. 2\n). The study area is cut by approximately NW-, N-, NE- and E\u2013W-trending faults.\nREE mineralization occurred within quartz syenite and gneiss and was controlled by NW- and NE-trending faults. Depending on the occurrence characteristics, the REE orebodies can be divided into three types: vein, stockwork and dissemination (Fig. 3\na, b). Among these types, the vein-type orebodies show a larger thickness and better continuity and are the most economical type in the Weishan REE deposit (Fig. 3b). According to the mineral assemblages and cross-cutting relationships, the vein-type orebodies can be divided into (1) REE-bearing carbonatite veins; (2) REE-bearing quartz\u2013fluorite\u2013calcite veins; and (3) REE-bearing quartz\u2013barite\u2013calcite veins. The REE-bearing carbonatite veins are the largest and most widely distributed in the Weishan REE deposit (Li et al., 2009). The average grade of the REE oxides (RE2O3) in the ores is approximately 4.6%. Some of the veins show extraordinary REE enrichment (Fig. 3f), with a grade of up to 15.9\u201318.2% (Wang et al., 2016b). The ore minerals at Weishan include bastnaesite, parasite and carbocernaite, and minor amounts of monazite, strontianite, thorianite and apatite. The gangue minerals are mainly calcite, quartz, barite and fluorite (Xu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).\nOn the basis of petrographic observations, four mineralization stages have been recognized: (1) the silicate magma stage; (2) the carbonatite magma stage; (3) the carbonatite magmatic-hydrothermal stage; and (4) the hydrothermal-hypergene stage (Li et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019). The carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex formed during the silicate magma and carbonatite magma stages. The mineral assemblage in the carbonatite magmatic-hydrothermal stage consists of calcite, barite, fluorite and quartz and large amounts of bastnaesites (Fig. 4\n). The hydrothermal-hypergene stage is characterized by bastnaesite, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite assemblages. The REE minerals mainly formed during the carbonatite magmatic-hydrothermal stage. The REE minerals in the early mineralization stage display a euhedral\u2013subhedral and long columnar texture (Fig. 4e), whereas later REE minerals display a xenomorphic and coarse-grained texture and replace the coarse calcite and strontianite (Fig. 4f) (Wang et al., 2019).\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical procedure\nFive quartz syenite (18cs-08, 18cs-10, 18cs-11, 18cs-12, 18cs-33) (Fig. 5\na, b), three postmineralization granite porphyry dyke (18cs-25, 18cs-26, 18cs-27) (Fig. 5c, d), five gneiss (18cs-23, 18cs-24, 18cs-30, 18cs-34-1, 18cs-34-2) (Fig. 5e, f), and five REE-bearing carbonatite (18cs-5, 18cs-7, 18cs-18, 18cs-20, 18cs-32) (Figs. 3, 4) samples from the Weishan REE deposit were collected for petrographic, whole-rock geochemical and Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope studies. Zircon grains for U\u2013Pb\u2013Hf analyses were separated from samples 18cs-08 (quartz syenite) and 18cs-25 (granite porphyry dyke). Most of the samples were collected from a roadway at the \u2212160\u00a0m level at the deposit, with two samples (18cs-08 and 18cs-10) collected from outcrops (Fig. 2).\nThe quartz syenite is generally gray to pink, medium- to coarse-grained, and consists of K-feldspar (50\u00a0vol%), quartz (20\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (25\u00a0vol%), and aegirine\u2013augite (5\u00a0vol%). The K-feldspar is subhedral columnar or granular in shape with Carlsbad twinning and evident perthitic texture (Fig. 5a, b). The granite porphyry dyke is generally gray in color and porphyritic in texture, with phenocrysts of K-feldspar (0.5\u20132.0\u00a0mm), biotite (0.3\u20130.7\u00a0mm), plagioclase (0.5\u20131.0\u00a0mm) and quartz (0.3\u20130.5\u00a0mm). Minerals in the groundmass are fine-grained (10\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) and mainly consist of K-feldspar, quartz, plagioclase and minor biotite (Fig. 5c, d).\n\n4.1\nMajor and trace elements\nThe major and trace element compositions were analyzed by Beijing Createch Testing Technology Co., Ltd. Major elements were measured with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF; XRF-1800; SHIMADZU) using fused glass disks. Trace element compositions were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry (ICP\u2013MS; 7500ce; Agilent) after acid digestion of samples in Teflon bombs. Details of the analytical methods and procedures are described by Li et al. (2021). Analyses of standards (BCR-2, BHVO-2, and GSP-2) indicated that the analytical precision and accuracy were better than 5% for the major elements and 10% for the trace elements and REEs (Rudnick et al., 2004).\n\n\n4.2\nZircon LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS dating\nZircons were extracted from crushed samples using standard density and magnetic separation techniques followed by hand-picking using a binocular microscope at the Langfang Regional Geological Survey, Hebei Province, China. The grains were then mounted in epoxy and polished. Reflected and transmitted light photomicrographs and cathodoluminescence (CL) scanning electron microscope images were taken on the zircons prior to LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS analysis.\nLA\u2013ICP\u2013MS zircon U\u2013Pb dating was completed at the Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, using a Finnigan Neptune-type MC\u2013ICP\u2013MS instrument and the associated supporting Newwave UP 213 LA system. The analysis spots were 25\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. The isotopes 207Pb, 206Pb, 204Pb (+204Hg) and 202Hg with smaller concentrations were analyzed with multi-ioncounters, and the 208Pb, 232Th and 238U isotopes were analyzed using a Faraday cup. Helium was used as a carrier gas, and argon was used as the make-up gas mixed with the carrier gas through a T-connector before entering the ICP. Each analysis incorporated a background acquisition of approximately 20\u201330\u00a0s (gas blank) followed by 30\u00a0s of data acquisition from the sample. Detailed analytical techniques were described by Hou et al. (2009). The data processing was conducted with the help of the ICPMSDataCal program (Liu et al., 2008). The zircon concordia age diagrams were obtained using the Isoplot 3.0 program of Ludwig (2003). Zircons GJ-1 and M127 (923\u00a0ppm U, 439\u00a0ppm Th, Th\/U value of 0.475; Nasdala et al., 2008) were chosen as standards for U\u2013Pb zircon dating and U and Th correction. The test accuracy of 207Pb\/206Pb, 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/235U from the uniform zircon grains was approximately 2%, and the standard zircon dating precision and accuracy were approximately 1%. The standard zircon Plesovice was dated as unknown samples and yielded a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 336.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a010, 2\u03c3), which is in good agreement with the recommended 206Pb\/238U age of 337.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma (2\u03c3; Slama et al., 2008).\n\n\n4.3\nWhole-rock Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope analyses\nWhole-rock Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions of the samples were measured using an MC\u2013ICP\u2013MS instrument (Neptune plus) at Beijing Createch Testing Technology Co., Ltd. The samples were dissolved in Teflon beakers with 1\u00a0ml of HNO3 and 2\u00a0ml of HF acid at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days. The Pb was separated using the conventional anionic resin-exchange technique with HCl. The Sr and REEs in these solutions were separated using standard cation exchange columns with special Sr resin. The Nd was separated from the REEs using AG502X12-coated columns. The detailed analytical procedures for Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope analysis are described in detail by Pin et al. (2014).\nThe mass fractionation corrections for 87Sr\/86Sr and 143Nd\/144Nd ratios were based on an 86Sr\/88Sr value of 0.1194 and a 146Nd\/144Nd value of 0.7219. During Pb isotopic analyses, Tl was added to the samples as an internal standard for correcting mass-dependent isotopic fractionation. The exponential correction value of 203Tl\/205Tl applied to these samples was 0.418922. The measured 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the NBS987 standard and 143Nd\/144Nd ratios of the BCR-2 standard were 0.710248\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 and 0.512600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05, respectively. Repeated analyses of the BCR-2 standard yielded a 206Pb\/204Pb ratio of 18.7477\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03, 207Pb\/204Pb ratio of 15.6111\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03, and 208Pb\/204Pb ratio of 38.6921\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07, which are identical within error to their recommended values (Yang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Weis et al., 2006).\n\n\n4.4\nZircon Lu\u2013Hf isotope analyses\nThe in situ Hf isotope ratio analysis was conducted using a Neptune Plus MC\u2013ICP\u2013MS instrument in combination with a Resolution SE 193\u00a0nm LA system at the Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The measuring points were repeated or close to each other in the same zircons used for zircon LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS U\u2013Pb dating. The analysis spots are 40\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. Helium was used as the carrier gas within the ablation cell and was merged with argon (makeup gas) after the ablation cell. The Hf and Yb isotope ratios were standardized to 179Hf\/177Hf\u00a0=\u00a00.7325 and 173Yb\/172Yb\u00a0=\u00a01.35274 in the experiment. The measured 176Hf\/177Hf ratio of the GJ1 zircon standard was 0.282008\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020. This ratio is consistent with the recommended 176Hf\/177Hf ratio of 0.282000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 reported by Morel et al. (2008). Details of the analytical methods and data acquisition procedures are similar to those described by Hou et al. (2007) and Wu et al. (2007).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nMajor element geochemistry\nThe whole-rock major and trace element compositions of the quartz syenite, gneiss, granite porphyry dyke, and REE-bearing carbonatite samples are presented in Table 1\n.\nThe quartz syenite has 69.02 to 71.72\u00a0wt% SiO2, 13.51 to 16.12\u00a0wt% Al2O3, 3.67 to 5.34\u00a0wt% K2O, and 5.85 to 7.13\u00a0wt% Na2O. On a total alkali versus silica (TAS) diagram (Fig. 6\n), most of the samples plot in the quartz monzonite field, and all samples straddle the high-K calc-alkaline series on the K2O versus SiO2 plot (Fig. 7\na). The Rittmann index for all of the samples ranges from 3.87 to 4.58, indicating that the quartz syenite is an alkaline rock. The A\/CNK value for the samples ranges from 0.83 to 0.97, and the A\/NK value ranges from 0.91 to 1.02. These ratios plot in the peralkaline zone on an A\/NK versus A\/CNK diagram (Fig. 7b).\nThe granite porphyry dyke has high SiO2 (70.09\u201375.48\u00a0wt%) and moderately high K2O (3.25\u20133.51\u00a0wt%) and Na2O (5.55\u20135.92\u00a0wt%) concentrations. The samples plot in the granite field on a TAS diagram (Fig. 6) and the transitional zone between calc-alkaline and high-K calc-alkaline series on the K2O versus SiO2 plot (Fig. 7a). The Rittmann index for all of the samples ranges from 2.74 to 2.96, indicating that the granite porphyry dyke is calc-alkaline rock. The A\/CNK value for all of the samples ranges from 0.95 to 0.98, and the A\/NK value ranges from 1.00 to 1.21. These ratios plot in the metaluminous zone on an A\/NK versus A\/CNK diagram (Fig. 7b).\nThe analyses show that the carbonatites in the Weishan deposit have low SiO2 (0.38\u201315.29\u00a0wt%), TFe2O3 (0.08\u20130.61\u00a0wt%) and MgO (0.04\u20130.51\u00a0wt%) concentrations and a wide range of CaO concentrations (4.31\u201324.43\u00a0wt%). In the CaO\u2013MgO\u2013FeO\u00a0+\u00a0Fe2O3\u00a0+\u00a0MnO carbonatite classification plot (Fig. 8\n), the Weishan carbonatites have chemical compositions similar to those of calciocarbonatite but distinct from those of primary calcite carbonatites derived from direct melting of carbonated mantle sources (Lee and Wyllie, 1998; Hou et al., 2015).\n\n\n5.2\nTrace element and REE geochemistry\nThe quartz syenite contains total REE concentrations (\u03a3REE) of 474.6\u20132867\u00a0ppm, with LREE\/HREE ratios of 29.8\u201376.8, (La\/Yb)N values of 50.5\u2013846.7, Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu) of 0.71\u20130.96, and Ce anomalies (\u03b4Ce) of 0.71\u20130.85. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns (Fig. 9\n) show obvious REE fractionation and are characterized by enrichment in LREEs and depletion in heavy REEs (HREEs). On the primitive mantle-normalized trace element spider diagram (Fig. 10\n), the quartz syenite is enriched in LILEs (Rb, Ba, and Sr), depleted in HFSEs (Nb and Ta), and exhibits positive Pb anomalies and negative P and Ti anomalies.\nThe granite porphyry dyke shows \u201cslight right-dipping\u201d forms in the chondrite-normalized REE diagram (Fig. 9) and has a \u03a3REE of 64.9\u201387.5\u00a0ppm, LREE\/HREE ratios of 13.1\u201329.1, and (La\/Yb)N values of 14.8\u201376.6. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns also show the absence of or slightly negative Ce (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a00.96\u20131.03) anomalies. In the primitive mantle-normalized trace element diagram (Fig. 10), the granite porphyry dyke shows depletions in HFSEs (Nb and Ta) and exhibits positive Pb anomalies and negative P and Ti anomalies.\nThe carbonatites are extremely enriched in REEs (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a025820.9\u2013136225.4\u00a0ppm), with LREE\/HREE ratios of 65.8\u2013167.7 and (La\/Yb)N values of 815.0\u201345953.1. The carbonatites show \u201csteeply right-dipping\u201d forms in the chondrite-normalized REE diagram (Fig. 9) and obvious REE fractionation characterized by enrichment in LREEs and depletion in HREEs. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns also show negative Eu (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u20130.68) anomalies and the absence of or slightly negative Ce (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a00.64\u20130.99) anomalies.\nThe carbonatites are depleted in HFSEs (Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf), extremely enriched in LILEs (Rb, Ba, and Sr), and exhibit negative P and Ti anomalies (Fig. 10). The carbonatites have high concentrations of Sr (14538.7\u2013133223.5\u00a0ppm) and Ba (8266.7\u201390173.9\u00a0ppm), relatively low ratios of Sr\/Ba (0.32\u20138.29) and Nb\/Y (0.01\u20130.72), and high ratios of Ba\/Th (647\u201346030). These features are consistent with other CARD-hosted carbonatites but differ from most barren carbonatites worldwide (Fig. 11\n; Ying et al., 2004; Castor, 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2015).\n\n\n5.3\nZircon LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS U\u2013Pb dating\nThe zircons from quartz syenite sample 18cs-08 are dark in color, approximately 100\u2013210\u00a0\u03bcm long and 40\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm wide, with length\/width ratios of approximately 1.5:1 to 1:1. Although most of the zircons are fragmented, concentric oscillatory zoning is well developed on CL (Fig. 12\n). The zircons in the granite porphyry dyke from Weishan are euhedral, transparent, colorless and short columnar. They are generally 40 to 150\u00a0\u03bcm long, with length\/width ratios of approximately 5:1 to 1.5:1. Concentric oscillatory zoning is well developed, as observed in the CL images. Some of the zircons have inherited cores (Fig. 12).\nTo eliminate the effect of inherited and lost Pb on the age determination, age data with a concordant degree below 90% in the 207Pb\/235U\u2013\n206Pb\/238U plot were removed. The reduced dates are listed in Table 2\n, and concordia diagrams are shown in Fig. 13\n.\nThe zircons from the quartz syenite have 238U contents of 74.4\u20131048.3\u00a0ppm, 232Th concentrations of 3.5\u20131778.5\u00a0ppm, and 232Th\/238U ratios of 0.05\u20131.88 (most of the ratios cluster at 0.13\u20130.74). These analyses plot near or on the concordia line and form a tight cluster on the concordia plot (Fig. 13). The 206Pb\/238U ages for these zircons range from 122.1 to 127.3\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 124.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a010, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.7), which is interpreted to represent the crystallization age of these zircons.\nThe zircons from the granite porphyry dyke have 238U contents of 534.8\u20131853.5\u00a0ppm, 232Th concentrations of 131.5\u2013761.9\u00a0ppm, and 232Th\/238U ratios of 0.25\u20130.71. The data of these zircons are concentrated on or near the concordia line and form a tight cluster on the concordia plot (Fig. 13). These zircons have 206Pb\/238U ages of 120.5\u2013125.8\u00a0Ma and a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 123.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a013, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.7), which is interpreted to represent the crystallization age of these zircons.\n\n\n5.4\nWhole-rock Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotopes\nThe Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope data and calculation results are presented in Table 3\n.\nThe quartz syenite has moderately high (87Sr\/86Sr)i ratios (0.7061\u20130.7075), negative \u03b5Nd(t) values (\u22128.94 to \u22128.26), and (206Pb\/204Pb)t, (207Pb\/204Pb)t and (208Pb\/204Pb)t ratios of 17.093\u201317.419, 15.429\u201315.469 and 36.573\u201337.134, respectively. The REE-bearing carbonatite has (87Sr\/86Sr)i ratios of 0.7072\u20130.7078, \u03b5Nd(t) values of \u22128.79 to \u22128.36, and (206Pb\/204Pb)t, (207Pb\/204Pb)t and (208Pb\/204Pb)t ratios of 17.436\u201317.593, 15.410\u201315.444 and 37.462\u201341.834, respectively. The granite porphyry dyke has (87Sr\/86Sr)i ratios of 0.7043\u20130.7075, \u03b5Nd(t) values of \u221215.47 to \u221210.18, and (206Pb\/204Pb)t, (207Pb\/204Pb)t and (208Pb\/204Pb)t ratios of 15.924\u201317.499, 15.130\u201315.420 and 35.961\u201336.510, respectively. The gneiss has high (87Sr\/86Sr)i ratios (0.7091\u20130.7149), negative \u03b5Nd(t) values (\u221227.19 to \u201322.57), and (206Pb\/204Pb)t, (207Pb\/204Pb)t and (208Pb\/204Pb)t ratios of 16.408\u201318.020, 15.241\u201315.512 and 36.788\u201338.248, respectively.\nThe REE-bearing carbonatite and quartz syenite in the Weishan REE deposit have similar isotopic compositions that differ markedly from those of the granite porphyry dyke and gneiss (Fig. 14\n). The Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotopic composition of the Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex is consistent with that of alkali-rich Mesozoic intrusive rocks near the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ) in the northern part of the Yangzi Craton (Yan et al., 2008), the Mesozoic alkaline rocks in the eastern NCC (Zhang et al., 2005; Lan et al., 2011b), and the Early Cretaceous enriched SCLM beneath the southeastern margin of the NCC (Fig. 14) (Yang et al., 2012).\n\n\n5.5\nZircon Hf isotopes\nAs shown in Table 4\n, the Lu\u2013Hf isotopic compositions of zircon grains from sample 18cs-08 (quartz syenite) have 176Hf\/177Hf ratios of 0. 282314\u20130. 282424, with calculated \u03b5Hf(t) values of \u221213.5 to \u22129.6 and average crustal Hf model ages (TDMC) of 1.78\u20132.03\u00a0Ga (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.90\u00a0Ga). The granite porphyry dyke has 176Hf\/177Hf ratios of 0.281946\u20130.282301, with calculated \u03b5Hf(t) values of \u221226.5 to \u221214.0 and average crustal Hf model ages (TDMC) of 2.06\u20132.84\u00a0Ga (mean\u00a0=\u00a02.29\u00a0Ga). The Hf isotope compositions of the quartz syenite plot in the field of the Mesozoic enriched SCLM of the NCC on an \u03b5Hf(t) versus age diagram, whereas the granite porphyry dyke plots in the transitional zone between the fields of the Mesozoic enriched SCLM and lower crust of the NCC on the diagram (Fig. 15\n).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nTiming of magmatism and mineralization\nZircon grains separated from the quartz syenite (Sample 18cs-08) exhibit well-developed concentric oscillatory zoning (Fig. 12) and have relatively high Th and U contents as well as high Th\/U ratios of >0.1 (Table 2), indicating that they are magmatic zircons. Thus, the zircon U\u2013Pb date of 124.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma is interpreted as the crystallization age of the quartz syenite. Similarly, the zircon U\u2013Pb age of sample 18cs-25 (123.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma) is interpreted as the crystallization age of the granite porphyry dyke at Weishan.\nThe diagenetic age of the quartz syenite obtained in this study agreed, within the error range, with the diagenetic age of the alkaline complex according to previous studies (122.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0Ma, Liang et al., 2017; 125.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, Wei et al., 2019). Therefore, we conclude that the diagenetic age of the alkaline complex in the Weishan REE deposit was approximately 124.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma. As the REE mineralization occurred in the alkaline complex, the diagenetic age of the complex provides an upper age limit for REE metallogenesis in Weishan. Field observations show that the granite porphyry dyke cuts through the REE orebodies. Therefore, the age of the granite porphyry dyke provides the lower age limit for REE metallogenesis in Weishan. Taking into account the previous results on the metallogenic age (129\u2013119\u00a0Ma) (Lan et al., 2011a; Wang et al., 2019), we infer that the timing of REE metallogenesis in Weishan was 124.6\u2013123.3\u00a0Ma (Early Cretaceous).\nSince the Paleozoic, the lithosphere of the EB has undergone substanital thinning or destruction, and its lithospheric thickness decreased from 200\u00a0km in the Paleozoic to 80\u00a0km in the Cenozoic (Chen, 2010; Zheng et al., 2013; Zhu and Xu, 2019; Yang et al., 2021). The destruction of the lithosphere peaked during the Early Cretaceous, as indicated by large-scale Early Cretaceous magmatism (135\u2013108\u00a0Ma) (Zheng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2005). It is generally accepted that the subduction angle of the Paleo-Pacific Plate increased and that the subduction zone retreated in the Early Cretaceous (Zhu and Xu, 2019). This caused substantial thinning of the SCLM beneath the eastern part of the NCC from 135 to 130\u00a0Ma and extensive destruction of the craton from 130 to 120\u00a0Ma (Menzies et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2018). Some researchers have suggested that the destruction of the NCC peaked at approximately 125\u00a0Ma (Yang et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). The time of diagenesis and metallogenesis in the Weishan REE deposit thus corresponded to the peak of lithospheric thinning or the destruction of the NCC.\n\n\n6.2\nMagma source\nThe Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope analyses showed that the quartz syenite and REE-bearing carbonatite in the Weishan REE deposit have similar isotopic compositions that differ markedly from those of the granite porphyry dyke and gneiss (Fig. 14). At the same time, there is a close spatial relationship between quartz syenite and REE-bearing carbonatite, and their diagenetic and metallogenetic ages are the same within error, indicating that the REE-bearing carbonatite and quartz syenite have a very close genetic relationship and originate from identical material sources.\nCarbonatites are often associated with alkali-rich intrusive rocks. They are widely regarded to be derived from an OIB-like isotopically depleted mantle domain (Lynch et al., 1993; Ying et al., 2007). However, this model cannot explain the enriched Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Hf isotopic composition (87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.7061\u20130.7078, \u03b5Nd(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128.94 to \u22128.26, \u03b5Hf(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221213.5 to \u22129.6) and extreme enrichment of REEs (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a025820.9\u2013136225.4\u00a0ppm) in the Weishan carbonatite-alkaline complex (Tables 1, 3 and 4). In the \u03b5Nd(t)\u2013(87Sr\/86Sr)i diagram, all quartz syenite and carbonatite samples plot near the enriched mantle evolution line (Fig. 14); in the Hf isotope diagram, all samples plot in the Mesozoic enriched lithospheric mantle field (Fig. 15). Positive correlations between (87Sr\/86Sr)i and Rb\/Sr ratios and Sr and SiO2 contents, and positive correlations between \u03b5Nd(t) and Sm\/Nd ratios and Nd and SiO2 contents are not observed in the Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex (Fig. 16\n), suggesting that these magmatic rocks have not experienced notable crustal contamination during their evolution. These results suggest that the Weishan quartz syenite and carbonatite were derived predominantly from enriched lithospheric mantle.\nIsotopic evidence from Mesozoic mantle-derived rocks and peridotite-bearing xenoliths in the NCC reveals that the Early Cretaceous (older than\u00a0\u223c\u00a0121\u00a0Ma) mafic magmatic rocks were derived from an arc-like, isotopically enriched mantle domain (Wu et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019). The Late Mesozoic SCLM beneath the NCC was characterized by enriched radiogenic isotope compositions (Fig. 14) and declining \u201cisland arc-like\u201d geochemical characteristics, notwithstanding the wide range and spatial heterogeneity of Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope values (Zhang et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2019). The NCC experienced the replacement of an ancient, thick and refractory SCLM by a young and fertile SCLM through lithospheric thinning during the Mesozoic (Zhang et al., 2004; Menzies et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2021).\nIt has been proposed that the enriched mantle sources were generated by metasomatism of the SCLM beneath the NCC by melts derived from either the delaminated NCC lower continental crust (Li et al., 2018) or the subducted South China Block (SCB) during the Triassic continental collision (Xu et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2007b). Some studies have suggested that both mechanisms of mantle source enrichment operated, with each playing a dominant role in different regions of the craton. For example, based on the Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb\u2013Hf isotope compositions of typical mafic rocks from western Shandong Province, Yang et al. (2012) concluded that melt derived from the delaminated and thickened lower continental crust of the NCC was responsible for the enriched SCLM in the northwestern part of western Shandong (far from the Tanlu Fault Zone), whereas melt derived from the broken-off subducted SCB modified the SCLM in the southeastern part of western Shandong (near the Tanlu Fault Zone).\nThe Pb isotope compositions of the mafic rocks on the southeastern margin of the NCC (e.g., Tietonggou and Yinan) are consistent with the ultrahigh-pressure eclogite and gneiss of the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt (Fig. 17\n; Zhao et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). With increasing distance from the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, mantle-derived magmatic rocks exhibit weakening Sr\u2013Nd isotope enrichment (Fig. 14), decreasing 204Pb\/206Pb ratios, and increasing Nb\/La ratios (Yang et al., 2012), suggesting decreasing participation of crustal components in the mantle source. In addition, the Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope compositions of mafic magmatic rocks in the Jiaodong area are consistent with those of the SCB crust and granitic gneiss in the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt (Fig. 17; Zhao et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2018). Therefore, it has been proposed that the enriched radiogenic isotope compositions of the SCLM in the southeastern margin of the NCC may have been related to crust\u2013mantle interactions resulting from the subduction of the SCB beneath the NCC (Yang et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019).\nThe carbonatite veins and quartz syenite of the Weishan REE deposit have isotopic compositions similar to those of the Late Mesozoic mafic rocks in the Tietonggou and Jiaoyu areas in the southeastern margin of the NCC (Figs. 14, 17; Yang et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2004) and the Mesozoic alkaline rocks in the Longbaoshan and Hongshan areas in the eastern NCC (Zhang et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Lan et al., 2011b). All these rocks plot within the fields of the Late Mesozoic enriched SCLM beneath the southeastern margin of the NCC in the \u03b5Nd(t)\u2013(87Sr\/86Sr)i diagram (Fig. 14) and of the Mesozoic enriched SCLM in the Hf isotope diagram (Fig. 15). In the Pb isotope diagrams, most of the samples plot within or near the fields corresponding to the enriched SCLM and the ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks of the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt (Fig. 17). Taking the previous results on the properties and genesis of the Mesozoic SCLM beneath the NCC into consideration, we infer that the metallogenic magma of the Weishan REE deposit was likely formed by melting of the SCLM, which had been previously metasomatized by melts derived from the subducted SCB during the Triassic continental collision.\n\n\n6.3\nGenetic model of the initial metallogenic magma\nTrace element analysis indicated that the REE-bearing carbonatite in the Weishan REE deposit was extremely enriched in REEs (25820.9\u2013136225.4\u00a0ppm), Sr (14538.7\u2013133223.5\u00a0ppm), and Ba (8266.7\u201390173.9\u00a0ppm). Carbonatites can become enriched in REEs, Sr and Ba through intracrustal processes, e.g., subsolidus remobilization (Ling et al., 2013) and liquid immiscibility (Castor, 2008; Yang et al., 2009). However, these processes cannot explain the extreme REE\u2013Sr\u2013Ba enrichment observed in the Weishan carbonatites (Hou et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2020). Moreover, the Weishan quartz syenite also yields high concentrations of REEs (up to 2867\u00a0ppm), Sr (up to 1103\u00a0ppm), and Ba (up to 6619\u00a0ppm). The Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex yields relatively uniform Pb isotope compositions (Fig. 17). Positive correlations between the initial Sr\u2013Nd isotope composition and Sr\u2013Nd content are not observed in the complex (Fig. 16), thus refuting the crustal contamination hypothesis (Xu et al., 2003) and indicating that the metallogenic magma had high Sr, Ba, and REE contents at the initial stage. Partial melting of the enriched SCLM can produce melts that inherit the enriched radiogenic isotope signatures. However, this model cannot explain the extreme enrichment of Sr, Ba, and REEs in the Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex. The extreme Sr, Ba, and REE enrichment of the parent metallogenic magma of the Weishan REE deposit should, therefore, be controlled by additional factors.\nMore than 500 carbonatite intrusions have been found all over the world (Bell and Tilton, 2002), but giant CARDs are rare and have only been discovered in China, North America, and the Kola Peninsula (Xie et al., 2015; Liu and Hou, 2017; Xie et al., 2020). All of these deposits are located along cratonic margins and share a number of similarities (Liu and Hou, 2017). It has been suggested that the giant CARDs formed from LREE-rich melts derived from REE-refertilized SCLM, which had been previously metasomatized by high-flux REE- and CO2-rich fluids derived from subducted marine sediments (Walter et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Hou et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2019). In this model, REE and Ba abundances are closely linked to seafloor hydrothermal sediments, whereas Sr content is controlled by carbonate phase abundances (Plank and Langmuir, 1998; Kato et al., 2011). This indicates that REE concentrations in subducted sediments are controlled by the ratio of hydrothermal mud to carbonate phases. Therefore, the Sr\/Ba ratio may reflect the quantitative proportions of carbonate and hydrothermal phases and the quantity of REEs that are metasomatically introduced into the SCLM (Hou et al., 2009, 2015; Liu et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019).\nThe Weishan REE deposit is located on the southeastern margin of the NCC. The carbonatite in the deposit has a high Ba\/Th ratio (Fig. 18\n). A positive correlation between the REE and Ba contents and a negative correlation between the REE content and Sr\/Ba ratio are observed in the Weishan carbonatite (Fig. 11). The Weishan carbonatite-alkaline complex yields Sr\u2013Nd\u2013Pb isotope arrays that shift toward marine sediments (Figs. 14, 17). These features are consistent with other CARD-hosted carbonatites and indicate that the excessive enrichment of Sr, Ba, and REEs in the Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex might be related to the involvement of CO2-rich fluids from recycled marine sediments.\nExperiments indicate that CO2-rich fluids generally have high concentrations of LILEs and relatively low concentrations of HFSEs with high LILE\/HFSE ratios (Elburg et al., 2002; Hammouda et al., 2009). The SCLM metasomatism by such CO2-rich fluids would produce carbonated peridotite enriched in LILEs and REEs. During the subsequent melting of this carbonated peridotite, HFSEs (Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf), heavy REEs and Y were retained in Ti oxides, while LILEs and LREEs were preferentially concentrated in the melt (D'Orazio et al., 1998; Foley et al., 2000; Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2006; Dasgupta et al., 2009; Gaetani et al., 2008; Hou et al., 2015). This scenario is consistent with certain geochemical features of the Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex, such as the extreme enrichment in LILEs and LREE relative depletion in HFSEs, low ratios of Nb\/Y, and strong fractionation of light and heavy REEs (Figs. 9, 10, 11).\nPrevious studies on the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the NCC also support the view that the fertility of the SCLM beneath the NCC depends on the release of REEs from recycled marine sediments. It has been proposed that the low-angle subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate during the early Mesozoic beneath the continental edge of eastern China played a key role in weakening and eroding the continental lithosphere in the NCC (Zhang et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2012; Kiminami and Imaoka, 2013; Zheng et al., 2018; Zhu and Xu, 2019). The subduction may have switched from low-angle subduction to high-angle subduction through slab roll-back and retreat at approximately 140\u00a0Ma (Wu et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2017). The rollback and retreat of the subducting plate in the Early Cretaceous triggered the partial melting of the SCLM as well as lithospheric extension and destruction (Zhu et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2021). The geochemical characteristics of the Weishan carbonatite\u2013alkaline complex indicate an extensional tectonic setting (Fig. 19\n). The peak time of lithospheric thinning and destruction of the NCC corresponded to the diagenesis and metallogenesis time of the Weishan REE deposit.\nIn summary, we propose a tentative genetic model of the parent metallogenic magma of the Weishan REE deposit. (1) Crust\u2013mantle interaction between the subducted SCB crust and the SCLM of the NCC during Triassic subduction of the SCB beneath the NCC (Fig. 20\na) and the involvement of high-flux REE- and CO2-rich fluids derived from subducted marine sediments during Jurassic low-angle subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath the continental edge of eastern China (Fig. 20b) gave rise to the isotopically enriched and REE-refertilized SCLM beneath the southeastern margin of the NCC. (2) The subduction switched from low-angle subduction to high-angle subduction through slab rollback and retreat in the Early Cretaceous (peaked at 130\u2013120\u00a0Ma). The lateral flow of the asthenospheric mantle filled the gap between the retreated plate and the SCLM and induced partial melting of the REE-refertilized and isotopically enriched SCLM, giving rise to the parent metallogenic magma of the Weishan REE deposit (Fig. 20c).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe diagenetic ages of the quartz syenite and postmineralization granite porphyry dyke sampled from the Weishan REE deposit are 124.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a010, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.7) and 123.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (n\u00a0=\u00a013, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.7), respectively.

At present, a large number of data on geological age, rock characteristics, isotopes and ore-forming elements have been accumulated in this region. Through the contrast analysis of the predecessors' research results, it can be summarized that the ore-forming process of the Tibet plateau has an intimate relationship with various periods in the geological tectonic movement (Li et al., 2017) and the tectonic movement for plate and terrane has brought a lot of ore-forming elements, which caused noticeable geochemical changes in the terrane junction (Hou et al., 2015a). Therefore, anomalous geochemical data can effectively inversion the accumulation of ore-forming elements in geological bodies caused by plate tectonic changes (Yang and Xie, 2017) and accurately reflect the spatial distribution of ore-forming bodies (Hou et al., 2015b). The combination of geochemical data and spatio-temporal analysis to explore the metallogenic potential of the Tibetan Plateau is of great significance to the prospecting and mining work of the Tibetan Plateau.\nDomestic and foreign researchers have conducted many traditional geological explorations on the petrology and chronology of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, especially in the late Mesozoic, achieved fruitful results, and accumulated oodles of geochemical and isotopic data. Isotopic mapping analysis is frequently used to determine geological age, while in recent years, it has been widely applied in metallogenic prediction. Isotope tracing technology is a crucial dating method in geological research. It is one of the most important means to explore the evolution process of crust and mantle, determine the lithosphere's material composition, and inverse the evolution of deep structure. Among them, isotopic mapping is mainly to map the regional area through a wide range of magmatic rock isotopic data, which can intuitively show the composition of deep elements, and to explore the influencing factors of geological changes and mineralization footprints, so as to provide vital support for the exploration of large-scale mineral resources and the evolution of geological and metallogenic characteristics. In China, Zhang et al. (2013) constrained the crustal properties and metallogenic potential of Lhasa by zircon Hf isotope mapping. Wang and Hou (2018) and Hou and Wang (2018) explored the mineralization of the Central Asian orogenic belt by isotope mapping. Wang et al. (2015b) used Nd-Hf isotope mapping to explore the metallogenic system of the Qinling Mountains. Du et al. (2016) applied Hf and Nd isotopes to seek the mineralization of the Sanjiang orogenic belt. In Australia, Mole et al. (2013) investigated the metallogenic system of the Yilgarn Craton area in Western Australia with isotope mapping techniques. Therefore, it can be seen from previous studies that regional isotope mapping has important guiding significance for metallogenic prediction. According to the above research results at home and abroad, Hf-Nd isotope mapping in a local range can explore the deep material composition, attribute characteristics and age of the orogenic belt and lithosphere, and can deeply identify the deep metallogenic process and formation conditions. As a \u201cpaleogeophysical exploration method\u201d, isotope mapping technology is efficient and fast, and is expected to become a new means of polymetallic prospecting and prediction. Therefore, exploring the geological structure and analyzing metallogenic characteristics with Nd and Hf isotopic mapping technology has developed into a new method for polymetallic prospecting and prediction, greatly enriching the exploration of metallogenic prediction.\nThe geochemical data collected from the Tibetan Plateau, where famous for being vast and rich in resources, is complex, diverse and uneven in format and type, and lacks a unified structure, making it difficult to extract and utilize the data. Therefore, the known geochemical data of the whole Tibetan Plateau can be combined with GIS Technology (Geographic Information System) to improve the fault tolerance rate, enhance the accuracy and efficiency of isotopic data analysis and research, reduce the research cost and save analysis time. GIS mapping analysis, combined with the spatial and attribute characteristics of geochemical data, provides an efficient and fast research platform for exploring the spatial distribution of metallogenic rocks in the Tibetan Plateau, and can promote the evaluation and prediction of mineral resources (Wang et al., 2015b).\nGIS Technology, combined with data analysis, through data statistics, data mining, data insight and prediction, can clean, calculate and identify the geological prospecting data related to strata, structures, rocks, isotopes, element content and other information associated with the formation of deposits, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of Research (Zuo et al., 2021). Geochemical data has typical spatial and attribute characteristics, which provides an effective platform for GIS mapping analysis to investigate the spatial distribution of ore-forming rocks in the Tibetan Plateau. It can clearly show the metallogenic characteristics and integrate them to delineate the prospecting prospect area and provide spatial decision-making for further prospecting (Wang et al., 2015b).\nBased on the brief analysis of the geological characteristics and geochemical data of the study area, the objective of this paper expounds on i)the analysis process of metallogenic characteristics of the Tibet Plateau with data analysis and GIS technology, ii)explores the extraction method of metallogenic information and rules based on isotope analysis, and iii) applied GIS technology to predict Cu, Au and other metallogenic rocks and polymetallic deposits. The significance of isotope metallogenic prediction and scientific prospecting are further revealed.\n\n\n2\nResearch area overview\nThe Tibet Plateau area has the most typical collision orogenic belt and the thickest crust (60\u201380\u00a0km) in the world, formed by the collision between the Asian continent and Indian continent around 65\u00a0Ma. It develops a vast magma belt and is rich in mineral resources, making this area the most potential metal mineral enrichment zone in China (Lu et al., 2011). Therefore, it is of global significance to further reveal the crustal composition of Tibet and explore the metallogenic rules, which will significantly enhance the scientific understanding of continental collision and metallogenesis.\nAccording to the differences of geological characteristics, as shown in (Fig. 1\n), the main suture zones in the Tibetan plateau area are Animaqing-Kunlun-Muzi sutures (AKMS), Jinshajiang sutures (JSJS), Longmuco-Shuanghu sutures (LSS), Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS) and Yarlung Zangbo sutures (IYZS), which can be divided into three parts: north, middle and South (Hou et al., 2013). Lhasa terrane to the north of Yarlung Zangbo sutures in the middle of Tibet Plateau and the South of Bangong-Nujiang sutures is the most metallogenic area in the Tibet Plateau. This area is a huge tectonic-magmatic belt undergoing the largest magmatic activity period, with the largest scale and the most complex magmatic type in Mesozoic (Zhu et al., 2013). Giant granite beds and a considerable quantity of Mesozoic-Cenozoic volcanic rocks are developed on it. Sedimentary caprock extends from Cambrian to Cenozoic. As a micro-block separated from Gondwana Continent, Lhasa terrane is strongly involved in Mesozoic proliferative orogeny and Cenozoic collisional orogeny, becoming the core of the collisional orogeny belt in Tibet. The Lhasa terrane experienced not only land-land collision between the India and Eurasian continent in the early Cenozoic but also experienced complicated geological processes such as southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethys ocean crust in the Mesozoic, northward subduction of the Yarlung Zangbo Tethys ocean crust and Lhasa-Qiangtang collision in the early Baimo period in the late Jurassic. The Lhasa terrane has experienced this complex tectonic-magmatism history, making it an active area for mineralizing fluids' activation, migration, and enrichment. Its geological conditions are very favorable and it is considered as an important strategic mineral resource succession base in China.\nAccording to recent research, it has been found that the eastern part of the Yarlung Zangbo sutures in the Tibet Plateau is characterized by a new crust, on which a series of large-scale and super-large Cu-Au deposits are developed, which are pretty different from other terranes with an ancient basement. Here, Pb-Zn-Mo-Fe and other metallogenesis are the main features (Hou and Wang, 2008). This zoning of mineralization probably implies that the nature of the crust (new or old crust) controls the mineralization (Hou et al., 2013). Limited data reveal that there is also a new crust near the Bangong-Nujiang sutures in the western Qiangtan (Zhu et al., 2013). In addition, the Gaerqiong, Galale and Balazza Cu-Au(Mo) deposits were newly discovered on it (Li et al., 2011), which means that there is a great potential for the development of Cu-Au deposits in the vicinity of the Bangong-Nujiang sutures, which has been less studied.\n\n\n3\nData sources and research methods\n\n3.1\nData sources\nThe data of this study, on the Tibet Plateau from 1995 to 2021, are collected from the published geological documents, Georoc database, Earthchem database by our team. More than 10,600 diagenetic and metallogenic geochemical data have been collected and a data sharing platform for the Tibet Plateau has been established. As shown in (Fig. 2\n), the data points are all distributed in the Tibet Plateau and the main mineral accumulation areas. According to ArcGIS standard deviation ellipse clustering analysis, the first-level standard deviation ellipse contains about 68% of the elements in the clustering, the second-level standard deviation ellipse contains about 95% of the elements in the clustering, and the third-level standard deviation ellipse contains about 99% of the elements in the clustering. The basic spatial pattern of the elements indicates that the data points are normally distributed from the center to the periphery, which can satisfy the metallogenic characteristics analysis on the metallogenic belt's spatial scale and the ore-accumulation area. This research combines geochemical data with GIS technology and uses various analysis methods for analysis and processing.\n\n\n3.2\nTechnology roadmap\nThe technical route of this paper is as follows:\n\n(1)\nConstruction of geochemical database of Tibet Plateau.\n\n\n\nSystematically collect and sort out relevant information in domestic and foreign public databases such as geological documents, Georoc database and Earthchem database published in the Tibetan Plateau from 1995 to 2021, study the construction strategy of a large database, and establish a data sharing platform for the Tibetan Plateau, in order to provide data support for the analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of geochemical data in the study area.\n\n(2)\nCharacteristics of geochemical elements in the Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\n\nZircon Hf isotope and whole rock Nd isotope can reflect the properties and characteristics of the geological body during its formation. When exploring the geological background, we can analyze the zircon Hf isotope and whole rock Nd isotope to speculate on the genesis of the rock. Isotopic characteristics can reflect the nature of the crust in time and space, analyze and map the isotopes, study their temporal and spatial distribution characteristics, explore the genesis of rocks, and then infer the nature of the crust in time and space and explore its characteristic law.\n\n(3)\nStudy on abnormal values of metallogenic related elements in Tibet Plateau.\n\n\n\nSome element anomalies in geochemical data can reflect the geological anomalies in the study area, and GIS mapping can be used to show the abnormal fluctuation range of metallogenic elements in space. Through geochemical mapping and abnormal value analysis, the variation range of metallogenic elements can be delineated, and then GIS analysis can be used to explore the specific fluctuation value of elements to speculate the metallogenic regional belt.\n\n(4)\nStudy on the correlation of symbiotic assemblage of geochemical elements in Tibet Plateau.\n\n\n\nGeochemical elements are similar in geological mineralization, and there will be chain reactions between different elements. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze the combination reaction between geochemical elements. Exploring the symbiotic relationship of elements can further inverse the formation of deposits. Therefore, using multivariate statistical analysis to study the symbiotic combination of geochemical elements can explore and inverse the geological and metallogenic process and further analyze its genetic relationship.\n(5) GIS metallogenic prediction in Tibet Plateau.\nThrough the analysis of the spatial coordinates, element content, geological age, mineralization type information and other factors of the geochemical data of the Tibetan Plateau, the relationship between the characteristics of ore controlling factors and mineralization law can be discussed from the perspective of spatial and attribute data characteristics and combined with GIS Spatio-temporal aggregation analysis. Based on the above analysis results, combined with the geological characteristics of regional favorable mineralization, several favorable metallogenic targets are delineated and the favorable factors of the target are analyzed.\n\n\n3.3\nIsotope analysis method\nIsotope technology has developed rapidly in recent years, and isotope dating and geochemical tracing are widely used in geological studies. Previous studies present that the value of 176Hf\/177Hf can be used to indicate the property characteristics of zircon during its formation (Wu et al., 2007). Therefore, the zircon Hf isotope analysis provides an important basis for exploring the origin of rocks (Wang et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015). The nature of the earth's crust can be inferred from time and space by analysis of the zircon Hf isotope (Yan et al., 2015). Zircon Hf is an objective average isotope of a sample (Wang et al., 2017), which is conducive to isotope mapping over a wide range and has good comparability in different regions (Griffin et al., 2002). The Nd isotope of the whole rock is also widely used. It can trace the magmatic source area's characteristics and estimate the source area's model age (Wang et al., 2009). Therefore, in isotope mapping and tracing, Nd and Hf isotopes are coupled to a certain extent (Du et al., 2016). It is better to combine Nd and Hf isotopes to further study the geological characteristics of the area.\nIsotope data are used to determine whether the magma originated from the remelting of old and mature crustal material or from the partial melting of new crustal material. The crustal properties (new or old and mature crust) of the magma source area are determined by the zircon Hf isotope, and then the metallogenic regularity is analyzed according to the crustal properties. Regional isotope mapping can generally be divided into two expression modes: one is to distinguish the difference of isotope values (e.g. \u03b5\nHf(t) value, \u03b5\nNd(t) value and mode age value) of rock mass and characterize its attributes by directly using different colors in geological mapping; On the other hand, the equivalent points are analyzed directly in geological mapping for plotting (e.g. contour maps). The combination of the two methods can improve the accuracy of analysis (Hou and Wang, 2018).\n\n\n3.4\nMultivariate statistical analysis\nThis research has constructed the geochemical database of the Tibet Plateau, and the database could be processed by SPSS (Statistical Product and Service solutions). SPSS software is a software with complete statistical functions integrating data entry, data editing, data management, statistical analysis and graph drawing (Zhou et al., 2016), which can carry out complex multivariate statistical analysis on geochemical data such as correlation analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and regression analysis (Zhao et al., 2016).\nMultivariate statistical analysis is a method to study the law of combinations of geochemical elements by means of mathematical statistics. Geochemical properties of elements often show similarities in specific geological processes. This similarity can be used to carry out reasonable element combinations and invert similar geological processes through element combinations. It is of great significance to further understand the formation of mineral deposits (Wang et al., 2020b). Relevant analysis, cluster analysis and factor analysis are the main methods of multivariate statistical analysis (Yan et al., 2021). Therefore, this paper studies the symbiotic association relationship of geochemical elements in this area through these methods and further analyses their genetic connections.\n\n\n3.5\nAnalysis of geochemical element abnormal\nIn geological mineralization, metallogenic anomalies are usually caused by the large-scale accumulation of metallogenic elements. Through the analysis of Abnormal Value, various mineralization related elements in the Tibetan Plateau can be mapped, and the element value special points can be visually displayed by combining GIS. The anomaly values can clearly show the special conditions of some geochemical data (Zhao and Meng, 1993; Zhu, 2006), showing anomalous fluctuation areas of metallogenic elements on mapping by the anomaly, thus estimating the metallogenic zone. The principal of extracting regional geochemical anomalies is to separate background values from abnormal values by calculating the lower limit of anomalies. The division of anomaly lower threshold for ore-forming elements is directly related to the analysis and extraction of ore-forming anomalies. There are many ways to analyze and extract geochemical anomalies (determine the lower limit). The conventional geostatistical method is usually used, which calculates the lower limit by doubling the standard deviation. The theory comes from the two sigma principle of normal distribution. Most of the abnormal values may be closely related to mineralization activities. Through these connections, we can tap the metallogenic potential in the study area, draw the abnormal fluctuation range of relevant elements, and speculate on the metallogenic accumulation area (Yang et al., 2019).\n\n\n3.6\nGIS spatial analysis\nGIS efficient data management system can effectively process geochemical data, while GIS spatial analysis method can explore the Spatio-temporal characteristics of data and its influencing factors (Wang et al., 2020c). Therefore, based on the perspective of pattern evolution (Zhang and Xiao, 2020), the Spatio-temporal attributes of data such as spatial location, element data, geological age and information on metallogenic types can be used to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the spatial\u2013temporal aggregation characteristics of GIS metallogenesis (Chen et al., 2011), and then to explore the relationship between the metallogenic pattern and the distribution of ore-controlling characteristics (Li, 2019; Xiang et al., 2019). The GIS spatial analysis methods used in this paper include standard deviation ellipse, spatial autocorrelation, spatial clustering feature analysis, buffer spatial neighborhood analysis, etc. This will provide a perspective window for the excavation of spatial distribution characteristics of mineralization and redundant and tedious expression of geological theory in the Tibet Plateau area, facilitate further integration of existing Spatio-temporal data resources, deepen recognition of spatial distribution of mineralization in the Tibet Plateau area, and provide indicative analysis for Cu and Au multi-metal prospecting.\n\n\n\n4\nResearch on spatio-temporal distribution of isotope data\n\n4.1\nIsotope mapping and characteristics\nPrevious studies have shown that Hf and Nd isotope mapping can delineate the spatial distribution of crustal blocks (new\/old crust) in different mineralization systems or mineralization belts (Wang et al., 2015b), and reveal the deep crustal structure composition, regional mineralization capacity and development space of mineralization system (Wang et al., 2015a). The control of crustal block type on classification and spatial distribution of deposit types is the first controlling factor. According to Hf and Nd isotope mapping results, the prospecting strategic target area can be quickly determined (Yang et al., 2017a).\nBy systematically analyzing the zircon Hf and the whole rock Nd isotopic composition, the source rock composition characteristics and crustal model age (T\nDM\nc) were determined (Wang et al., 2020d), and then the magmatic zircon \u03b5\nHf(t), whole rock \u03b5\nNd(t) and T\nDM\nc contour maps were made (Zhang et al., 2013), as shown in (Fig. 3\n, Fig. 4\n, Fig. 5\n). Based on the zircon \u03b5\nHf(t), whole rock \u03b5\nNd(t) and T\nDM\nc values, the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of different crustal blocks are deduced. Major polymetallic deposits are also included in these maps to show the spatial relationship of different deposits to specific geological features.\nThe Tibetan Plateau can be roughly divided into three parts: the northern part (East Qiangtang Terrane, Songpan-Ganzi Terrane), the central part (West Qiangtang Terrane and Lhasa Terrane) and the southern part (Himalayan Terrane), as shown in (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5), which have different \u03b5\nHf(t), \u03b5\nNd(t) and T\nDM\nc values: The \u03b5\nHf(t) and \u03b5\nNd(t) values in the terrane area north of the Jinsha sutures are from \u221214 to \u22122 and \u221212 to 0, and the corresponding T\nDM\nc values are relatively old. The central Qiangtang terrane has a relatively high \u03b5\nHf(t) value, high \u03b5\nNd(t) value and low T\nDM\nc age. The east side of the Lhasa terrane has a high \u03b5\nHf(t) value, high \u03b5\nNd(t) value and low T\nDM\nc value, and the west side has a low \u03b5\nHf(t) value, low \u03b5\nNd(t) value and high T\nDM\nc. In contrast, most areas of the Himalayan terrane south of the southern Yarlung Zangbo sutures have high \u03b5\nHf(t), high \u03b5\nNd(t) and low T\nDM\nc values.\nBased on zircon Hf isotopic mapping of the Tibetan Plateau, it is found that the metallogenic system in the study area is strictly controlled by the crustal attributes of different blocks, and the difference in crustal attributes controls the distribution of different ore-forming elements (Zheng et al., 2021). Firstly, almost all Cu and Au deposits are located in the region of the new crust on the south side of the central Lhasa terrane and the west side of the West Qiangtang terrane (Gangdis porphyry Cu belt is located in the southeast section of the Lhasa terrane; Bangong-Nujiang porphyry Cu belt is located in the northwest section of Lhasa terrane and the junction of the Qiangtang terrane). Especially the deposits of Cu-Au deposits in Lhasa terrane are spatially within a magmatic arc, in which the zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) values and the whole rock \u03b5\nNd(t) values are the largest, which is similar to the isotopic characteristics of the depleted mantle and has the smallest T\nDM\nc ages. The northwest side of the Lhasa terrane and the boundary of the West Qiangtang terrane near the Bangong-Nujiang sutures also have the largest zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) value, which is similar to the isotopic characteristics of the deformed mantle and has the smallest T\nDM\nc age. According to the existing data and mapping results, the new crust generally has a higher \u03b5\nHf(t) value of zircons and a smaller T\nDM\nc age, and the distribution range of Cu and Au deposits is basically controlled by the new crust materials (Hou et al., 2013).\nIsotope mapping within the region, as an age-constrained exploration method, can not only detect the material structure of the orogenic belt and lithosphere as a whole, but also profoundly reveal the metallogenic process and regional metallogenic regularity, and hopefully develop into a new metallogenic prediction method (Wang et al., 2015b). It should be noted that fine isotope mapping using large-scale high-density isotope data is costly and difficult at this stage, however this study shows that low-density mapping can still provide information about the nature, composition, structure, diagenesis and metallogenesis of the crust and can be used to delineate the metallogenic target areas.\nIn data processing, abnormally high or abnormally low values in the data are removed(For example, a sample in the Cuoqin area has zircon of \u221220.4\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22122.7 \u03b5\nHf(t) value, the minimum value of \u221220.4 is removed in data processing in this paper). This is because there are very small or large zircons in an area during ArcGIS mapping \u03b5\nHf(t) value will seriously affect the adjacent areas without data point control, and then affect the final judgment. Finally, the spatial distribution characteristics of the crustal properties of the Tibetan Plateau can be revealed macroscopically by checking and processing the generated maps and adding relevant geological contents.\n\n\n4.2\nCharacteristics of multivariate statistical analysis\nBased on geochemical data of various elements in the area, according to correlation analysis and field investigation, and combined with general rules of element combination of multi-type Cu-Au polymetallic deposits, elements with good indicative effect on Cu and Au mineralization are selected, element geochemical anomaly characteristics are determined, element anomaly distribution is analyzed, and metallogenic potential is determined (Zhou et al., 2016). According to the analysis of geological conditions and element combinations in the study area, 12 elements have large dispersion and differentiation degrees and have different enrichment centers. Cu, Mo, Zn, Pb, Co, Sn, Ni, Mg, Au, Ag, As and W are the better indicative elements in the Cu-Au polymetallic deposits.\nThe correlation analysis of 12 elements after logarithmic transformation and standardization is carried out by SPSS software (Huang et al., 2020). As shown in (Table 1\n), the correlation coefficient between Cu and Mo, Zn, Pb and Au is more than 0.6, which indicates that Cu has a good correlation with these elements. Elements with good correlation may have some internal relationship in origin and cause. Among the 12 elements analyzed, Cu has the closest relationship with Mo, followed by Cu with Au, and Zn with Pb, which is basically consistent with the association relationship of the mineralizing elements in this area. In the known ore bodies in the study area, Cu always closely coexists with Mo, Au, Pb and Zn. At the same time, these elements are also characteristic element combinations of interlayer oxidation minerals far from the contact zone.\nUsing SPSS software, R-factor analysis (Dong et al., 2008) was carried out on the data of the study area, and finally, a load matrix with maximum variance of rotation factor was obtained. As shown in (Table 2\n), there are a total of five major factors representing five element combination types in the study area, namely, F1 factor (Cu, Mo, Au); F2 factor (Zn, Pb, Mg); F3 factor (Ni, As); F4 factor (Co, Ag, W); F5 Factor (Sn). The variance contribution rate of F1 factor combination is 23.99%, which is the most important element combination type in the research area. By comparing the results of factor analysis, it can be concluded that the combination of Cu-Au-Mo elements is the most critical mineralization indicator element combination in the study area, which directly indicates the existence of Cu-Au deposits. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on summarizing and evaluating the anomalous characteristics of such combinations in order to explore the metallogenic conditions.\nThe data of 12 elements are standardized by SPSS, and then the R-type cluster analysis is carried out on the element indexes by using the system cluster method (Dong et al., 2008). As shown in (Fig. 6\n), the R-type cluster analysis pedigree of the research area is obtained. When distance coefficient 20 is taken as the classification standard, 12 elements can be divided into three groups. The first one is the combination of Cu, Mo, Zn, Au, Pb and Sn. The second category is Mg, As, Co, Ag and W. Ni are classified separately. Among them, Cu, Au and Mo elements constitute characteristic indicative elements of Cu-Au-Mo mineralization in the study area. This is the indicator element combination of main metallogenic activities in the study area. The coexistence of elements (anomalies) such as Cu, Mo and Au is related to Cu-Au-Mo mineralization. Sometimes it is accompanied by elements such as Pb, Zn, Sn, Ag and W, which are the main indicators for finding Cu-Au-Mo deposits. Therefore, according to the results of correlation analysis and cluster analysis, the correlation of elements such as Cu, Mo, Zn, Au, Pb and Sn is the best, which is the main indication for looking for Cu-Au deposits.\n\n\n4.3\nCharacteristics of geochemical element anomalies\nGeochemical anomaly mapping results have certain regularity, which is of guiding significance to geotectonic research and mineral exploration (Liu and Zhou, 2019), and can provide basis for exploring why element distribution is affected by fault zone and sutures. Although the fault zone is closed, some chemical elements remain on both sides of the sutures, representing plate movements. According to the geochemical mapping of various elements by predecessors, two-thirds of the elements show abnormal zones with high or low content along the sutures.\nAccording to the analysis results in the previous section, the geochemical area of copper-philic elements is characterized by the high content of elements such as Au, Zn, Mo and Pb. Generally, the geochemical area of copper-philic elements is consistent with the metallogenic belt, so to a certain extent, this corresponding relationship can reflect the abundance of metallogenic elements (Wang et al., 2020a). It also reflects the geochemical element combination of geological bodies and the genetic relationship between the deposit type and the ore belt formed. In this paper, Au, Zn and Mo elements showing the best correlation with Cu are selected for analysis. As shown in (Fig. 7\n, Fig. 8\n, Fig. 9\n), according to the mass fraction diagram of Au, Zn and Mo, the concentration area of Cu mineralization near the suture zone coincides with part of the high-value anomaly area of element mapping. The three element anomalies are mainly distributed in the South and northwest of the study area, generally in NW-direction beads and locally in an island shape, all of which have apparent anomalous concentration zoning, which has good adaptability and correlation and are consistent with the results of correlation analysis. The anomalous aggregation form of each element is obvious and has several aggregation centers. The anomalous aggregation centers are mostly located in the developed geological structure, which is conducive to mineralization.\n\n\n4.4\nSpatial clustering characteristics\nThrough the analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of mineralization in the Tibet Plateau with data-driven and GIS technology, combined with the field comparison of existing metallogenic belts and ore concentration areas, this paper uses GIS analysis means to explore the temporal and spatial distribution of various polymetallic deposits, and reveals the importance of GIS scientific prospecting, which can provide data help and support for the delineation of metallogenic research areas in the future.\n\n(1)\nStandard deviation ellipse and mean center.\n\n\n\nBy analyzing the ArcGIS standard deviation ellipse in the whole range, the direction standard deviation ellipse and average center are applied to obtain the metallogenic accumulation trend of magmatic rocks. As shown in (Fig. 10\n), the analysis results show obvious differences in the spatial distribution of deposits in the global scope. The long and short axis ratios of the standard deviation ellipse in the western section of Bangong Lake metallogenic belt are large, showing a NEE trend. At the same time, the ratio in the eastern part of the Lhasa terrane is the largest, showing a NW trend.\n\n(2)\nSpatial autocorrelation.\n\n\n\nIn this paper, the Moran value is used to evaluate spatial autocorrelation. The global Moran I statistics are used for analysis through the spatial coordinates and attribute characteristics of the data. Its principle is to evaluate the spatial autocorrelation of the position and element value of the data through systematic formula operation. Firstly, obtain the spatial coordinates and attribute characteristics of a data group, then analyze and determine whether the data mode is aggregation, discrete, or random. The analysis results will generate three values, namely Moran I index value, Z evaluation value and P value, which are mainly used to determine the data mode. Where p value is the approximate value of area calculated from known data (limited by test statistics) (Wang et al., 2020c).\nBased on the known ore occurrence data in the study area, starting from the global scale, the spatial autocorrelation is applied to explore the metallogenic accumulation of magmatic rocks. As shown in (Fig. 11\n), the p value is less than 0.01, the Z value is greater than 1.96, and the significance level test of the Moran value is significant. From the results of spatial autocorrelation analysis, the ore occurrences in the whole range of the Tibet Plateau show high aggregation characteristics in spatial distribution.\n\n(3)\nMulti distance spatial clustering.\n\n\n\nUsing multi-distance spatial clustering analysis, quantify the scale of accumulation of ore-forming rock mass, and use the nuclear density map to obtain the location, shape and size of spatial accumulation of ore-forming rock mass, and then analyze the evolution characteristics of ore-forming core from the perspective of space\u2013time (Wang et al., 2020c). As shown in (Fig. 12\n), the metallogenic accumulation center is mainly divided into two parts, the southern Lhasa terrane and the West Qiangtang terrane are the main ore body concentration areas, which are in line with the previous analysis.\n\n\n\n5\nRsesults and discussion\n\n5.1\nGeological change and the influence of fault zone\nThe study shows that the Cenozoic crust provides more Cu, Au and other ore-forming elements for ore-rich magma (Zhang and Hou, 2021). From northeast to southwest in the study area, with the change of crustal characteristics, the type of mineralization has also changed, which may be that the new and old degree of the crust has played a vital role in controlling the type of mineralization. In recent years, researchers have found a positive correlation between the zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) value and the grade and scale of porphyry Cu deposits (Zhu et al., 2012). Through this law, the metallogenic potential of the area can be further analyzed.\nCenozoic is an intraplate active period, producing magma belts and fault basin bottom, which are very beneficial to the mineralization of Cu, Au, Mo, Zn, etc. Plate structure controls regional mineralization. The suture zones and deep and large fault zones spread from east to West in the study area are the specific manifestations of plate movement (Xu et al., 2011), which significantly control hydrothermal metallic deposits such as Cu, Au, Mo, Zn. The mineral spots found in the area can prove that the complex junction position of the side of the fault and the fault zone is very favorable for the mineralization and is the main structural condition for controlling the deposit. The spatial position of the deposits is shown in (Fig. 13\n). The large-scale metal deposits in the area are all related to deep-seated faults. ArcGIS is used for the nearest neighbor analysis and the distance calculated between the ore spots and regional fault zones. It is found that the polymetallic deposits of copper, gold and molybdenum are mainly concentrated in the southern part of the Lhasa terrane and beside the fracture of the West Qiangtang terrane.\nAs mentioned above, the southern part of the Lhasa terrane is dominated by new crust and the distribution of fault zones is obvious (Hou and Wang, 2018), which indicates a significant metallogenic potential of Cu and Au around this area. At the same time, zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) values and crustal model ages in the West Qiangtang Terrane are similar to those in the Yarlung Zangbo fault zone in the Lhasa Terrane, which indicates that this area is also the most potential Cu-Au metallogenic area. In other areas, Cu metallogenic potential may be relatively low due to no obvious changes in geological characteristics. Therefore, the South of Lhasa terrane and the West of Qiangtang terrane are the most potential Cu-Au metallogenic belts compared with other areas.\n\n\n5.2\nPrediction of metallogenic areas\nThrough the functions of GIS buffer analysis and superposition analysis, the influence of fault structure can be quickly analyzed. Polymetallic metallogenic enrichment area is closely related to the change of geological structure, so fault zone and suture zone are important factors in exploring regional mineralization. GIS buffer analysis and superposition analysis can be used to explore the geological influencing factors of the study area through geostatistics. Therefore, through the neighborhood analysis function of GIS, the buffer zone analysis can be carried out on the fault zone, suture zone and element content data points, and the optimal parameter distance range is set to 10\u00a0km. Then, through the superposition analysis function of GIS and selecting the spatial link tool, 4650 data points within 10\u00a0km of the fault zone can be obtained, As shown in (Fig. 14\n).\nThrough the GIS nearest neighbor analysis function, a distance distribution map between the cumulative frequency of ore points and the fault distance is generated and the fault structure's ore control distance field is explored. As shown in (Fig. 15\n), through the analysis of the spatial location characteristics of the fault, it can be seen that 40% of the data points are mainly located in the interval of the starting value of equal distance [5,10]. 50% of the data points are located in the high value area of fault intersection within 10\u00a0km in space. 70% of the data points are located in the centrosymmetric area of the suture zone within 15\u00a0km, and the data point concentration interval within the excellent benefit interval of mineralization is [4,10]. Therefore, equidistant intervals [5,10] and 10\u00a0km buffer zone will be used as metallogenic prediction factors.\nAccording to isotope mapping and GIS analysis, the core of the metallogenic belt is located near the mineral concentration area beside the suture zone and fault zone. Taking the ore-controlling elements Cu and Au as examples, around zircon Hf and whole rock Nd isotopic analysis of space, based on the orientation mapping of existing Cu, Au, Zn and Mo polymetallic deposits and mineralization core, combined with the multivariate statistical analysis and element anomaly map characteristics above, the higher range of metallogenic possibility is drawn by ArcGIS superposition analysis and buffering analysis, and the prospecting prediction area is drawn according to the scale of metallogenic accumulation, thus the prospecting prediction map is obtained. Three prospective areas with certain prospecting potential have been delineated as shown in (Fig. 16\n), numbered I, \u2161 and III.\nThe prospective area I: The study area is located in the southeast of the Lhasa terrane. Large EW-trending fault structures in the area provide a good migration channel and favorable storage space for ore-bearing hydrothermal migration. The element anomaly value at the intersection of faults is high. The \u03b5\nHf(t) value and the \u03b5\nNd(t) value are highly positive. The predicted target area has prominent copper\u2013gold mixing characteristics, and it is a favorable location for prospecting Cu-Au polymetallic deposits.\nThe prospective area \u2161: Located in the south-central direction of the research area and in the South of the Lhasa terrane, there are mainly EW-trending fault structures developed in the area. The Cu and Au content in the prospecting prediction area on both sides of the fault is high, with the highest \u03b5\nHf(t) value, \u03b5\nNd(t) value and minimum T\nDM\nc age. The Cu-Au association is the most obvious, and it is the most favorable position for prospecting Cu-Au polymetallic deposits in Tibet Plateau.\nThe prospective area III: Located in the northwest of the research area and West of West Qiangtang terrane, \u03b5\nHf(t) value and \u03b5\nNd(t) value have an apparent high value accumulation center. The elements Au, Zn and Mo have a good anomaly combination, large anomaly area and similar shape, but the correlation between Cu and Au is slightly weak. This area is a favorable area for prospecting for separate Cu and Au deposits.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBased on GIS analysis combined with geochemical data and mapping analysis of Hf and Nd isotope data, this paper made prospecting analysis and prediction in the study area and drew the following conclusions:\n\n(1)\nThe high \u03b5Hf(t) values and \u03b5Nd(t) values and low TDMc ages on both sides of the suture zone and fault zone of the southern Lhasa terrane and the West Qiangtang terrane in the Tibetan Plateau constrain the spatial distribution of ore-forming elements. Three prospective areas with Cu and Au prospecting potential have been divided according to the comprehensive metallogenic characteristics. It has important reference significance for exploring Cu and Au deposits in the Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\n(2)\nGIS analysis technology combined with regional analysis of high geochemical element content and ore distribution can obtain different levels of favorable prospecting areas, providing an important reference for prospecting multi-metal deposits such as Cu, Au, Mo and Zn in the metallogenic belt.\n\n\n(3)\nAt present, the development of data technology is more and more rapid. With the rapid development of analytical techniques and the wide application of high-end analytical instruments, isotope data will be obtained more effectively and mapping costs will be reduced. Therefore, isotope analysis is a feasible and effective method to quickly delineate the prospecting strategic target area. Geochemical element and isotope mapping can provide strong support for modern prospecting prediction.\n\n\n\n\n","12":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGeothermal anomaly refers to the region with high enthalpy, which is characterized by widely distributed hot springs. The RAMs have been termed \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cstrategic\u201d resources due to their importance and potential geopolitical risk with respect to energy supply (Chakhmouradian et al., 2015; Elshkaki and Shen, 2019). Increased attention has been given to the mechanism of RAM enrichment to meet the mineral demand and enhance exploration (Benson et al., 2017). The RAMs are concentrated in the magma during melting and fractional crystallization and are ultimately enriched in magmatic volatiles due to their highly incompatible nature (Bradley et al., 2017). RAMs deposits occur primarily in orogenic pegmatites, evaporated saline brines, and clays adjacent to RAM-enriched source rocks. However, it is unclear how these RAM-enriched magmatic volatiles that are buried deep in the crust were brought to the surface in a short time without volcanic eruption. The study of hydrothermal circulation of hot springs can be a successful approach to address questions concerning the migration and enrichment of RAMs from a great depth and explore the strategic resources.\nAs a part of the Mediterranean-Himalayan geothermal belt, southern Tibet is one of the most active geothermal regions in the world. It displays extreme enrichments in RAM elements in hot springs, especially in the Yadong-Gulu rift (YGR) (Tan et al., 2018; Su et al., 2020). The YGR is famous for its abnormal geothermal field and RAM-enriched hot springs that are hotly debated deep magmatic-hydrothermal solutions (Feng et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, the partial melting magma is deeply buried in the present middle crust (Kind et al., 1996). No RAM-enriched pegmatite or host rocks are adjacent to the hot springs (Su et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2015). Furthermore, the time of water-rock reaction is short due to quick circulation recharge from glacier melting (Tan et al., 2014). Obviously, the circulation depth and area of groundwater will determine whether the deep RAM-enriched fluids can be brought to the hot springs. Helium isotopes from hot springs reveal that hydrothermal fluid circulation has ascended from great depths and essentially from magmatic bodies (Zhang et al., 2017a). The boundary detaching faults of the rifts are considered to penetrate deep into the crust or mantle layers (Zhang et al., 2013); however, it is not obvious in seismic profile images (Alsdorf et al., 1998). Generally, faults can provide pathways for hydrothermal fluid circulation and leaching of mineral elements. However, the depth that hydrothermal circulation could reach in this postcollisional rift and how such circulation is influenced by deep structures remain ambiguous. This ambiguity will inevitably lead to indeterminacy of the relationship between the hydrothermal circulation of hot springs and RAM-enriched partial melts of the mid-crust (Chen et al., 1996; Wei et al., 2001). In addition, uncertainty also occurs on the variation of the RAM concentrations in different springs located in the same rift (Su et al., 2020). This research will aid efforts to find causes and guide the exploration of hydrothermal metallogenic systems.\nHere, we investigate the possible structure of the YGR and track the pathways of hydrothermal circulation using a two-dimensional numerical model. We aim to examine whether the discharge of high-temperature fluids at the rift can be derived from magmas through mid-crustal partial melting. This study verifies the depths of detachment faults and reconstructs the RAM enrichment and metallogenic process of geothermal springs.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nA series of prominent, nearly north\u2013south-trending rifts have developed in the colliding Tibetan Plateau indicating large-scale crustal extension (Kapp et al., 2005; Tapponnier et al., 1981). This development has been attributed to the accommodation of large-scale strike-slip and thrust faulting (Armijo et al., 1986) or gravity collapse induced by the fluid-like behavior of partially molten middle crust based on seismic and magnetotelluric analysis (Brown et al., 1996; Cogan et al., 1998). Another possibility may be related to local mantle upwelling induced by a tear in the subducting slab according to high-resolution P and S tomography images (Li and Song, 2018; Liu et al., 2020). Rift-stage magmatism is characterized by the mid-Miocene ultrapotassic and potassic volcanic rocks, adakitic intrusive rocks, calc-alkaline granites and leucogranites (Chung et al., 2005; Zheng et al 2016). As one of the typical rifts, the YGR is located in southern Tibet and is separated by the Yarlung-Zangbo River into southern and northern parts (Fig. 1\n). The rift is bounded by steeply dipping (45\u00b0-60\u00b0) planar normal faults, which truncate or displace moraines and alluvium with triangularly faceted mountain fronts and fault-line scarps in the field (Armijo et al., 1986). The boundary fault zone of the northern YGR is several hundred meters thick and marked by a ductile high strain zone dipping gently to the southeast in the central Nyainqentanglha Mountains, indicating several tens of kilometers of extension (Cogan et al., 1998). Similar ductile high-strain zones exhibiting normal-sense shear also occur locally in the southern YGR (Harrison et al., 1995). The INDEPTH deep reflection profile of the YGR shows a thin Quaternary graben fill with a thickness of generally less than a few hundred meters thick and an undulatory band of reflections marked as the mid-crustal partial-melt zone at depths from 12\u00a0km to 18\u00a0km (Alsdorf et al., 1998). A \u201ccore complex-type\u201d extension with a detachment fault down to the partial-melt zone has been suggested (Cogan et al., 1998; Kapp et al., 2005; Weller et al., 2016) and may even displace the Moho across the YGR (Tian et al., 2015). Relocated hypocenters and focal mechanisms support extensional activity occurring at depths in the range of 10\u201315\u00a0km (Baur, 2007; Tian et al., 2015). Presently, the rift is still active with frequent earthquakes (Liu et al., 2012) and the rift has been extending at rates of 1.3\u20136\u00a0mm\/yr since the late Quaternary (Chevalier et al., 2020).\nThe northern YGR is characterized by a semiarid, plateau meadow climate with elevations in the range of 4200\u20135500\u00a0m and a mean annual air temperature of 1-5\ufeff \u00b0C. In contrast, the shallow reservoir of the northern YGR is in the range of 125\u2013170\u00a0\u00b0C at a depth of 200\u00a0m, and deep reservoir temperatures are in the range of 240\u2013330 \ufeff\u00b0C at a depth of 1000 in the Yangbajing region (Guo et al., 2007). The atmospheric pressure ranges from 0.5 to 0.6\u00a0atm, and the average annual rainfall is approximately 300\u00a0mm (Fan, 2002; Yuan et al., 2014). The hot springs of the YGR are enriched in RAMs ranging from 1 to 48\u00a0mg\/L (Zhang, 2016), which is several to ten times higher than most geothermal springs of magmatic reservoirs worldwide (Michard, 1990; Sanjuan et al., 2014). The mineralization of the geothermal system is very young, approximately 0.5\u00a0Ma (Hou et al., 2001; Su et al., 2020). The Cs contents of sinters exceed 700 ug\/g at Gulu and 170 ug\/g at the Ningzhong site, which have exceeded the scope of the available industrial grade (Su et al., 2020). The RAM contents of hot springs in the rift are not consistent, indicating their different sources. Magmatic fluids and water-rock interactions are still debated as origins and enrichment mechanisms in these geothermal mineralization systems (Wang et al., 2019). The RAM concentrations seem to be correlated with temperature and vary with time, such as Li changes in hot springs and depositional travertines (Fig. 2\n). Notably, RAMs are not obviously enriched in the country rocks of the research area, especially in metamorphic rocks, and the contents of Li, Rb, and Cs are much lower than the average values of the upper crust (Su et al., 2020).\nThe deep structure across the Ningzhong rift of the YGR is determined based on seismic reflections (Alsdorf et al., 1998) and the surface geology of the research area (Fig. 3\n). F1 represents the boundary fault of the rift, and the others faults are subfaults. The bright spots at depth in the seismic profile are interpreted as magmas, whereas a similar reflection at 10\u00a0km below the surface is inferred as magma or a ductile detachment fault. Faults F7 and F8 are inferred to connect to the boundary fault. Whether the boundary fault penetrates the partial-melt magma in the middle crust and transports heat to the surface is uncertain, although earthquakes occur around or deeper than the partial-melt zone in the YGR. Therefore, we define the different depths of faults and magmas to verify each other and to discuss the hydrothermal circulation process.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe hydrothermal circulation and transport flow are simulated numerically using the finite element method implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics software by coupling heat transfer and fluid flow equations. All models simulate coupled water and heat flow in a single-phase state. A similar numerical method can be obtained in previous research (Taillefer et al., 2018).\n\n3.1\nGoverning equations\nThe model is defined with porous and permeable media for the faults, reservoir and basement, which obey conservation laws. The heat transfer equation is:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c1\nC\np\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n\n=\n\u2207\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\u00b7\n\n\u2207\n\u2192\n\n\u00b7\nT\n\n\n\n-\n\n\u03c1\nL\n\n\nC\nL\n\n\u00b7\n\nu\n\u2192\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u2207\n\u2192\n\n\u00b7\nT\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nu\n\u2192\n\n is the Darcy velocity, t is time and T is temperature. \u03c1, Cp\n and \u03bb are the density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity of the saturated porous medium, respectively. \u03c1\nL\n is the fluid density, and CL\n is the fluid-specific heat. Darcy\u2019s law describes fluid motion:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nu\n\u2192\n\n=\n\n-\n\nk\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\u2192\n\n\np\n-\n-\n\n\n\u03c1\nL\n\n\n\ng\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere k, \n\u03bc\n, p and g are the permeability of the medium, fluid viscosity, pressure and acceleration of gravity, respectively. The fluid is incompressible and the mass conservation equation is written:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u2207\n\u00b7\n\nu\n\u2192\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coupling between heat transfer and fluid motion occurs through the velocity field in Eqs. (1), (2) and (3). The fluid density and dynamic viscosity depend on temperature as follows:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nL\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n=\n1002.4\n-\n-\n0.1905\nT\n-\n0.0025\n\nT\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nT\n\n\n=\n2\n.\n\n41410\n\n-\n5\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nexp\n\n\n\n570\n\nT\n+\n133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere density \u03c1\nL\n (kg\/m3) and dynamic viscosity\u03bc (Pa s) follow the values employed by geothermal researchers (Guillou-frottier et al., 2013; Rabinowicz et al., 1998).\n\n\n3.2\nGeometries and boundary conditions\nWe construct a 2D structure profile across the Ningzhong region of the northern YGR based on the morphology and geological interpretation (Fig. 3). The upper surface of the model corresponds to the realistic topography of a digital elevation model with a 50-m resolution (Fig. 4\n). Three kinds of simulations are conducted according to deep faults and magmatic activity (Table 1\n).\nModel 1: Shallow detachment fault and magma with different fault permeabilities.\nModel 2: Changing fault and magma.\nModel 3: Magma source.\nThe length and depth of the model are 60\u00a0km and nearly 20\u00a0km, respectively. The boundary detachment fault of the rift extends to a depth of 10\u00a0km along the top of the partial-melt zone of magma in the middle crust (Fig. 2). Synthetic and antithetic faults are defined according to the geological section and are connected to the boundary fault at a greater depth. The boundary fault is set to a width of 240\u00a0m, whereas the subfaults are 40\u00a0m in width. A polygonal mesh grid is constructed over the entire geometry. The mesh is refined around topographic complexities, fault planes and fault intersections. The smallest element size is 0.0101\u00a0km, and the maximum size is 2.99\u00a0km.\nThe permeability is estimated to be in the range of 5 \n\u00d7\n 10\u221214 m2 10\u221215 m2 in a large field (Fan, 2002). In our model, the sedimentary reservoir is assumed to have a constant permeability of 10\u221215 m2 (Zeng et al., 2014), and the basement is defined with a depth-dependent permeability according to a relation derived from hydraulic tests in a similar setting (Stober and Bucher, 2015).\n\n(6)\n\n\nl\no\ng\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n=\n-\n1.38\n\u00d7\nlog\n\n\ny\n\n\n-\n15.4\n\n\n\nwhere k is the permeability and y refers to the depth below the surface. The fault zones are investigated with constant permeabilities (10\u221213 m2, 10\u221214 m2 and 10\u221215 m2) in the models. The magma is assigned a permeability of 10\u221222 m2. For detailed parameters of the model, refer to Table 1.\nA linearly increased temperature from 0\u00a0\u00b0C to 5\u00a0\u00b0C is assigned at the surface according to elevations from 6300\u00a0m to 5200\u00a0m. The entire model is assumed to be fully saturated, and the water table is constrained by the topographic surface, which is considered valid to simulate regional flow in orogenic settings (Wanner et al., 2020). A hydrostatic pressure distribution and conductive geothermal gradient of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km are assigned throughout the initial model domain. The given geothermal gradient is lower than that of the present study area to test the effect of deep magma on the transient evolution of anomalous hot springs. Partial melting to produce magma is assumed to occur at 850\u00a0\u00b0C. Lateral and bottom boundaries are thermally insulated and impermeable. An elevation-dependent atmospheric pressure is imposed at the topographic surface:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\nP\n\natm\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n=\n\nP\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-\n\n\n0.006\ny\n\n\n288.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.255\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere P\n0\u00a0=\u00a0105 Pa is the atmospheric pressure at sea level and y is the elevation. A hydrostatic pressure gradient \u03c1.g is added to P\n0 below the surface topography. No flow is assigned to the lateral and basal boundaries.\n\n\n3.3\nSimulating the uptake of RAMs\nDilute material transport in porous media is coupled in the hydrothermal circulation simulator in terms of the source tracer. The magmatic fluid is assumed to be the source of RAMs. The release of RAMs from magmatic fluid determines their absorption into the hydrothermal circulation. The top of the magma beneath the boundary fault is fixed with a content of 5\u00a0mol\/m3 to define the amount of RAMs released during crystal fractionation of magma and water-rock interactions (Ni et al., 2017) (Lasaga, 1984). This design helps to determine the distribution of RAM anomalies controlled by deep magma in the research area.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nModel 1: Shallow detachment fault and magma with different fault permeabilities\nIn general, the strong impact of faults on hydrothermal circulation is related to their permeability. Therefore, a sensitivity study of fault permeability is conducted to evaluate the effect of faults on hydrothermal circulation. The permeability of faults F1-F8 is assigned values of 10\u221213, 10\u221214 and 10\u221215 m2 in Models 1\u20131, 1\u20132 and 1\u20133, respectively (Fig. 5\n). Fault F0 is not employed in this model and is assigned as the basement. Water infiltration occurs at high-elevation faults, and upward flow takes place along low-elevation rift faults, generating high-temperature thermal anomalies (Fig. 5). Water infiltrates quickly to reach the top of the partially melted magma in the high-permeability model (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013f) and more slowly in the moderate- and low-permeability models (Fig.\u00a05g\u2013l, m and m\u2013r). Ascending water is heated under deep thermal conditions and displays plumes when it reaches the sedimentary reservoir (Fig.\u00a05a and j). This phenomenon is obviously delayed in the moderate-permeability model (Fig.\u00a05j), while it is not distinct in the low-permeability model (Fig.\u00a05m\u2013r). The temperature varies greatly across the rift at a depth of 4.3\u00a0km above sea level (Fig. 6\n). The figure shows the high temperatures on faults F4-F6 with a maximum temperature of approximately 205\u00a0\u00b0C on fault F5 at 2000\u00a0yr and low temperatures on faults F1-F3 in model 1\u20131 (Fig.\u00a06a). In contrast, the temperatures of these three faults in Models 1\u20132 and 1\u20133 are lower than those of Models 1\u20131 before 10,000\u00a0yr (Fig.\u00a06a, c and e). At this time, the temperature on fault F5 is even lower than those on faults F4 and F6. The temperature increases quickly in the following stage and reaches 205\u00a0\u00b0C at 60,000\u00a0yr in Model 1\u20132 (Fig.\u00a06d), while it becomes the lowest temperature in Model 1\u20133 (Fig.\u00a06f). The temperatures on faults F5 and F6 in Model 1\u20132 reach the maximum range in Model 1\u20131 at a later stage; however, the temperature of fault F4 remains low in Models 1\u20132 and 1\u20133. This result is related to the flow direction of groundwater, where it turns from upward flow to downward flow along fault F4 at different stages (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d). The uppermost magma around fault F1 is cooled due to heat convection by groundwater circulation, while other parts of the magma are not obviously cooled.\n\n\n4.2\nModel 2: Changing faults and magma\nThis model is selected to test the effect of faults and magma. Therefore, we set a uniform fault permeability (10\u221213 m2), which helps to obtain a fast response during the circulation of geothermal groundwater. Faults F7 and F8 and the lower part of F4 in the basement are unset in Model 2\u20131 (Fig.\u00a07\na\u2013f). The upper magma at 6\u00a0km is not set in Models 2\u20131(Fig.\u00a07g\u2013l) and 2\u20133 (Fig.\u00a07m\u2013r). The F1 fault is assumed to extend along the top of the mid-crustal magma in Model 2\u20133.\nCompared with Model 1\u20131, the hydrothermal circulation changes in the absence of faults F7 and F8 and the lower part of F4 in Model 2\u20131 (Fig.\u00a07a\u2013f). The highest temperature occurs around the F3 fault, whereas the temperatures of other faults are low, especially for faults F4-F6 (Fig.\u00a08\na). The temperature is the same after 40,000\u00a0yr around F3 and F4, which is attributed to the flow charge from fault F3 to fault F4 in the shallow reservoir (Fig.\u00a08b). The deep magma has no obvious variation, indicating a limited effect of these subfaults on the cooling magma.\nThe magma at a certain depth has a limited effect on the upper hydrothermal circulation. The hydrothermal circulation is similar with or without the uppermost magma in both Model 1\u20131 and Model 2\u20132 (Fig.\u00a07g\u2013l and Fig.\u00a08c\u2013d). The fault along the top of magma does not facilitate the convection of groundwater. Therefore, magma cannot provide enough heat to springs without hydrothermal convection.\nWe extend fault F1 to the mid-crustal magma and design F0 as a fault; however, this configuration yields a result similar to that of Model 1\u20131 because the deep circulation is slow with a narrow fault at a great depth (not shown in the paper). We then enlarge the width of fault F1 at a great depth to simulate hydrothermal convection in Model 2\u20133 (Fig.\u00a07m\u2013r). This situation produces a higher temperature with a maximum of 260\u00a0\u00b0C around the F5 fault and lags 2000\u00a0yr compared with Model 1\u20131 (Fig.\u00a08e and f). In addition, the temperature around the F6 fault does not attain the degree of that in Model 1\u20131.\n\n\n4.3\nModel 3: Magma source\nRAMs are considered to originate partially from deep magma (Tan et al., 2014). The concentration of RAM is set to 5\u00a0mol\/m3 at the top of the magma along the base of the F1 fault. RAMs dissolve and flow upward in the hydrothermal circulation process. Models 3\u20131 and 3\u20132 simulate dilute matter transportation coupled with Models 1\u20131 and 2\u20131, respectively. The RAM content increases along faults F4-F6 and diffuses gradually into the upper reservoir in Model 3\u20131 (Fig.\u00a09\na\u2013h). Faults F7 and F8 and the lower part of F4 are assigned the basement in Model 3\u20132; thus, the migration pathway of RAM from the magma changes compared with Model 3\u20131 (Fig.\u00a09i\u2013o). In general, the dilute RAMs flow upward along faults and are distributed around the low-elevation region, which is consistent with the flow paths of hydrothermal circulation pathways (Fig. 9).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nHydrothermal anomalies controlled by the deep structure\nThe springs distributed in the YGR have different temperatures. The highest temperature (320\u00a0\u00b0C) occurs at Yangbajing due to sporadic magma chambers at shallow depths beneath the Nyainqentanglha Mountain (Dor, 2008). Shallow magma could doubtless provide heat to the surrounding country rocks; however, its extent is local. Many thermal anomalies along the rift are attributed to regional tectonics. We test the effect of these deep fault structures and deep magma heat sources on hydrothermal circulation with a normal geothermal gradient. Numerical simulations demonstrate that deep structures are one of the key factors controlling fluid pathways and thermal spring distributions. The deeper the circulation depth is, the higher the hot spring temperature, although the water takes more time to flow to the surface (Figs. 6 and 8). The temperatures of springs distributed in Qucai (north of Ningzhong) are 37\u201388 \u00b0C at the surface and 130\u2013160 \u00b0C in the reservoir (Li et al., 2015). A deep fault structure could produce a sufficiently high thermal anomaly without a heat source supplied by shallow magma (Fig. 6). The maximum temperature at the surface can reach the range of 220\u2013260 \u00b0C in our model. In fact, this temperature can be higher in the case of a higher geothermal gradient. In addition, we disregard the heat from rock radioactivity and regional tectonic activity to decrease the influence of unknown factors. Deep faults participate as pathways for the migration circulation of geothermal groundwater to control the depth of fluid infiltration and the temperatures of geothermal springs in the YGR (Sadeghi and Khalajmasoumi, 2014).\nThe maximum detachment depths of the boundary fault in the models are defined at 10\u00a0km and 15\u00a0km below the surface based on regional geology and seismic data in the models, respectively. Generally, it is difficult for meteoric water to penetrate the brittle-ductile transition zone located at depths in the range of 12\u201314\u00a0km (Violay et al., 2015; Wanner et al., 2020). However, meteoric water that penetrates faults down to depths of 10\u00a0km and even 13\u00a0km has been reported and is likely involved in the seismicity of deep host faults (Diamond et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2020). Fluid flow can be triggered by repeated seismic activity (Louis et al., 2019), which is also recorded in the travertine deposits with Cs anomalies over time in the YGR (Su et al., 2020). Seismicity would increase the permeability of faults and promote the deep circulation of geothermal groundwater in the YGR down to the middle crust. The two types of models with different depths for the boundary fault indicate different pathways of hydrothermal circulation, producing variable temporal and spatial distributions of thermal anomalies (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013f and Fig.\u00a07m\u2013r). The Laduogang spring is 42\u201345 \u00b0C and is located near the geological section simulated in the model (corresponding to the location of fault F5, Fig. 1). Eleven wells were drilled in 1988; however, no high-temperature water was obtained (Tong et al., 2000). This means that the boundary fault could not reach great depths. Alternatively, subfaults (such as F4-6) are not connected with deep faults, while the thermal flow is derived from the western fault (Fig.\u00a07a\u2013f). Many other reasons could explain the temperature of Laduogang spring due to complex geological evolution. In contrast, the hot springs at Qucai, Gulu and Yangbajing have higher temperatures, which would be more reasonable using the deep fault model. The high geothermal gradient in a shallow reservoir of the southern field of Yangbajing (Dor et al., 2008) is consistent with Model 2\u20131 (Fig.\u00a07a\u2013f). We prefer the profile across the Ningzhong rift, in which the boundary fault is detached at a depth of 10\u00a0km beneath the surface, because this depth matches the brittle-ductile transition zone and this zone could provide enough heat to the surface spring. Meanwhile, the deep thermal flow from partial-melt magma cannot be transmitted to the surface by heat convection without a deep fault. The boundary fault across Yangbajing could be deeper, and further simulational research is needed.\nThree types of fault permeability are assigned to simulate their influence on groundwater circulation in Model 1. Notably, the permeability values are not completely realistic due to the lack of deep data on rocks. This model shows that low-permeability (10\u221215 m2) faults cannot provide an effective pathway for hydrothermal circulation and yield very weak thermal anomalies. The thermal anomaly induced by the moderate-permeability (10\u221214 m2) fault is delayed by 60,000\u00a0yr compared with that induced by a high-permeability (10\u221213 m2) fault (several hundred years). The tritium contents (<1 TU) of geothermal springs from Ningzhong and Gulu indicate their source from modern water (Wang et al., 2017). The hot springs are replenished very quickly, implying that they either have higher-permeability fault pathways or low-permeability recharge in short-distance and high-temperature environments. However, we cannot disregard the fact that no young volcanic rocks have been reported in the shallow layer. The shallowest magma chamber is buried at least 10\u00a0km beneath the surface, as explored by a detailed magnetotelluric and microseismogram sounding survey (Wu, 1996), and cannot effectively influence the hot spring as suggested in Model 2\u20132 (Fig. 7). In contrast, earthquakes occur frequently at depths from 10 to 20\u00a0km in this region, implying the possibility that deep faults transmit water and heat to the surface. In addition, more attention is given to the process of large-scale hydrothermal circulation in large faults; thus, the changes in small fault networks are disregarded in this paper. In fact, the deep fault would also be sealed and have very low permeability due to the alteration of minerals, and the hydrothermal fluids could be delivered by a new fault network with high permeability formed in subsequent earthquakes. This process could produce episodic variations in the temperatures of springs with changing composition contents of travertine depositions (Fig. 2).\nAdditionally, the temperatures of hot springs are also controlled by topography. High-temperature springs usually occur in the low-elevation discharge region. In contrast, the high-elevation springs have lower temperatures due to the direct recharge of shallow groundwater. This result is consistent with previous research (Taillefer et al., 2018).\n\n\n5.2\nRAM source\nThere is no doubt that water-rock interactions contribute to one of the main mineral sources of thermal springs in the YGR (Wang et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2014). However, geothermal springs also illustrate certain characteristics of magmatic origin such as predominant anions \ufeffCl\u2212 anions and large volumes of volatiles related to magma (Bernard et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017b). Partial melting is an important fractionation process in the differentiation of the crust and generates aqueous fluids, hydrous melts, or transitional and supercritical fluids (Hermann and Rubatto, 2009). These fluids have enrichments of alkali metal elements that are very similar to those in geothermal water (Su et al., 2020). In fact, RAM elements such as Li, Rb, and Cs are easily mobilized (You et al., 1996). Hence, it is reasonable for RAMs to move upward with volatile fluid from partial melts during the process of hydrothermal circulation. This process is built into our model in which the enriched RAMs of the hot spring are recharged from magma generated by the partial melting of the middle crust. The fluid pathways in hydrothermal circulation models suggest that the RAMs leached from deep magma could migrate upward along faults with geothermal groundwater circulation (Fig. 9). It is difficult for fluids to migrate in crystalline rocks without faults (Fig. 9). The concentrations of RAMs are diluted by the downward infiltration of cold groundwater and increase with the upward flow of thermal groundwater along faults. This outcome causes a significant discrepancy in the concentrations of RAMs across the rift, which is generally consistent with the distribution of geothermal anomalies. In fact, RAM enrichments correlate with geothermal water temperatures (Wang et al., 2019). Li concentrations are more enriched in high-temperature springs and vary with time (Fig. 2), implying the migration of RAMs with hydrothermal circulation in the YGR. Hot springs have been considered to have different degrees of mixing between shallow groundwater and deep geothermal fluids (Guo et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2014). In our model, the varied mineral contents of hot springs could be achieved by recharge from the magma source associated with hydrothermal circulation. The RAM concentrations vary with time and space (Fig. 9), which explains the increases in RAMs in travertine deposited in the later stage (Fig. 2). The fault structure, such as the depths of subfaults, varies greatly along the strike of the rift. These variations change the pathways of hydrothermal circulation and further influence the migration of RAMs. We prefer the pathways of RAMs in Model 3\u20132 (Fig.\u00a09i\u2013p) because the temperature of Laduogang spring is low and this spring should have shallow subfaults. Certainly, this interpretation needs to be tested in the field and by 3-D simulation research in the future. Our model proposes possible migration pathways for enriched elements in hot springs and could be used to guide the exploration and utilization of geothermal resources in the future.\nA conceptual model that describes the enrichment of RAMs correlated with faults and deep magma during hydrothermal circulation is given in Fig. 10\n. The occurrence of the present molten magma is most likely caused by underthrusting and thickening of Tibetan crust, implying a granitic composition (Brown et al., 1996). The formation time of magmatism has been debated either as continuous (Weller et al., 2016) or episodic since the Miocene (Kapp et al., 2005). The young hydrothermal deposits indicate that the molten magma either appears very late or has a very late role in the hydrothermal system. However, regardless of when the magma is formed, it is impossible to form hydrothermal mineralization without deep fault connecting to the magmatic layer. Ice-melt water and precipitated water seep into the deep along the boundary fault and then bring the RAM-enriched fluid to the surface. The model emphasizes the existence of deep faults detaching to the middle crust. The fault and magmatic source comprise hydrothermal circulation, which leads to RAM-enriched geothermal metallogenesis.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nHydrothermal circulation simulations provide a new perspective on the anomalous distribution of geothermal groundwater and allow us to evaluate the migration and enrichment of RAMs in the hot springs of the YGR. These simulations suggest that the deep structure controls the thermal degree and distribution of hot springs in the YGR. The detached depth of the boundary fault reaches at least 10\u00a0km beneath the surface. The magma at this depth has a limited effect on the upper hydrothermal circulation without corresponding deep faults. With an increase in the burial depth, the magma will decrease its influence on the temperature of springs. Magma produced by the partial melting of the middle crust could be the heat source for thermal springs in the case of fault activity. Meteoric water infiltrates to the depth of deep magma depending on the permeability of faults, which could be increased by seismicity. Magma from the partial melting of the middle crust supplies a certain amount of RAMs to hot springs in the YGR through faults associated with the hydrothermal circulation process. This action causes the RAM concentrations to vary with time and space.\n\n","13":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFaults and fractures are products of brittle deformation, and their combined influence not only governs the direction of hydrothermal fluid flow within geological media but also determines the final geometry and extent of the resultant hydrothermal ore deposit (e.g., Hodgson, 1989; Sibson, 1992; Sibson, 1996; Roberts et al., 1999; Stowell et al., 1999; Cox et al., 2001; Gaboury et al., 2001; Lafrance, 2004; Austin and Blenkinsop, 2009; Yang et al., 2013; Micklethwaite et al., 2015; Taillefer et al., 2017). Thus, analysis of fault-fracture networks and their controls on mineralization is important for better defining targets for mineral exploration and constraining genetic models ore genesis (e.g., Caine et al., 1996; Brogi, 2008; Rowland and Simmons, 2012; Blenkinsop et al., 2020).\nAs illustrated by authors such as Sibson (1996), Lonergan et al. (1999) and Ramsay and Chester (2004), detailed documentation of vein types, textures and geometries within a mineralized vein system, as well as structures in the enclosing wall rocks (e.g., slickenlines, chatter marks and fibers), is a critical step in gaining a better understanding of the fault systems hosting and controlling mineralization. For example, Sibson (1996) used vein geometries to interpret stress states and fault systems related to mineralization. Along the same line, Lonergan et al. (1999) found that in the case of faults that acted as hydrothermal fluid conduits, vein patterns are strongly influenced by the orientation of the principal stress direction relative to the fault (or fracture) plane. These angular relationships produce mode I (opening) and hybrid mode (mode I and shear mixed mode) fractures (or veins) (e.g., Ramsay and Chester, 2004). From fracture mechanics, mode I fractures are formed at an angle of 0 to 3\u00b0, while hybrid mode fractures form at about 5 to 15\u00b0 to the maximum principal stress (Ramsay and Chester, 2004). Thus, kinematic analysis, combined with vein geometrical analysis, provides crucial evidence for determining the likely orientation of structures that are active during hydrothermal mineralization (e.g., Cox et al., 2001).\nFractal-geometry methods are ideally suited to quantifying complex structural arrays and interpreting processes that generate such arrays (e.g., Mandelbrot, 1977; Kruhl, 2013). In geology, structural data typically show a power-law distribution (Mandelbrot, 1983; Turcotte, 1986; Biegel et al., 1989; Sanderson et al., 1994; Clark et al., 1995; Johnston and McCaffrey, 1996; McCaffrey and Johnston, 1996; Loriga, 1999; Billi, 2005; Andr\u00e9-Mayer and Sausse, 2007; Perugini and Kueppers, 2012). As such, fractal-geometry methods are applicable to and have been widely used for examining (i) the frequency distribution of fractures, faults, joints, (ii) the thickness and spacing of veins (Aviles et al., 1987; Gillespie et al., 1993; Brooks and Manning, 1994; Manning, 1994; Cello et al., 2000; Ayunova et al., 2007; Zazoun, 2008; Deng et al., 2014), as well as (iii) factors controlling the location of ore deposits along damage zones (Roberts et al., 1998; Blenkinsop and Sanderson, 1999; Groves et al., 2000; Haddad-Martim et al., 2017).\nBox counting (e.g., Blenkinsop and Sanderson, 1999; Gumiel et al., 2010) and linear traverse (e.g., Sanderson et al., 2008; Fagereng, 2011) methods are two additional, popular approaches for estimating the fractal dimensions (D-values) of vein systems. For example, Gumiel et al. (2010) examined the geometry and fractal properties of a vein system using the D-values of a stockwork vein system obtained by way of box-counting, whilst Roberts et al. (1999) employed a linear traverse survey to study the percolation and fractal properties of a vein system. Key aims in both studies were to gain a better understanding of the vein forming mechanisms and use the learnings to improve mineral exploration targeting.\nIn this study, we performed geometrical and fractal analyses of a well-exposed vein system that crops out along the southeastern coastline of Gasado Island, southwestern Korean Peninsula. We analyzed both along and across vein-filled fault systems, to better understand the spatial heterogeneity of ore-bodies since mineralization in the study area is strongly controlled by oblique sinistral-normal faults. Our main objective was to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of mineralizing fluid flow based on a detailed study of the mineralized veins and their controlling fault-fracture network. An important result of this study is that the distribution characteristics and geometries of veins varied according to fault architecture, and in particular, the density of veins was concentrated in damaged zones. Therefore, an understanding of fault architecture related to hydrothermal mineralization is essential for exploration targeting in the area.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe Mugeug and Haenam-Jindo Au-Ag metallogenic provinces are related to Cretaceous pull-apart basins, calderas, and volcano-tectonic depressions in South Korea (Choi et al., 2005). Their deposits are spatially associated with the NNE-striking sinistral Gongju\u2013Eumseong and Yeongdong\u2013Gwangju fault systems (Fig. 1\n; Choi et al., 2005; Bowden, 2007). Au-Ag mineralization occurred during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous associated with volcanic activity localized in the transtensional pull-apart basins (Choi et al., 2005) within the fault systems, which are interpreted to have formed by the northward subduction of the Izanagi Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate (Lee and Paik, 1990; Chough et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2005). Gasado Island in the Haenam-Jindo metallogenic provinces is located in the southwestern region of the Youngdong\u2013Gwangju fault system (Fig. 1). A Late Cretaceous volcanic-hosted epithermal Au-Ag vein system is developed near a lighthouse located on the southern coastline of Gasado Island (Fig. 2\n).\nThe study area comprises of Late Cretaceous acidic to intermediate volcanic rocks. Gasa tuffaceous rocks (i.e., interbedded welded tuff, sedimentary rock, and welded lapilli tuff) are overlain by rhyolites and andesites (Fig. 2a; Kim and Yuhn, 1971; Yoon and Jung, 2008). The lowermost interbedded welded tuff is poorly exposed in the study area, while sedimentary rocks and welded lapilli tuff are more common (Yoon and Jung, 2008). Rhyolites overlie welded lapilli tuffs in the northern part of the island, whereas andesites intrude Gasa tuffaceous rocks in the central part. Tuffs and rhyolites in Gasado Island are interpreted to be equivalent to volcanic rocks in the nearby Jindo area, which have been dated at 73.9\u201376.3 and 72.5\u201375.4\u00a0Ma, respectively (K-Ar analysis of whole rock; Kim and Keisuke, 1992).\nNE-SW-trending, Au-Ag-bearing quartz vein systems are well exposed in the southeastern part of the study area (Fig. 2b, c). In previous studies, quartz vein systems are referred to as the Lighthouse [referred to as the Lighthouse Vein system (LV) in this study], Lighthouse East, Main, Spad, Beach (Nos. 1\u20133), and Stock vein systems based on their location (e.g., Bowden, 2007). The Lighthouse and Lighthouse East veins have gold grades of up to 2.3 and 0.9\u00a0g\/t, respectively, and silver concentrations of up to 109.9 and 196.1\u00a0g\/t, respectively (Lee et al., 2000). Sericite from hydrothermal alteration zones associated with these veins has been dated at 70.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 and 70.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0Ma (K-Ar analysis; Koh et al., 2000). Fluid inclusion and stable isotope (oxygen and hydrogen) studies by Kim et al. (2002) have demonstrated that Au-Ag mineralization is likely associated with the circulation of hot and low-salinity (158\u2013253\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.9\u20133.4 equiv. wt. % NaCl) meteoric waters (\u03b418Owater\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210.1 to \u22128.0 \u2030, \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221268 to \u221264 \u2030).\nData on the mineralized vein-filled fault systems were divided into pre- and post-mineralization vein (or fault) systems based on cross-cutting relationships. These cross-cutting relationships indicate that rocks in the study area experienced at least three generations of deformation, along with variations in their local stress fields (Fig. 2c). In short, N-S trending veins are displaced by the mineralized vein-filled fault systems. These mineralized systems are in turn displaced by NW-trending normal-dextral faults and andesitic dikes. The detailed documentation of this deformation history is beyond the scope of this study.\n\n\n3\nResearch methods\n\n3.1\nGeometrical analysis\nExposures along the southeastern coastline were mapped at the 1:5,000 scale to investigate the relationships between fractures, faults, and Au-Ag bearing veins. In particular, detailed surveys were conducted along the northeastern coastline near the lighthouse (Lighthouse Northeastern Vein system (LNV) in Fig. 2b), where a well-exposed vein-filled-fault system [hereafter referred to as VF(s)] can be observed in both vertical and horizontal planes. Two methods were applied for the geometrical analysis to understand the fault system related to the mineralization. First, we performed grid mapping (or produced detailed sketches) of the six individual fault systems showing precise geometrical relationships between veins and faults. Integration of the geometrical evidence along each VF (along-vein-filled-fault system; Fig. 3\na) can be used to interpret the kinematics of the VF. Second, we performed a traverse-line survey (set normal to the main trend of faults or veins) to understand the fault zone architectures of each VF. Data on vein thickness (measured normal to the main trend) and vein type were corrected, and fault zone architectures (simply defined as structures in the fault system such as damage zone, fault core, etc.) were classified along the traverse. These data were used to interpret the distribution characteristics of veins across the VF (cross-vein-filled-fault system; Fig. 3b).\nIn addition, based on kinematics analysis, all vein types were divided into mode-I and hybrid types to define fault zone architectures where the veins were filled. In this study, in cases in which veins were filled in fault planes (shear plane) or shear fractures, the vein type was considered as a hybrid type (opening\u00a0+\u00a0shearing), while in cases in which veins were filled in mode-I fractures in the damage zone, the vein type was considered as a mode-I type (opening).\nSixteen hand specimens were collected from outcrops encountered along the LNV traverse for geochemical analysis to determine their gold (lower detection limit: 2\u00a0ppb) and silver (lower limit: 0.05\u00a0ppm) contents. Powdered specimens were analyzed using a neutron activation analyzer (INAA) and the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) technique at Actlabs, Canada.\n\n\n3.2\nFractal analysis (box counting and line traverses)\nFractal analysis was performed using box counting and line traverse analyses. Through the box-counting analysis, we aimed to quantify and compare the vein geometries, which were developed at each architecture along the VF. Through the linear traverse analysis, we aimed to interpret the scale property of the vein thickness population across the vein-filled-fault system.\nThe BENOIT program (version 1.31, created by TruSoft International, Incorporated, 1999; e.g., Lehane and Ekdale, 2013) was used to calculate the D-value (fractal dimension) of each vein geometry in the box. The procedure was as follows: (1) drawing the vein systems in the CorelDraw program, (2) converting the sketch image to two-tone images (black backgrounds with white foregrounds), (3) saving the image as 500-dpi bitmap files (BMP), and (4) importing the final image into the BENOIT program. For a square grid of cell side length r, the number (N) of cells containing a vein is given by \nN \u2248 r-Dc\n\n, where Dc is the capacity dimension (e.g., Blenkinsop and Sanderson, 1999; Lehane and Ekdale, 2013).\nWith regard to the traverses, the geometry, orientation, and thickness (minimum thickness\u00a0\u2265\u00a01\u00a0mm) of veins were recorded to characterize the scale property of vein distribution across the VF. Generally, the cumulative frequency of vein thickness complies with a power-law distribution with the following equation:\n\n(1)\n\n\nN\u00a0=\u00a0Ct-D\n\n\n\n\nwhere N is the cumulative number of veins (thickness\u00a0\u2265\u00a0t), C is the cumulative number of veins (\u2265unit size), and exponent D is the slope of the log\u2013log plot or fractal dimension of distribution (e.g., Sanderson et al., 1994; Roberts et al., 1999).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nE-W trending cliffs of the LNV area display exposures of interbedded tuffaceous sandstones and mudstones that are cut by the VF. Some examples (Fig. 4, Fig. 5\n\n) located on the traverse line were selected as representative types showing kinematic evidence of the VF based on their diversity. Geochemical analyses for the LNV yielded maximum Au and Ag values of 8.69 and 99.39\u00a0ppm, respectively.\n\n4.1\nGeometric analysis\n\n4.1.1\nVertical plane\n\n4.1.1.1\nExample 1: Planar fault-hosted vein systems\nQuartz veins with a maximum thickness of 3\u00a0cm have filled in the NE-striking fault plane (Fig. 4a, b). The veins are weakly branched and splayed without a prominent damage zone. The VF displaces sedimentary layers by\u00a0<\u00a05.5\u00a0cm and displays a normal slip sense, with the western hanging wall block (hereafter, HW) displaced downwards relative to the footwall block (hereafter, FW).\n\n\n4.1.1.2\nExample 2: Linking damage zone-hosted vein systems\nQuartz veins, with a maximum thickness of 10\u00a0cm, have filled in both segmented NE-striking fault planes and mode-I fractures in the damage zones (linking and wall damage zones; Fig. 4c, d). The veins show various geometries along the VF. In Box-2 (hereafter B2), relatively thin veins are highly scattered over the linking damage zone, while in B3, veins are sparsely distributed in the wall damage zones of HW and FW, and in B4, a thick rhombic vein mass is developed at the linking damage zone. Host rock layers have been displaced about 20\u00a0cm with a west-side down movement sense with respect to the VF.\n\n\n4.1.1.3\nExample 3: Wall damage zone and segmented fault-hosted vein systems\nQuartz veins with a maximum thickness of 15\u00a0cm have filled in both segmented (or stepping) NE-striking fault planes and mode-I fractures in the damage zones (linking and wall damage zones) (Fig. 4e, f). Veins show various geometries along the VF: in B5, veins have filled in the segmented fault plane and mode-I fractures of the damage zone (linking and wall damage zones), while in B6, they have filled in the segmented fault planes, branched fractures, and mode-I fractures of the damage zone (linking and wall damage zones). In B7, relatively thin veins are distributed in the wall damage zones of FW, and in B8, various thicknesses of veins have filled in the right-stepping fault planes. The host rock layers have been displaced (\u223c5.5\u00a0cm) with respect to the VF, showing normal movement sense.\nVarious vein geometries and thicknesses have been identified within three minor fault systems within a main fault system. These different vein patterns strongly depend on the types of damage zone in the system. For example, Fig. 4c illustrates a case in which most veins are concentrated at the linking damage zone, while the veins shown in Fig. 4e are highly scattered over the wall damage zone and segmented fault planes. In addition, veins which have filled the damage zones (Fig. 4c, e) show more complex vein geometries than those which have filled the fault planes only (Fig. 4a).\nGenerally, subvertical mode I fractures and veins, caused by a subvertical maximum principal stress (Andersonian theory; e.g., Anderson, 1942), are frequently observed in normal fault systems. Thus, the presence of subvertical veins in the damage zones (Fig. 4c, e) indicate a normal sense movement along the VF, and this interpretation based on the vein geometry is also consistent with the slip sense of key beds.\n\n\n\n4.1.2\nHorizontal plane\n\n4.1.2.1\nExample 4: Bending fault-hosted vein systems\nQuartz veins with a maximum thickness of 10\u00a0cm have filled both the left- and right-bending NE-striking fault planes and mode-I fractures in the linking damage zone (Fig. 5a, b). Veins show various geometries and thicknesses along the VF. In B9, veins fill the left-bending fault plane and mode-I fractures of the linking damage zone, with maximum thicknesses of 10 and 2\u00a0cm, respectively. In B10, veins show a right-bending geometry with decreased thicknesses from 10 to 5\u00a0cm, while in B11, vein thicknesses increase from 5 to 10\u00a0cm with a slightly left-bending geometry of the fault plane.\n\n\n4.1.2.2\nExample 5: Parallel fractures and bending fault-hosted vein systems\nQuartz veins with a maximum thickness of 15\u00a0cm have filled the left- and right-bending NE-striking fault planes, as well as a NE-striking subparallel fracture set and some mode-I fractures in the immature (not fully connected) linking damage zone (Fig. 5c, d). Vein geometries in each box (B12\u2013B15) are similar: most of the thicker veins have filled the NE-trending bending and segmented fault planes, while relatively thinner veins have filled the NE-striking shear fractures and some mode-I fractures. Vein thicknesses slightly change depending on the bending direction; in the case of the right bend (B13), the vein thicknesses decrease, while in the case of the left bend (B14), the vein thicknesses increase.\n\n\n4.1.2.3\nExample 6: Linking damage zone-hosted vein systems\nQuartz veins with a maximum thickness of 10\u00a0cm have filled both NE-striking fault planes and mode-I fractures in the linking damage zone (Fig. 5e, f). Veins show various geometries along the VF: in B16, veins have filled the fault plane and subparallel shear fractures, while in B17, veins have filled the mode-I fractures in the linking damage zone, and in B18, veins have filled both the fault plane and mode-I fractures in the linking damage zone.\nIn general, structures in the fault linking damage zone typically differ depending on whether the zone is under an extensional or contractional regime; thus, structures in the zone can be a kinematic clue to interpret the slip motion along a fault (e.g., Kim et al., 2004). In the case of the general extensional regime, mode-I fractures subparallel to the maximum principal stress can develop in the damage zone, and these fractures are often filled with veins or other materials. Similarly, either releasing or restraining bends can develop depending on the relationship between the bending direction and the sense of slip motion.\nIn this study, three horizontal outcrops were analyzed to interpret the horizontal movement sense of the VF. Mode I veins within the linking damage zones and vein thickness changes along the bending fault plane indicate that the veins are closely related to the NE-striking sinistral strike-slip fault. Consequently, the VF in the LNV area was interpreted as an oblique slip (normal-sinistral) fault system based on the geometrical analysis of the veins performed on vertical and horizontal planes.\n\n\n\n4.1.3\nLNV traverse line\nIn the 80\u00a0m-long, NW-trending LNV traverse line, we collected the (1) number of veins, (2) vein thickness, (3) dip separation (measured along the dip of fault) of faults, and (4) number of fractures (Table 1\n, Fig. 6\na\u2013c). The cumulative frequency of each dataset was plotted against the distance along the transect line on a log-normal scale. The fault system comprised NE-trending, normal-sinistral faults (evidenced by the geometrical analysis of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5)) with Au-bearing quartz veins (0.1 to 100\u00a0cm widths), with a dip separation of 4 to 80\u00a0cm. Based on the changes in cumulative frequency, this system could be divided into six fault-related damage zones (indicated by red- and yellow-shaded fields in Fig. 6b and c). Detailed information about each fault is listed in Table 1. We divided the structures into syn- and post-mineralization based on the cross-cutting relationships and geometries.\nSix damage zones could be divided into two domains based on the directions of the fault dips as the NW- and SE-dipping domains (Fig. 6). The NE-trending and E-dipping Fault 1 contains\u00a0<\u00a03\u00a0cm-thick quartz veinlets. The dip-separation is \u223c80\u00a0cm, and the damage zone is poorly developed. In the case of Fault 2, fractures and veins are concentrated in the FW part. Faults 3, 5, and 6 are located within the damage zone of Fault 4, and local slips (9.5\u201316\u00a0cm) were identified along these vein-filled subvertical faults. These minor faults were interpreted to have formed by local slip along the mode I fractures of Fault 4. The characteristics of Fault 4 (Fig. 4e), Fault 7 (Fig. 4a), and Fault 8 (Fig. 4c) have been explained in the previous section (the examples in Fig. 5 are located on the horizontal plane around these faults). Faults 7 and 9 show that veins tend to be concentrated in the FW part, while fractures are concentrated in the HW part. This indicates that Faults 7 and 9 may have acted as barriers to upwelling fluids. The NE-trending and W-dipping Fault 10 hosts the thickest vein (<1 m) in the section (Fig. 6c). Although the amount of displacement could not be measured due to flooding by seawater, the frequency of vein occurrence steadily increases within the HW of Fault 10, and the approximate width of the damage zone could be estimated through this change (\u223c10\u00a0m or more; Fig. 6a).\nThus, Fault 10 was interpreted to be the main fault due to having the greatest vein thickness and widest damage zone in the VF. Faults 1\u20136 and Faults 7\u20139 were interpreted to be antithetic and synthetic faults, respectively, within the deformation zone of Fault 10. Based on the cross-sectional analysis, including the previous geometrical analysis, the VF was interpreted as a NE-trending full-graben system with sinistral shear sense.\n\n\n\n4.2\nFractal analysis\n\n4.2.1\nBox counting analysis\nEighteen box-counting analyses were performed in this study, and the results are shown in Fig. 5c. The density of veins (V\u03c1) within each box was quantified using the ArcGIS program (i.e., vein occupied pixels\/total pixels).\nVertical plane (examples 1 to 3).\nThe veins of B1 (Fig. 3b) have filled a simple linear fault plane [slip plane; hereafter referred to as FP(s)] without any structural complexity, and the measured D-value was 1.106, which is nearly similar to the line (D\u00a0=\u00a01). In the case of B2 and B4 (Fig. 3d), the veins have filled both fault planes and linking damage zone [hereafter referred to as LDZ(s)], while the veins in B3 have filled the FP and mode I fractures [hereafter referred to as MIF(s)]. The D-values of each box were 1.642 for B2, 1.32 for B3, and 1.497 for B4, with relatively high D-values for the veins simultaneously filling the FP and LDZ. In the case of B5 and B6 (Fig. 3e), veins have filled the FPs, LDZs, and MIFs. Veins in B7 have filled only MIFs, and in B8, veins have filled two segmented FPs. The D-values of each box were 1.343 for B5, 1.492 for B6, 1.288 for B7, and 1.322 for B8, with relatively high D-values for veins simultaneously filling the FPs, LDZs, and MIFs.\nHorizontal plane (examples 4 to 6).\nThe veins of B9 have filled both the FP and MIFs of the LDZ, while for B10 and B11, they have filled only the FP (Fig. 5b). The D-values were 1.382 for B9, 1.127 for B10, and 1.199 for B11, and the veins of B9 simultaneously filling the FP and LDZ had the highest D-value. The boxes in Fig. 5d were set on veins showing similar geometries, and the resulting D-values were similar as well: 1.431 for B12, 1.428 for B13, 1.473 for B14, and 1.412 for B15. The veins of B16 have filled both the FP and subparallel fractures, while for B17 have filled only the MIFs in the LDZ, and for B18, they have filled both the FP and MIFs of the LDZ (Fig. 5f). The D-values were 1.238 for B16, 1.465 for B17, and 1.696 for B18, the highest D-value was found for veins simultaneously filling both the FP and MIF.\nThe results of the box-counting analysis for the six examples were as follows, and details are shown in Fig. 7\na: 1) In most cases, the D-value was relatively higher in the case of veins filling both the LDZ and FP; 2) similar geometries of veins showed similar D-values (Fig. 5d); 3) the graph in Fig. 7b (the horizontal axis is the number of boxes and the vertical axis is the D-value) shows the D-values of each box. All vein data were classified into mode I, hybrid, and mixed veins (mixed mode I and hybrid mode; i.e., veins which have filled both the FP and MIFs) to divide the D-values by vein type. As a result, relatively higher D-values were observed in the mixed veins in most cases; and 4) Fig. 7c (vertical: D-value, horizontal: V\u03c1 of each box) shows the relationship between the D-value and V\u03c1. In most cases, the D-value and V\u03c1 showed a direct proportional relationship. However, B4 vs. B2 and B13 vs. B12 showed boxes with a small V\u03c1 and a high D-value. This was interpreted as being due to whether veins were localized at specific parts or distributed over a wider area of the box.\nA D-value close to 1 to 2 indicates a closer shape to that of the plane from the line, eventually filling up a relatively large amount of space. In this study, the degree of space filling was interpreted to be affected by the development of the damage zone and the degree of vein distribution (i.e., damage zone type) within the estimated box. The vein geometries are strongly controlled by fault structures, meaning that the fault damage zone could control the physical properties of hydrothermal fluid flow. Thus, variable D-values for different areas of a fault system may help to quantify the areas based on their structural complexity, density, and permeability. These features are useful for identifying areas of potential fluid concentration and mineralization in fault systems.\n\n\n4.2.2\nLinear traverse analysis\n\n4.2.2.1\nLighthouse Northeastern Vein system (LNV)\nNinety-two veins with thicknesses from 1 to 1000\u00a0mm were identified in the LNV traverse line (Fig. 6, Fig.8\n). The vein density was 1.15\u00a0m\u22121 and thickness per meter was 10.825\u00a0mm\/m (Table 2\n). The cumulative number of veins per meter with a thickness\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0mm was plotted versus thickness (t) on the log\u2013log graph to estimate the D-value (Fig. 8a). As a result, the slope change indicating more than two D-values was confirmed to be in the ranges of 10\u00a0mm\u00a0<\u00a0t\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0mm (yellow arrows) and 20\u00a0mm\u00a0<\u00a0t\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0mm (blue arrows). The slope was divided into Domains I\u2013III based on the slope change, and further analysis was undertaken to understand the slope change as follows.\nFirst, we plotted all veins and their thickness (y-axis) measured at each point on the LNV traverse line (x-axis), and the veins were divided into hybrid and mode-I veins based on cross-sectional analysis (see 4.1.3; Fig. 8b). As a result, in most cases, mode-I veins were found to be concentrated around hybrid veins (F1\u201310). Based on the results of Fig. 6, this distribution characteristic was interpreted as being controlled by secondary fault damage zones accompanying the F10 fault. Note that mode I veins were similar or thicker than hybrid veins (see the mode-I vein in F10 damage zone).\nSecond, we plotted the number of veins (y-axis) corresponding to each thickness (t; x-axis) on the log\u2013log graph to investigate variation trends of the number of each vein thickness, while the same domains as Fig. 8a were set on the graph for comparison, and the data of Fig. 8c were divided into mode-I and hybrid veins (Fig. 8c). As a result, Domain I (blue dotted box) consisted of t\u00a0\u2264\u00a01.6\u00a0cm mode-I veins and five hybrid veins (F2, F5, F7, F8, F8\u2032), Domain II consisted of 1.7\u00a0\u2264\u00a0t\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.9\u00a0cm mode-I veins and one hybrid vein (F8), and Domain III consisted of only seven hybrid veins (F1, F3, F4, F6, F9, F9\u2032, F10) of 2.9\u00a0cm\u00a0\u2264\u00a0t. A mixed zone (i.e., the zone of mixed mode-I and hybrid vein thickness data; red transparent box) extending from Domain I to II was verified (Fig. 8c). The number of mode-I veins of t\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0cm in Domain I tended to decrease with increasing vein thickness, but this trend changed in a zigzag manner, meaning that it repeats the decrease and increase as it encounters the mixing zone. The change of vein type from the mode-I vein to the hybrid vein was recognized around the boundary of each domain box.\nThe D-values were 0.497 for Domain I, 1.25 for Domain II, and 0.62 for Domain III, indicating a slope change from Domains I to II because of the mixing of thickness data of the hybrid and mode I veins. However, the controlling factor of the slope change from Domains II to III is more ambiguous because the low correlation coefficient of Domain III could be interpreted as an erroneous D-value by a censoring effect. However, it should be noted that Domain III was comprised of only hybrid veins, unlike other domains. Thus, the difference in vein (or fracture) type could also be regarded as a potential controlling factor causing a slope change.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nLighthouse Vein system (LV)\nThe well-exposed, NE-trending, W-dipping LV (Fig. 2b, Fig. 9\n) cuts dacitic lapilli tuff and can be divided into the HW (western part; Fig. 9c, d) and FW (eastern part; Fig. 9e, f) areas. A NW-trending fault with normal slip sense, as evidenced by the LDZ, cuts the Lighthouse vein (Fig. 9b). The vein density of the HW is 1.68\u00a0m\u22121 and that of the FW 1.1\u00a0m\u22121, the thickness per meter of the HW is 11.92\u00a0mm\/m and that of the FW is 6.7\u00a0mm\/m (Table 2).\nTo validate and compare the scale property of the LNV traverse, the vein thickness data of LV from a previous study (Kim, 2016) were used and analyzed in the same way as the LNV traverse. However, note that geometrical and cross-sectional analyses were not performed for the LV area.\nWe plotted the cumulative number of veins per meter with thicknesses\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0mm versus thickness (t) on the log\u2013log graph to estimate D-values. The thickness of the main Lighthouse vein (13\u00a0m) was excluded to avoid duplicate calculations in the HW and FW. Changes in slopes were identified, which were similar to the LNV graphs: three different slopes (Domain I\u2013III) were recognized in the data for the HW, while two distinct slopes (Domains I and II) were recognized for the FW (Fig. 10\na). The change in slopes is indicated by pairs of colored arrows for comparison with graphs in Fig. 10d and e. Thus, an analysis similar to Fig. 8 was performed to investigate the controlling factors for the change in slopes.\nFirst, we plotted all veins and their thickness (x-axis) measured at each point on the 50\u00a0m-long LV traverse line (y-axis) of the HW and FW, respectively. As a result, the characteristics of both data distributions were similar to those of the LNV traverse (Fig. 8b). Thus, we divided the fault damage zones based on the vein distribution characteristics that relatively thin veins being concentrated around thicker veins (Fig. 10b, c); the HW had two damage zones and the FW had one.\nSecond, we plotted the number of veins (y-axis) corresponding to each thickness (t; x-axis) on the log\u2013log graph. As a result, the zigzag trend in the data distribution was similar to the trend (Fig. 8b) identified for the mixed zone of the LNV traverse (Fig. 10d). Although there is a small variation, the number of veins decreases until the vein thickness approached 5\u00a0mm (Fig. 10b), and such trends become irregular as they encounter the zigzag trending zone (8\u00a0mm\u00a0<\u00a0t\u00a0<\u00a090\u00a0mm). In the case of the FW data, the change in the number of veins with respect to the thickness change showed a systematic increase or decrease (Fig. 10e) without a zigzag pattern in a small range.\nThe LV veins could not be divided into further types due to a lack of cross-sectional analysis data; thus, it was difficult to perform further analysis. However, the LV graph shows a scale transition in the zigzag zone similar to that of the LNV graph, implying similar scale properties of vein distribution in both areas. In conclusion, it was interpreted that a change in slope occurred because of a factor that disturbed the steady decrease in the number of veins as they became thicker (i.e., factors generating the mixed zone or zigzag trending zone).\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nCharacteristics of vein distributions along individual fault populations\nGenerally, in the case of hydrothermal Au-Ag deposits formed by the concentrated flow of large volumes of fluid, understanding the relationships in the conduits that control fluid transport has important implications for mineralization and thus mineral exploration (Caine et al., 1996; Cox, 1999; Cox et al., 2001; Stephens et al., 2004; Tripp and Vearncombe, 2004). Common examples of conduits for hydrothermal fluids include faults, fractures, folds, schistosity, and bedding planes (Cox et al., 2001; Blenkinsop et al., 2020). Fluids can be evenly distributed across an entire structural pathway, or localized within specific structures within damage zones due to differences in strain (e.g., Cox et al., 2001). Strain conditions are determined by the crustal deformation event, and many mineral deposits show mineralization characteristics controlled by multiple events. Therefore, the geometrical analysis of a mineralized structure is important to fully understand the genetic history of a deposit (Blenkinsop, 2004; McKeagney et al., 2004; Stone and Archibald, 2004; Hronsky, 2020).\nFault-fracture meshes and veins are closely related because, given the right circumstances, the former provide open space for vein growth and metal accumulation (Sibson, 1996; Cox, 1999; Sanderson and Zhang, 2004). Fractures can be divided into extension (opening mode; mode I), shear (shearing mode; mode II and III), and hybrid (a mix of opening and shearing modes) types, depending on the stress regime and the fracture attitude (e.g., Ramsay and Chester, 2004). Based on the rules of fracture mechanics, veins and dykes are typically considered as having formed in extension fractures. However, veins can also develop within hybrid fractures (e.g., Belayneh and Cosgrove, 2010). Therefore, we divided the veins in this study into two types, mode I and hybrid veins, which differ from each other in terms of vein geometry, interpreted kinematics, and apparent displacement.\nDetailed analysis (Fig. 11\n) was conducted on the mineralized fault systems in Fig. 4. In the case of the single fault plane (Fig. 11a, d), veins only developed along the fault plane (main slip plane), while in the case of the linked fault system with damage zones (Fig. 11b, e), veins developed in both the fault plane and the damage zones. Both types show that vein distributions are concentrated in a relatively narrow zone around the fault. However, in the case of the segmented fault system with a wall damage zone (Fig. 11c, f), veins developed in both the fault planes and the damage zones, and veins are distributed in a relatively wider area around the fault. Hence, we argue that the width of the vein distribution zone depends on the type of damage zone (e.g., wall or linkage), which indicates that fluid flow can be spatially heterogeneous depending on the fault architecture.\nSeveral horizontal lines were drawn at regular intervals on each vein-filled-fault system to analyze the characteristics of change in vein thickness along the fault (Fig. 11d\u2013f). The thickness data of each vein are displayed as the height of the bar (red bar indicates hybrid vein and blue bar indicates mode-I vein) at all points at which the line and vein encounter. The cumulative thickness of all veins on the same line (by stacking all bars of each line) is represented on the left side of the box. The line connecting the cumulative thickness (blue dotted line) of all veins and hybrid veins appeared as a wavy shape. As a result, the total thickness of the vein was found to be thicker across the damaged area (maximum ratio\u00a0=\u00a03.15 in Fig. 11b, highest total thickness\/lowest total thickness).\nThe results of this analysis indicate that the geometries, vein distributions, and volume of veins along the individual fault system vary because the characteristics of fluid flow are strongly influenced by the architecture along the fault zone. Therefore, the interpretation and analysis of fault architecture is important in mineral exploration of ore deposits associated with mineralized fault systems.\n\n\n5.2\nScale transition across vein-filled-fault systems\nFractal analysis is characterized by a scaling law that associates a scale factor with two variables of the measurement object. This scaling relationship is then explained by the power law function, which in turn explains the inherent physical attributes of the analyzed object (Takayasu, 1990; Ortega et al., 2006; Afzal et al., 2011). Therefore, a more detailed analysis of the controlling factor of the slope change (or scale transition) in both LNV and LV is important in determining the physical attribute of the mineralized fault system in the study area.\nTo analyze and verify the mixing zone (i.e., the zigzag-trending data distribution), further studies were performed. First, we plotted each data of mode I and hybrid veins separated from LNV veins on separate graphs (x-axis: location along the 80\u00a0m traverse line, y-axis: vein thickness; Fig. 12\na, b). Second, the cumulative number of mode I veins per meter (>1 mm thick) were separated from Fig. 8a showing all vein data (Fig. 12c). Third, we divided the LNV veins shown in the Fig. 12c into mode-I and hybrid vein sections based on the range of their thickness.\nAs a result, the data overlapping range of the two types of veins was confirmed, and no noticeable slope change in the mode-I veins of the LNV could be distinguished (Fig. 12c). These results indicate that the thickness distribution is disturbed by hybrid veins filling the secondary fault planes. Thus, we find that the mixing of mode-I and hybrid veins is an important controlling factor for scale transition, and in this case, these characteristics of vein distribution across the fault system are strongly controlled by secondary fault damage zones.\nMore studies on mineralized fault systems are needed to understand the relationship between scale transition and ore grade. However, the results of the fractal and geometrical analysis of this study emphasize the importance of the role of damage zones in mineralized fault systems, which can help to adjust the exploration strategy and obtain information about related structures, i.e., it was confirmed that the physical properties of the mineralized fault system were controlled by the damage zones. In other words, the fluid flow along a fault system is controlled by the physical conduits or reservoirs (the damage zones), which strongly controls locally variable mineralization characteristics such as vein distribution and mineral precipitation. Therefore, to understand mineralized fault systems and increase the probability of blind ore exploration, it is important to find proper controlling factors for vein distribution, such as the damage zones in this study.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this study, we performed detailed analysis of a well-exposed vein system located along the southeastern coastline of Gasado Island. Our objective is to investigate the role of fault architecture on vein distribution. For this purpose, we analyzed the geometry of faults and veins to understand the fault systems that control Au-Ag mineralization. Secondly, we use box counting and line traverse analyses to investigate the relationship between the fault architectures and the D-value.\nThe main conclusions of our study are as follows:\n\n1.\nGeometrical analysis shows that vein systems are closely related to NE-striking, oblique (normal-sinistral) fault systems. Grid mapping of the six individual fault systems demonstrates that precise geometrical relationships exist between veins and faults. Fault slip directions interpreted from vein geometries are consistent with observed slip displacements of marker beds.\n\n\n2.\nBox counting analysis shows that the fractal dimension values are influenced by the types of structures present. The values were close to 2 when both hybrid fractures (fault planes) and the mode-I fractures (extension fractures in the damage zone) were filled with veins; the value close to 2 indicates a closer shape to that of the plane from the line, eventually filling up a relatively large amount of space. In this study, the degree of space filling was interpreted to be affected by the development of the damage zone and the degree of vein distribution (i.e., damage zone type).\n\n\n3.\nThe cumulative number of veins per meter with a thickness\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0mm was plotted versus thickness (t) on a log\u2013log graph to estimate fractal dimension values of two vein-filled fault systems (Lighthouse Northeastern Vein system and Lighthouse Vein System). Slope change (scale transition) data indicate more than two values exist for each vein systems. Plots of monofractal data describe a straight line, while multifractal data require two or more straight lines to be fitted. A detailed analysis of scale transition indicates that the thickness distribution is disturbed by hybrid veins filling the secondary faults.\n\n\n4.\nIn general, geometrical and box-counting analysis demonstrates that fault-hosted veins have an asymmetrical distribution. Understanding the fault architecture of a mineral deposit has implications for exploring for similar hydrothermal mineral deposits in the region. Furthermore, the fractal characteristics of a known fault-hosted mineralized vein system can be used as an indicator of the larger fault damage zone, providing an insight into the characteristics of fluid flow, particularly when exploration drilling is hindered by poor outcrop.\n\n\n\n\n","14":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nNi-laterite deposits in New Caledonia represent 7\u00a0% of the global mine production in 2021 (USGS, 2022). Laterite is a surficial formation developed after the deep weathering of rocks under a hot, wet tropical climate. The rainwater leaches most of the soluble elements, which leads to the residual concentration of more insoluble elements such as Al, Fe or Ni (Best, 2015). In the New Caledonian mining district, laterites originated from the weathering of ultramafic rocks consisting of relics of the obducted Peridotite Nappe during the Eocene (Chevillotte, 2005; Gautier et al., 2016; Sevin et al., 2014; Trescases, 1975). The downward migration of meteoric waters leached most elements from the peridotites (Mg, Ni, Si) except iron. Waters are saturated at depth with respect to newly-formed Si-Mg-Ni minerals in the saprolite (Butt and Cluzel, 2013; Freyssinet et al., 2005; Golightly, 2010; Haldar, 2017). During this process, Ni is trapped in Fe-(oxy)-hydroxides in the oxide zone and phyllosilicates in the saprolite ore (Dublet et al., 2012; Fritsch et al., 2016; Santoro et al., 2022; Villanova-de-Benavent et al., 2014). Ni is redistributed towards the bottom of the laterite profile during laterite formation due to the goethite dissolution-recrystallisation process, so-called the goethite ageing (Dublet et al., 2015). The tectonic uplift enhanced the downward redistribution process from the oxide zone toward the saprolite ore. Indeed, rejuvenating the topography and lowering the water tables maintained the drainage conditions required to redistribute elements and differentiate the laterite profile (Maurizot et al., 2020). Therefore, the competition between tectonic uplift and weathering rate controls the dominant ore type in Ni lateritic deposits. Oxide ore formation is favored in poorly uplifted areas dominated by weathering, whereas saprolite ore formation occurs in more uplifted areas (Butt and Cluzel, 2013; Maurizot et al., 2020). However, a pure \u201cper descensum\u201d model fails to fully explain the Ni heterogeneities observed in the saprolite (Quesnel et al., 2017), where several fissure infillings with distinct habitus and mineral-chemistry are found (Cathelineau et al., 2016, 2017). The Ni concentration in the saprolite ore is generally around 2\u00a0wt% and locally up to 5\u00a0wt% (Butt and Cluzel, 2013; Tauler et al., 2017). It results from the contribution of several Mg-Ni phyllosilicates (predominantly talc-like) forming the so-called \u201cgarnierite ore\u201d, whose Ni contents vary from a few % up to 30\u00a0wt% Ni (Cathelineau et al., 2017). This complexity results from a multiphase redistribution model based on the pre-concentration of Ni in fractures. The garnierite ore is subsequently affected by the downward migration of a dissolution front guided by fracture networks at the outcrop scale (Cathelineau et al., 2017). Fu et al. (2018) suggested that the origin of the \u201cgarnierite ore\u201d is closely linked to the preferential flow regime in conduits and is often associated with dissolution pipes. Iseppi et al. (2018) pointed out the structural control at the deposit- to massif- scale on the Ni remobilization. Inherited fractures control erosion at a massif scale and act as drains and permeability walls due to the impermeable serpentine coating at the deposit scale. Myagkiy et al. (2019) highlighted the effect of topographic slope and occurrence of fractures on Ni redistribution through the 2D modelling of reactive transport.\nMore generally, whatever the lithology, fractures may be organized as networks following fractal organization, meaning that fracture networks show the same spatial distribution at different scales (Basirat et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2007). Consequently, the structural organization observed at outcrop and larger scales should also be found at a smaller scale. In New Caledonia, fracture networks play an essential role in the Ni redistribution at the saprolitic level at the outcrop scale. There, the potential fractal organization of the fracture network would imply that Ni redistribution processes may present similarities at different scales. Furthermore, scaling laws have been widely applied to describe fracture network statistical properties at different scales (Afshari Moein et al., 2019; Bonnet et al., 2001; Bour, 2002; Masihi and King, 2008). The impact of scaling laws on fluid flow or seismic hazard has been widely explored (All\u00e8gre et al., 1982; de Dreuzy et al., 2012; Hatton et al., 1993), but the applicability to ore deposits formation remains to be addressed. The upscaling of Ni mineralization processes from the core to the field scale would be of prime interest for mine exploration. Although structural data are generally available at the regional and deposit scale (Jeanpert et al., 2019; Quesnel et al., 2017), microstructural, petrophysical or geochemical characterization at the sample scale is often lacking.\nThis paper investigates the impact of fracture networks at the sample scale on Ni redistribution when parent rocks are affected by the progression of the silicate dissolution front. Representative core samples of the dissolution front were collected from the Cagou pit (Koniambo Massif). Structural, petrophysical and geochemical features identified at the sample scale are compared to those documented at the scale of outcrops and mine workings, allowing discussion on the potential upscaling of the genetic processes for a correct understanding of the factors controlling the ore geometry.\n\n1.1\nGeological settings\nThe \u201cGrande Terre\u201d island of the New Caledonian archipelago, located in SW Pacific (Fig. 1\n.a), consists of ca. 30\u00a0% of ultramafic rocks, which are relics of the obducted Peridotite Nappe on the continental Norfolk Ridge during the Eocene period (Cluzel et al. 2001). The Peridotite Nappe is nowadays observed in the \u201cMassif du Sud\u201d and in klippes mainly along the West Coast, including the Koniambo Massif. Main fracture directions in the ultramafic rocks strike N130\u00b0-N150\u00b0, parallel to the main elongation direction of the island, which is commonly thought to be the obduction azimuth. However, several other sets of fractures striking N0\u00b0, N45\u00b0, and N90\u00b0 at the island scale are related to later deformation stages, including the Miocene extensional tectonics (Lagabrielle et al., 2005).\nAfter the obduction (late Oligocene), the peridotite is affected by deep weathering in a hot and humid climate, ending with a thick lateritic profile (Sevin et al., 2012). In the laterite profile, several domains can be outlined, which from base to top are (i) a saprolite horizon resulting from the progressive dissolution of the variably serpentinized peridotite bedrock mainly consisting of silicates (olivine), allowing the precipitation of phyllosilicates and goethite (detailed explanation of the chemical reactions are given in Butt and Cluzel (2013) and Myagkiy et al. (2017)), and of (ii) an oxide ore which is the final weathering stage, resulting from the dissolution and leaching of all minerals apart from immobile goethite (Fig. 1.c).\nThe Koniambo Massif (Fig. 1.b) is defined by a highly marked relief and poly-directional fracture network mainly oriented WNW-ESE, NS, NW-SE and NE-SW (Jeanpert et al., 2019; Quesnel et al., 2016). The regolith observed in the massif consists of hectometer-sized patches of laterite profiles of varying thicknesses ranging from a few meters to\u00a0>\u00a060\u00a0m (Quesnel et al., 2017). Ni-rich saprolites are mainly located on slopes where the oxide ore cover is thin or absent. In contrast, Ni-poor saprolites tend to be situated in topographic highs under thick oxide ore cover (Quesnel et al., 2017). The Cagou open pit, previously called Pit 207 in previous related studies describing the rock mineralogy (Cathelineau et al., 2017, 2016; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019), presents locally preserved oxide ore cover ranging from a few meters to 20\u00a0m in thickness, and an intense fracture network in the rocky saprolite - bedrock contact zone (Quesnel et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nTo study the impact of fractures on the weathering front progress at different scales, structural, petrophysical and geochemical data were collected on a 30\u00a0cm-long core sample (Fig. 2\n.a). The 30\u00a0cm-long core sample was collected at a depth between 6\u00a0m and 6.3\u00a0m of a vertical 41\u00a0m deep drill hole in the Cagou Pit (latitude: 20\u00b058\u203225.163\u2032\u2019 S, longitude: 164\u00b047\u203229.683\u2032\u2019 E, altitude: 755\u00a0m) (Fig. 1.b). The core sample shows a visible fracture network and an increase in weathering intensity, from the fresh peridotite at the bottom to the altered peridotite at the top, with a typical brownish colouring due to goethite. A 32\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a073\u00a0mm focus on the upper part of the core sample (named S_0) was used to describe the analyzed processes at the cm-scale. Various 20\u00a0mm \u00d7 20 mm subsamples from the core, respectively called S_1 to S_7 (Fig. 2.a), were also studied to provide data at the mm scale. Since the drill core is not oriented, all measured orientations are not in situ but relative ones. Yet, the subsamples are still oriented consistently with the core sample.\n\n2.1\nStructural data acquisition\nFractures features and beddings extraction.\nStructural analysis was based on 3D computed tomography (CT) imaging of the core sample and the sub-sample S_2 using the Nanotom Phoenix X-ray tomograph (GE) of GeoRessources laboratory. This non-destructive technique provides 3D visualizations of the internal structure of the samples based on the differential absorption of X-rays of the microfracture infillings. CT-scans revealed the structure density linked to differential absorption and were then compared to backscattered-electron (BSE) images obtained on S_2.\nThe CT scans were treated as image stack to extract fracture geometry using the FIJI software (Schindelin et al., 2012). One of the analytical challenges was the low-density contrast between fractures and the matrix in some areas. Indeed, the mineralogical phases in fractures and matrix mainly consist of light elements such as Si and Mg, with a minor Ni amount in fractures. Depending on the degree of mineral filling, the fractures appeared slightly darker than the matrix for poorly filled fractures or slightly brighter for mineralized fractures. The challenge was thus to find a method able to extract both poorly filled fractures and mineralized fractures from the matrix. Furthermore, the density of the matrix also changes as a function of the weathering degree, making the extraction of the fracture network even more challenging and hence the segmentation more complex. The point cloud of the stack was then extracted and imported into CloudCompare software (GPL software, 2021) to extract the fracture sets based on their dip\/direction value. Finally, planes were adjusted from points using the Ransac Shape Detection Plugin (Schnabel et al., 2007) and exported to analyze their spatial and orientation distribution.\nThe orientation analysis is performed on the Stereonet software (Allmendinger et al., 2011; Cardozo and Allmendinger, 2013). The spacing was analyzed by measuring the mean distance between plane traces belonging to the same set on an orthogonal plan.\nChromite distribution provides a guide for identifying the traces of the magmatic beddings (Leblanc, 1980). Indeed, since chromite minerals are much denser than the matrix mainly consisting of Mg-rich silicates, they are easily visible by tomography. Thus, point clouds of chromite minerals are extracted from CT scans by using FIJI. Then the normal for each point is calculated before adjusting a plane for each chromite alignment. Orientation of the magmatic foliation is then derived from the plane orientation.\n\n\n2.2\nFractal dimension analysis\nFractal dimension is an excellent tool to assess whether structures are statistically similar at different scales and characterize natural fracture networks (Basirat et al., 2019). Indeed, similar discontinuities have the same fractal dimension, whatever the scale. The fractal dimension of the fracture network is calculated on both the core sample and S_2 to evaluate the self-similar character of fracture patterns at the cm-scale and mm-scale. Since Ni is denser than Mg and Si, Ni is an excellent signal to discriminate mineralized fractures from the matrix. Thus, the micro-XRF Ni distribution map of the core sample was used to calculate the fractal dimension of the fracture network at the cm scale. Regarding the mm-scale, the S_2 CT scan was selected because of the excellent density contrast observed between the fracture network and the matrix, which eases the extraction of the fracture network. Additional information on CT acquisition, structural features (fractures and chromite beddings) extraction and the fractal dimension analysis are given in Appendix A.\n\n\n2.3\nPetrophysical characterization.\n\n2.3.1\nPoro-permeability profile acquisition\nUnder weathering conditions, the hydrolysis of peridotites leads to the leaching of Mg and Si, causing an increase in the porosity (Butt and Cluzel, 2013). Furthermore, previous hydrological studies at the massif scale report changes in porosity and permeability with weathering stages in laterite profiles (Jeanpert, 2017; Join et al., 2005). Thus, a porosity\u2013permeability profile is acquired along the core sample to describe better and characterize the weathering front in the sample. From the primary core sample, gas permeability was estimated on the five sub-samples, S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6 and S_7, the others being impregnated with resin for the micro-XRF mapping. For each sample, 2 to 3 different permeability measures were carried out with a confining pressure of 120\u00a0bar and injection pressure varying from 50\u00a0bar to 80\u00a0bar in the triaxial cell. Injection pressure and injection volumes were measured over time to estimate the mass flux and thus the permeability k with Darcy\u2019s law.\nThe final permeability value corresponds to the mean value of the different measures for each sub-sample. Total water porosity was also estimated on the same sub-samples by measuring the weight and volume differences of dry and wet samples.\nBased on the values obtained for these sub-samples and the mean X-ray attenuation profile from the tomographic acquisition of the main core sample, semi-quantitative water porosity and permeability profiles were obtained on the whole sample by interpolating the different values along the vertical. This interpolation was based on the linear regression between the porosity and the mean attenuation displayed by the grey-scale pixel intensity values of the subsamples. A similar approach was then applied to the permeability. The linear regression equation should be taken carefully since only 5 points were used to estimate it, thus providing a qualitative estimation of porosity and permeability profiles.\n\n\n2.3.2\nPore size distribution\nMercury injection porosimetry was performed in the pressure range from 8.4\u00a0kPa to 413\u00a0MPa, corresponding to pore sizes from 88\u00a0\u03bcm to 1.8\u00a0nm. This technique analyses the macro and mesopores and the pore size distribution. Sub-samples S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6 and S_7 were analyzed.\n\n\n\n2.4\nElement distribution\n\n2.4.1\n\u03bc-XRF element mapping\nChemical maps were acquired with an M4-Tornado Bruker micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (\u03bc-XRF). A voltage of 50\u00a0kV and a current of 400 \u03bcA with an acquisition time of 15\u00a0ms\/pixel and spacing of 100\u00a0\u03bcm for the core sample and a spacing of 20\u00a0\u03bcm for the S_0 sub-zone and the S_1 and S_2 sub-samples were chosen to capture the signal of both heavy elements (Co, Ni, Fe, Cr) and light ones (Mg, Si). Semi-quantitative analysis was carried out to assess the concentration of the different elements for each map using the built-in, standardless quantification functionality of the software, which is based on Fundamental Parameter analysis. In addition, a semi-quantitative 300-point line was acquired to study the evolution of Ni, Mg, Fe and Si concentrations along the core sample. The chemical profile is compared with a geochemical log carried out along a drill core located 44\u00a0m away from the studied core sample in the Cagou Pit (latitude: 20\u00b058\u203223.795\u2032\u2019 S, longitude: 164\u00b047\u203229.732\u2032\u2019 E, altitude: 730\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nStructural organization\n\n3.1.1\nFracture network description\nPoorly mineralized serpentine-bearing fractures occur as low-density objects, appearing thus as dark grey structural elements on tomographic images. They are denser than the olivine- and orthopyroxene-rich matrix when containing high Ni amounts (Fig. 3\n). The S_2 CT image displays the clear transition between the two fracture types: the lower part of the primary fracture crossing the sample is light grey, thus denser than its upper part, which appears in dark grey (Fig. 3.c). This transition is also well visible in the BSE imaging of sample S_2 (Fig. 3.d). In both cases, the contrast between the matrix and the fractures enables the discrimination of two distinct fracture sets (F1 set in red and F2 in yellow), whatever the scale (Fig. 3). Chromites appear as intense white specks corresponding as they have the highest density (Fig. 3).\nData extraction as fractures from the CT has been applied on both core and S_2 samples (Fig. 4\n). The samples are presented with the same orientation and display similar structural organization as shown by the dip direction stereonet (Fig. 4.d, Fig. 4.h). The main microfracture set, F1 (dark blue in Fig. 4.c, Fig. 4.g), is present in both samples. The second microfracture set, F2, is less well visible in yellow. The mean poles (trend, plunge) are N80E,42 for F1 and N259E,34 for F2 in the core sample. In S_2, the mean pole of F1 is N70E,41 and N249E49 for F2. However, the F2 set is composite and contains 2 sub poles families F2_a and F2_b.\nThe microstructures in S_2 are very similar to those of the core sample, with F1 sub-orthogonal to F2. Planes were adjusted on data from each structural set (Fig. 5\n.a, Fig. 5.b, Fig. 5.e). The relative angle between the mean F1 set (N82E, 46) and F2 set (N254E, 40) planes is estimated at 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00b0 for the core sample, which confirms the orthogonality of the sets (Fig. 5.d). On a smaller scale, in S_2, an angle of 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00b0 between F1 (N74E,60) and F2 (N238E,24) was found (Fig. 5.f).\nThe mean spacing for each set has been estimated from the spatial distribution of the adjusted planes. F1 has a denser distribution than F2 in the core sample with a mean spacing of 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mm, while F2 is characterized by a mean spacing of 6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0mm with a 95\u00a0% confidence interval. In S_2, F1 and F2 present a similar spatial distribution with a mean spacing of 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mm for F1 and 1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mm for F2. Furthermore, scale invariance in the structural networks is confirmed by calculating the fractal dimension of networks: 1.79 for the core sample and 1.83 for sample S_2.\n\n\n3.1.2\nMagmatic foliation analysis\nThe orientation of the magmatic foliation, restored through the analysis of the distribution of chromite grains, was estimated and compared to fracture sets F1 and F2 (Fig. 5). Despite a significant scattering of the magmatic foliation orientations in the core sample, they are better aligned with F1 and subsequently orthogonal to F2 (Fig. 5.c, Fig. 5.d). Indeed, the Kamb contour points out the significant clusters in the poles distribution of the chromite alignments (Kamb, 1959). Thus, the slight angle deviation between the F1 mean pole and the center of the highest Kamb contour, estimated at 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00b0, supports the alignment of F1 with the magmatic foliation. This result is also found at a smaller scale in sample S_2 (Fig. 5.e, Fig. 5.f).\n\n\n\n3.2\nPoro-permeability characterization\nThe gas permeability and total water porosity along the longitudinal axis of the core increase upwards along with weathering intensity. Three different zones can be outlined (Fig. 6\n.a,b): i) a first one defined by low porosity (<2.5\u00a0%) and low permeability (<1E-20\u00a0m2), ii) a transition zone then occurs where porosity increases from 3\u00a0% to 12\u00a0%, while the permeability increases from 1E-20\u00a0m2 to>1E-19\u00a0m2, iii) in the most weathered portion of the core sample, the porosity is relatively constant at about 13\u00a0%, while permeability is about 1.2E-19\u00a0m2.\nMercury porosimetry confirms the observed trends (Fig. 6.c, d). The bottom of the core sample is characterized by low porosity (<1%), while the top exhibits a higher porosity (>7%). Furthermore, the change in pore size distribution reveals that the increase in porosity results from the opening of nanometer pores (<50\u00a0nm). The connected porosity of the weathered part of the core sample (samples S_4 and S_7) is characterized at 90\u00a0% by nanopores with sizes ranging from 1.8\u00a0nm to 30\u00a0nm and a minor (10\u00a0%) family of micropores with sizes ranging from 4\u00a0\u03bcm to 80\u00a0\u03bcm. Conversely, the fresh part of the core sample (S_3 and S_5) is characterized by micropores ranging from 4\u00a0\u03bcm to 80\u00a0\u03bcm, accounting for 90\u00a0% to 100\u00a0% of the effective porosity. The minor family of nanopores, with sizes ranging from 1.8\u00a0nm to 30\u00a0nm, accounts for 0\u00a0% to 10\u00a0% of the porosity for S_3 and S_4. The sub-sample S_6 presents intermediate features with 70\u00a0% of the porosity due to nanopores and 30\u00a0% to micropores (Fig. 6.d).\n\n\n3.3\nElement redistribution\n\n3.3.1\nElement mapping\nThe Fe, Ni, and Mg XRF maps provide a good image of the microfracture network and their infillings at different scales. Ni is mainly present in fractures at each scale, while Si, Mg, and Fe dominate within the matrix (Fig. 7\n). Two distinct areas can be distinguished (Fig. 7.a, Fig. 7.b). The saprock zone exhibits an enrichment in Fe at the expense of Mg compared to the least weathered portion located below the line. In addition, the apparent density of Ni-bearing fractures is higher in the saprock (Fig. 7.a, Fig. 7.b). In the map obtained on S_1, located in the most weathered part of the ore sample, Ni occurs in both major and secondary fracture networks (Fig. 7.c). On the contrary, the map obtained on S_2, located in the least weathered part of the core sample, shows that Ni is solely present within the major fracture (Fig. 7.d).\nThe semi-quantitative Ni and Fe chemical maps support previous observations: Ni is mainly located in fractures where grades vary from ca. 5 to\u00a0>\u00a09\u00a0wt% (Fig. 8\n). In the weathered part, the matrix is richer in Ni (grades up to ca. 3\u00a0wt%). On the contrary, the Ni content drops from ca. 2\u00a0wt% Ni near the line to 1\u00a0wt% Ni in the freshest part of the sample (Fig. 8.a.1, Fig. 8.a.2). In sample S_2, the matrix is Ni poor with values close to the fresh rock (Fig. 8.a.4).\nThe Fe-map also displays two chemical domains for the core sample and sample S_2 (Fig. 8.b). The Fe-rich region occurs in the uppermost part of the core sample, closer to the top than the Ni-rich area (Fig. 8.b.1, Fig. 8.b.2). Fe content exceeds the 10\u00a0wt% in the weathered area and remains close to 8\u00a0wt% in fresher rock. Fractures are free of Fe, as underlined by the white arrows.\n\n\n\n3.4\nChemical profiles\nThe Ni, Fe, Mg, and Si chemical transect across the core sample reveals the geochemical impact of weathering at the cm-scale (Fig. 9\n.a, Fig. 9.b). To draw comparisons with systems at a larger scale, we report a geochemical log carried out along a drill core located in Cagou Pit (Fig. 9.c). From the least to most weathered part of the core sample (i.e. from bottom to top), Fe and Ni concentrations increase at the expense of Mg, while Si remains constant (Fig. 9.a). Three different zones are thus distinguished in the profile. The first one is characterized by low Ni (0.5\u00a0wt% \u2212 1\u00a0wt%) and Fe (7\u00a0wt%) concentrations and high Mg (27\u00a0wt%) and Si (20\u00a0wt%) concentrations. The second zone exhibits an increase in Ni up to 2\u00a0wt%, Fe up to 9 \u2013 10\u00a0wt%, and Mg decrease to 20\u00a0wt%. The third zone is associated with a sharp rise of Ni and Fe contents up to 3\u00a0wt% and 15\u00a0wt%, respectively, while the Mg content remains around 20\u00a0wt%. Whereas the broader trends represent the evolution of the matrix composition, Ni spikes result from microfractures. The analysis of the Ni signal in the transition zone using a Fast Fourier Transform reveals a periodicity of the spikes of 7\u00a0mm, similar to the estimated spacing of F1 (5\u00a0mm) and F2 (6\u00a0mm) in the core sample.\nAt a larger scale, the 30\u00a0m-long drill core crosses from bottom to top, i) peridotite rock (up to 26\u00a0m), ii) earthy saprolite interlayered with slightly weathered rock (from 26\u00a0m to 19\u00a0m), and (iii) earthy saprolite (up to 5\u00a0m). The drill core exhibits geochemical trends similar to those observed within the 30\u00a0cm-long core sample (Fig. 9.c). Specifically, from bottom to top, Fe and Ni concentrations increase at the expense of Mg, while Si remains constant at about 20\u00a0wt%. Furthermore, the three geochemical zones identified in the core sample are expressed at a larger scale along with the entire drill core.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nWeathering rate along the penetrating alteration front\nThe evolution of whole-rock density, porosity and permeability in the core sample corresponds to a petrophysical and chemical gradient from the quasi-fresh facies at the bottom to an advanced alteration state at the top. The main feature is a density decrease correlated to porosity increase. The measured petrophysical properties of the fresh rock (i.e., low porosity of\u00a0\u223c\u00a01\u00a0% and very low permeability\u00a0<\u00a01E-20\u00a0m2) are similar to those obtained on fresh Oman harzburgites (Dewandel et al., 2005; Katayama et al., 2020). Both peridotites are comparable in terms of chemistry and mineralogy (Al-Khirbash, 2015). Therefore, the properties of both Oman and New Caledonia ophiolite aquifers would be similar (Dewandel et al., 2017; Jeanpert, 2017).\nThe chemical evolution at the core sample scale is similar to that at the outcrop scale (Cathelineau et al., 2017; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019; Teitler et al., 2019). As attested by high Mg and Si bulk contents, the olivine remains preserved from dissolution in the fresh facies. Ni is locally present in the prominent fractures as newly-formed phyllosilicates within an almost unaltered matrix. The newly-formed phyllosilicates correspond to Mg-Ni talc-like, as already observed in previous studies from the same area (Cathelineau et al., 2017, 2016; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019). In the weathering front, the porosity and permeability increase with nanoporosity development. Mg and Si remain elevated, while Ni and Fe start to increase. Ni enrichments correspond to the two sub- orthogonal microfracture sets, e.g. F1 and F2. The FFT analysis from the Ni profile (zone (2)) reveals a spatial periodicity of 7\u00a0mm, which is close to the mean spacing of F1: 5\u00a0mm and F2: 6\u00a0mm. When weathering progresses, olivine dissolves and the bulk Fe and Ni content increase significantly while Mg decreases. Fe precipitates as goethite and serpentine (mostly lizardite) remains preserved (Myagkiy et al., 2017; Teitler et al., 2019). Ni enrichment mainly occurs in the fractures and within the micro-fractured matrix in the altered zone. At this weathering stage, the porosity is relatively high (around 10\u00a0%), and the nanopores account for almost all the connected porosity.\n\n\n4.2\nElement redistribution on fractures network\nThe distribution of three different weathering rates in the core sample results from several processes that are not all synchronous (Fig. 9.b). When the olivine dissolution front progresses downwards, a part of magnesium and nickel is trapped by the precipitation of phyllosilicates such as Mg-Ni talc-like (Cathelineau et al., 2017, 2016; Myagkiy et al., 2017). These secondary minerals are richer in Si and Ni and poorer in Mg than the original silicates, explaining thus the enrichments. The precipitation of Fe-oxy-hydroxides fixes iron (Fe3+). Ni excess migrates following the fracture network towards deeper, poorly weathered levels. This migration ahead of the dissolution front saturates fractures, creating the transition area observed in the core sample. Ni enrichment occurs mainly in the vicinity of the main microfractures, within the dense network of serpentine microcracks that forms the so-called \u201cmesh\u201d structure (Cathelineau et al., 2017; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019). In this area, silicates are mostly un-weathered. The dissolution-precipitation process triggers the bulk permeability increase with the nanopore formation. Thus, a transition occurs from diffusion- to advection-driven reaction front at the sub-mm scale. The nanopores are probably controlled by the distribution of serpentine and its nano-defects. Therefore, in increasingly serpentinized rocks, the nano-defects may affect the distribution of nanopores (Tutolo et al., 2016). Dewandel et al. (2005) also reported a similar pore size distribution on fresh peridotites from Oman and interpreted it related to the serpentine vein microstructures. Our data indicate that the weathering processes can also contribute to the nanoporosity formation in serpentinized peridotite. Inherited nano defects may probably explain the enhanced nanoporosity development. In addition, the supergene weathering of the serpentine and the opening of inherited serpentine microfracture and their infilling by newly formed phyllosilicates both impact the pore size distribution. The dissolution front favors the onset of nanopores, which extends it to the whole sample.\nThis redistribution model highlights the impact of pre-existing fracture networks, which act as preferential pathways for the Ni-Mg-Si transfers and their reprecipitation as newly formed minerals.\n\n\n4.3\nMultiscale redistribution processes\nThe structural organization of the fracture network and the chromite layering of both core sample and sample S_2 exhibits a predominant fracture set (F1) parallel to the chromite alignments and a second set (F2) sub-orthogonal to F1. Previous studies have highlighted the link between chromite layering and magmatic foliation (Cassard et al., 1981; Cluzel et al., 2012; Prinzhofer et al., 1980) and have suggested an NS striking orientation for such lineation (Cluzel et al., 2012). Furthermore, this lineation would be relicts of the oceanic lithosphere (Cluzel et al., 2012). Thus, a geometric link between the fracture network and the magmatic bedding could be inferred, with F1 oriented parallel to the magmatic lineation and F2 orthogonal to such orientation. Besides, recent studies point out that fractures filled by primary serpentine (lizardite) are also inherited from relicts of the oceanic lithosphere (Cathelineau et al., 2017; Iseppi et al., 2018; Quesnel et al., 2016). In addition, such an inherited fracture network often displays sub-orthogonal sets of fractures striking N0-20\u00b0E, N50-70\u00b0E, N90-100\u00b0E and N120-140\u00b0E with variable dips from 20 to 90\u00b0 (Iseppi, 2018; Iseppi et al., 2018). Such a common origin of the magmatic lineation and the inherited fracture network, combined with a similar orientation between such structures, may allow suggesting an orientation of the fracture network in the core sample close to what has been described by Iseppi et al. (2018). A similar structural organization occurs on larger scales (Fig. 10\n). Sub-orthogonal fracture sets from the Cagou and the Test pit (Fig. 1.b) are described from mm to 10\u00a0m scale. At the outcrop scale (1\u00a0m to 10\u00a0m), Cathelineau et al. (2016) also describe sub-orthogonal structures for Ni talc-like crack-seal fractures with two strike families of N150\u00b0 and N50\u00b0 at the Cagou pit. At the massif scale, such as the example of Koniambo, four dominant fracture sets strike N0\u00b0, N45\u00b0, N90\u00b0 and N135\u00b0 (Jeanpert et al., 2019; Quesnel et al., 2016). The serpentine fracture network is characterized by an N130\u00b0 dominant trend associated with N90\u00b0, N45\u00b0 and N0\u00b0 directions (Iseppi et al., 2018). This general structural organization at the island scale shows two different sets of two sub-orthogonal families (N0\u00b0 associated with N90\u00b0 and N45\u00b0 associated with N130\u00b0). Thus, it is proposed that a specific structural organization including one to two sub orthogonal sets of fracture striking N0\u00b0 \u2013 N90\u00b0 and N45\u00b0 \u2013 N135\u00b0 would be developed at different scales, which suggests that similar structural processes would have occurred to constrain the system. A fractal dimension estimated on the core sample and the sub-sample S_2 can be proposed at around 1.8 to quantify the self-similarity of the fracture network.\n(Jeanpert et al., 2019) have already pointed out the relationship between fracture distribution and permeability at the outcrop scale. Our core-scale analysis supports this scaling effect on permeability. At the decimeter scale, the permeability of a fresh peridotite is estimated around 1e-15\u00a0m2. Such value is far higher than the measured permeability in the core sample, i.e. between 1e-21\u00a0m2 and 1e-19\u00a0m2. Instead, such permeability would result from fractures with a spacing of 0.35\u00a0m (Fig. 10), yielding an aperture of 1.6e-5\u00a0m using a cubic law (Jeanpert, 2017). Similarly, at the 10\u00a0m scale, the permeability increases up to 1e-13\u00a0m2 \u2212 1e-11\u00a0m2, which is interpreted as draining fractures with a spacing of 30\u00a0m and an aperture of 1.5e-3\u00a0m, consistent with in situ observations (Fig. 10).\nThis self-similarity in the structural organization at the different scales is also observed in the different weathering stages. Specifically, at the sample scale, this study highlights that the progression of the silicate dissolution front through a fracture network results in the redistribution of Ni and the development of different weathering facies within a few tens of centimetres. Such a gradation of the weathering products is also observed at the outcrop scale. The base of the lateritic profile usually includes a transition domain, up to a few meters in thickness, where Ni-rich fractures crosscut the unaltered bedrock. Upwards, this transition domain is delimited by the silicate dissolution front. In the saprolite above the front, secondary phyllosilicates formed away from the primary mineralized fractures (Cathelineau et al., 2016). The chemical (this study) and mineralogical (previous studies at the same location: Cathelineau et al. (2017; 2016); Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2019); Teitler et al. (2019)) evolutions observed in lateritic profiles mimic, at a larger scale, the cm-scale processes observed in the core sample. In particular, the Ni distribution between the fractures and the saprolite matrix is similar at both scales. Thus, an average Ni grade in the saprolite ore is about 2\u20135\u00a0wt% (Butt and Cluzel, 2013), while Mg-Ni talc-like veins grade over 10\u00a0wt% (Cathelineau et al., 2017).\nThe chemical profile acquired on the core sample can thus be compared with drill core assay data (Fig. 9). Indeed, when the log presents a continuous weathering process, the geochemical trends observed at the scale of a few decimeters are similar to those found commonly in the saprolite zone of ultramafic-derived lateritic profiles (Teitler et al., 2019) (Fig. 9.b). Such structural, weathering and geochemical similarities observed from 1e to 3\u00a0m to 10\u00a0m scale highlight the impact of fractures network on weathering and redistribution processes at each observation scale. Hence a better understanding of the structural organization of the sample could provide light on the spatial geochemical distribution.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nThis study presents a multiscale approach combining structural, petrophysical, and geochemical analysis. The goal was to study the impact of the structural organization on the weathering processes and the Ni redistribution at different scales to discuss the similarities. Observation conducted at a small scale gives insight into the general mechanisms typical of the whole lateritic profiles. The main findings are:\n\n-\nWeathering and Ni-enrichment are fracture controlled. The magmatic foliation guided the development of the serpentine networks, which constitute the active network favoring the penetration of meteoric waters. The main tectonics lineations observed in the Cagou sample and at the scale of Koniambo massif are NS, EW, NWSE, and SWNE. Microfracture sets are organized similarly at the sample scale and the open pit scale or even larger scale. This scale invariance suggests a common origin of the fracture networks, confirmed by their similar serpentine infillings and fractal distribution.\n\n\n-\nThe proposed multi-step Ni-redistribution at the core scale is consistent with existing chemical profiles in laterites. Fractures constitute sites of early fixation of Ni as newly-formed Mg-Ni- phyllosilicates. The reactivated serpentine microfractures are the primary enrichment locus before a bulk nickel redistribution by the dissolution front.\n\n\n-\nThe increase in porosity results from several superimposed processes: i) mesopore formation through olivine dissolution, ii) partial to full infilling of the pores by newly formed minerals such as neoformed phyllosilicates and smectite described in previous works (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019; Teitler et al., 2019). The newly formed phases display a remarkable high content of nanopores. Further studies will be needed to determine the increase of the nanoporosity as it may affect the redistribution processes at a microscopic scale by favoring diffusion over advection.\n\n\n-\nThe weathering fronts observed at a small scale on a core sample are excellent analogues of the larger scale laterite profiles. In such profiles, the inherited fracture networks filled by serpentine developed in earlier stages and depend on magmatic microtextures and subduction-obduction history. They constitute the Ni-trap and show fractal dimensions.\n\n\n-\nThe Ni-redistribution results from a hierarchical and multi-scale organization related to the previous deformation. The self-similarity of spatial distribution patterns implies scaling laws. The evaluation of upscaling laws would, in consequence, open up great opportunities for designing reliable large-scale model geometry and better predictive models of Ni-mineralization location.\n\n\n\n\n","15":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou (SYG) Pb-Zn metallogenic province, located in the western Yangtze Block, southwest China (Fig. 1\na), is one of the most important Pb-Zn metallogenic belts in the world (Zhou et al., 2001, 2013c; Han et al., 2007a; Hu and Zhou, 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2019). The province contains more than 400 carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits, including one giant Pb-Zn deposit (Huize) with 7 Mt Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn metal reserves, eight large Pb-Zn deposits (Daliangzi, Wusihe, Maoping, Tianbaoshan, Lehong, Maozu, Maliping and Jinshachang) with 1\u20133 Mt Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn metal reserves, and more than 40 medium scale Pb-Zn deposits with 0.2 to 1 Mt Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn metal reserves. The mining history in this area is more than 100\u00a0years and the identified resources in SYG Pb-Zn metallogenic province in the past decade account for over 27\u00a0% of the newly increased reserves in China (Liu and Lin, 1999; Hu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b).\nIn the past several decades, geologists have carried out a lot of studies on these deposits in SYG Pb-Zn metallogenic province, mainly focusing on studying regional geology and metallogenic epoch to discuss tectonic setting (Zhou et al., 2013e; Zhang et al., 2015), analyzing isotopic compositions to trace sources of ore-forming fluids and materials (Han et al., 2007a; Zhou et al., 2013d, 2014; Luo et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020), and determining fluid inclusions to reconstruct ore-forming processes (Han et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2017, 2019; Luo et al., 2019). These studies show that almost all Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province are hosted in the Neopeoterozic-Paleozoic carbonate sequences (Fig. 1b), and have similar alteration type and mineral paragenesis (Shao and Li, 1996; Liu and Lin, 1999; Huang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2015), implying these deposits are formed in the same tectonic setting and have similar genetic type. However, due to different opinions on the timing of mineralization and the source of ore-forming fluids and materials, the genesis of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit in SYG Pb-Zn metallogenic province are still debatable, hindering further prospecting in this area. For example, Wu (2013) obtained a calcite Sm-Nd age of 204.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma for Daliangzi deposit, which are consistent the fluorite Sm-Nd (200.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2\u00a0Ma; Zhang et al., 2015) and sphalerite Rb-Sr (206.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0Ma; Zhou et al., 2015) age for Jinshachang deposit, sphalerite Rb-Sr age for Lehong deposit (200.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3\u00a0Ma; Zhang et al., 2014), calcite Sm-Nd age for Maozu deposit (196\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma; Zhou et al., 2013b), and sphalerite Rb-Sr age for Paoma deposit(200.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0Ma; Lin et al., 2010), implying the Pb-Zn mineralization in SYG metallogenic province occurred in Late Triassic. However, Liu et al. (2018) yielded a sphalerite Rb-Sr age of 345.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0Ma for Daliangzi deposit, close to the spahlerite Rb-Sr age for Tianbaoshan (348.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2\u00a0Ma; Wang, 2018) and Maoping deposit (321.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8\u00a0Ma; Shen et al., 2016), indicating they are formed in Carboniferous. Furthermore, Li et al. (2007) and Yin et al. (2009) determined calcite Sm-Nd age of 225\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9\u00a0Ma and sphalerite Rb-Sr age of 225.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma, respectively.\nThe Daxiao is a medium-sized Pb-Zn deposit with mean grades of 29.52\u00a0wt% Pb and 5.71\u00a0wt% Zn. It is a typical carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit located in western part of SYG Pb-Zn metallogenic province, close to the word-class Huize carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit (Fig. 1b). Up to now, there is only one research on the mineralogy and fluid inclusions of this deposit (Nong et al., 2017). The mineralization time, sources of ore-forming fluids and materials, and ore-forming processes of Daxiao deposit are still unclear, hindering the further prospecting in this deposit. Here, based on detailed investigation on deposit geology, we report sphalerite Rb-Sr age and HOS-Pb isotopic compositions to reveal the mineralization time and the sources of ore-forming fluids and materials for Daxiao carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit. In addition, Daxiao deposit is developed in the Heishan formation of Kunyang group, which is one of the oldest strata in SYG metallogenic province. Hence, this study can provide more evidences for the genesis of the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province and is expected to help us to better understand the regional metallogenic regularity in the area.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Yangtze Block is bounded by the Sanjiang Orogenic Belt in the southwest, Qinling-Dabie Orogenic Belt in the north, and the Cathaysia Block in the southeast (Fig. 1a). It is composed of Archean and Paleoproterozoic metamorphic crystalline basement (Qiu et al., 2000; Gao et al., 2011), which are unconformably covered by Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary and igneous sequences (Sun et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012a, Wang et al., 2012b, Wang et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2019). The magmatism and related mineralization are significantly controlled by surrounding tectonic activities. For example, the Cenozoic collision orogeny in the west developed a giant alkali-rich porphyry belt and related Cu-Au-Mo mineralization (Hou and Zhang, 2015; Li et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2021).\nThe western Yangtze Block, where the SYG Pb-Zn metallogenic province located, also mainly consist of Archean to Neoproterozoic metamorphic basement, and Paleozoic to Cenozoic igneous and sedimentary cover succession. The Archean basement are represented by Kunyang Group metamorphic rocks with zircon U-Pb ages of\u00a0\u223c\u00a03.3 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a02.9\u00a0Ga (Qiu et al., 2000). The Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic basement is comprised of Dongchuan (\u223c1.7 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.5\u00a0Ga) and Huili\/Kunyang (\u223c1.2 to 0.9\u00a0Ga) groups, including greywacke, slate, siliceous and carbonaceous sedimentary rocks (Zhou et al., 2018b). They are widely intruded by Neoproterozoic ultramafic\u2013mafic and felsic intrusions (Zhou et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2012a, Wang et al., 2012b). The cover sequences of western Yangtze Block are mainly composed of Cambrian to Triassic shallow marine and Jurassic to Cenozoic continental sedimentary rocks, as well as late Permian basalts of the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP). The Cambrian to Triassic shallow marine sedimentary strata are dominated by sandstone, shale and limestone, locally interlayered with siltstone, marls and dolostone (Zhou et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2019). Jurassic to Cenozoic continental strata are dominated by conglomerate and sandstone (Liu and Lin, 1999).\nThe metallogenesis in the western Yangtze Block is represented by Pb-Zn mineralization, forming more than 400 Pb-Zn deposits, which are entirely hosted in Neoproterozoic to Permian carbonate rocks, commonly controlled by thrust faults (Zheng and Wang, 1991; Zhou et al., 2013a; Tang et al., 2019). Most faults in the eastern part of SYG metallogenic province are trend NE and NW (Fig. 1b), such as Zhaotong-Qujing, Weining-Shuicheng and Mile-Shizong faults, whereas those in the west are trend NS, such as Xiaojiang and Anninghe faults. These carbonate-host Pb-Zn deposits are characterized with weak alteration, simple mineralogy, higher Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn grade and abundant associated elements (e.g., Ag, Ge, Cd and Ga; Han et al., 2007a, Zhou et al., 2011).\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the Daxiao deposit\nThe exposed strata in the Daxiao carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit are Neoproterozoic Kunyang group, including slate interbedded with volcanic tuff of Fuliangpeng formation, argillaceous dolomite interbedded with slate of Heishan formation, and slate of Etouchang formation, and quaternary sediments (Fig. 2\na). The Heishan formation, with thickness of 250\u00a0\u223c\u00a01768\u00a0m, crops out in most part of the deposit, and is the main host rock for the Pb-Zn orebodies. Whereas the Fuliangpeng formation, with thickness of 96\u00a0\u223c\u00a0256\u00a0m, and Etouchang formation, with thickness of 861\u00a0\u223c\u00a01786\u00a0m, exposed in the southwestern and northeastern part of the deposit, respectively (Fig. 2a). The magmatic rocks in the Daxiao ore district developed not well, with no outcrop of intermediate-acid intrusive rocks. Only the volcanic tuff interlayer in the slate of Fuliangpeng formation exposed in the southwest. The faults developed in Daxiao deposit trend NW (F1) and E (F2 and F3), significantly affected by regional tectonic activities. Among them, the F1 and F2 show a close relationship with the orebodies, which are probably the ore-controlling faults (Fig, 2a, b).\nIn total 23 orebodies were identified in the Daxiao ore district, occurring as stratiform veins (Fig. 2b, 3a) and massive lenticulars (Fig. 3\nb, c), and mainly filled into interlayer fractures. Locally, the mineralization developed as stockworks in slate with fine-grained sulfides as well (Fig. 3d). The orebodies extend from east to west, with length varying from 84.0\u00a0\u223c\u00a0301.2\u00a0m and thickness of 3.97\u00a0\u223c\u00a05.03\u00a0m. The Pb grade of these orebodies is 26.80\u00a0\u223c\u00a032.69\u00a0wt%, and the Zn grade is 2.37\u00a0\u223c\u00a010.60\u00a0wt%. Furthermore, the orebodies in Daxiao deposit also contain abundant associated Ag, with grade of 60\u00a0\u223c\u00a0100\u00a0g\/t. The ore type is dominated by primary sulfide ore with a few secondary oxide ore. Minerals of sulfide ore mainly include galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and argentite (Fig. 3d, e). And that of oxide ore mainly include smithsonite, anglesite, cerussite and limonite (Fig. 3f), which are formed by the oxidation of sulfides, such as sphalerite, galena and pyrite, respectively. The associated gangue minerals are relatively simple, consisted of dolomite, calcite and quartz. In general, the minerals formed in the early stage are crosscut by that formed in the late stage (Fig. 3g-i), indicating multi-stage mineralization in Daxiao deposit.\n\n\n2.3\nAlteration and mineral paragenesis\nBased on detailed investigation of petrography, paragenetic assemblages of minerals and crosscutting relationships, three main stages that the Daxiao deposit underwent have been recognized (Fig. 4\n), including (I) syn-sedimentary stage (dolomite \u2013 calcite \u2013 pyrite); (II) hydrothermal stage (dolomite \u2013 calcite \u2013 pyrite \u2013 quartz \u2013 sphalerite \u2013 chalcopyrite \u2013 galena \u2013 argentite) and (III) supergene stage (smithsonite \u2013 anglesite \u2013 cerussite \u2013 limonite \u2013 quartz \u2013 calcite).\nThe syn-sedimentary stage is characterized by disseminated fine-grained euhedral to subhedral pyrite associated with dolomitization and marbleization. These pyrites, calcites and dolomites are generally crosscut or overprinted by later chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite (Fig. 5\na-c). The hydrothermal stage refers to the main mineralization stage characterized by abundant sulfides, accompanying with lesser dolomite, calcite and quartz. This stage can be further divided into early hydrothermal substage and late hydrothermal substage. In the early hydrothermal substage, the sulfides are dominated by euhedral-subhedral sphalerite, associated with lesser chalcopyrite, galena and euhedral pyrite (Fig. 5d, e). Locally, chalcopyrite develops in sphalerite as exsolution lamellae (Fig. 5e, f). Whereas the sulfides in late hydrothermal substage are dominated by galena, associated with lesser chalcopyrite and anhedral sphalerite and pyrite. The sphalerite and pyrite in the early hydrothermal stage generally crosscut or altered by the galena and chalcopyrite in the late hydrothermal substage (Fig. 5e-g). Besides, argentite in the late hydrothermal substage developed in the galena and calcite locally (Fig. 5h). The supergene stage is represented by extensive oxidation of sulfides, and a small amount of quartz and calcite. Such as galena was oxidized to anglesite and cerussite (Fig. 5i-k), sphalerite was oxidized to smithsonite (Fig. 3f), and pyrite was oxidized to limonite in the fractures of dolomite and calcite (Fig. 5l).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\nSamples were collected from different mineralization stages and positions of Daxiao carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn ore district for analysis. The sampling location of some samples are shown in Fig. 2. Pyrite, sphalerite, galena and quartz separates were handpicked under a binocular microscope after ore samples crushed to 40 \u2013 80 meshes. The purity of these mineral separates were more than 99\u00a0%. And then all mineral separates were cleaned with ultrapure water in an ultrasonic bath before being powdered in an agate mortar. Among them, quartz separates were analyzed for HO isotopic compositions, sphalerite separates for Rb-Sr isotopic dating, and sphalerite, galena and pyrite separates for S-Pb isotopic compositions.\nFive sphalerite samples from early hydrothermal stage were collected for Rb-Sr isotopic dating. The sphalerite separates were crushed to 40 meshes and then handpicked under a binocular microscope. Chemical separation of Rb and Sr from matrix elements, and mass spectrometric measurement were conducted at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The separation and purification of Rb and Sr were performed with cation exchange resin columns after dissolved. Detailed description of the procedure for the analyses of Rb-Sr isotope is available in Li et al. (2005). The isotopic ratios were measured on an IsoProbe-T mass spectrometer, equipped with seventeen collectors including nine Faraday cups, seven ion counter receivers, and one Daly receiver. The mass fractionation of Sr isotope was calibrated by 88Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a08.37521. The average 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of standard solution NBS-987 is 0.710242\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Uncertainties (2\u03c3) of the Rb-Sr isotopic analyses are 0.005\u00a0% for Sr isotopic compositions and 2\u00a0% for 87Rb\/86Sr ratios.\nNine quartz separates, including two from early hydrothermal stage, four from late hydrothermal stage and three from supergene stage, were selected for HO isotopic analyses, which were accomplished at the Beijing Institute of Uranium Geology using a MAT-253 Mass Spectrometer\u00b7H2O was obtained through vacuum thermal decrepitation (at 550\u00a0\u00b0C) of the fluids extracted from the inclusions hosted in the quartz, and then, using a Zn reagent reduced to H2 for the H isotope analysis. The cleaned quartz separates were reacted with ultrapure BrF5 at 500 \u2013 680\u00a0\u00b0C in vacuum (10-3 Pa) for 14\u00a0h to release O2. The O2 was reacted with plumbago using a Platinum catalyst (at 700\u00a0\u00b0C) to create CO2 for O isotope analysis. The analysis results are reported relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) as \u03b4DSMOW and \u03b418OSMOW, with uncertainties of 1\u00a0\u2030 (1\u03c3) for \u03b4D and 0.2\u00a0\u2030 (1\u03c3) for \u03b418O, respectively.\nFive pyrite separates from syn-sedimentary stage, nine pyrite, nine sphalerite and sixteen galena separates from hydrothermal stage were collected for the analyses of sulfur isotopic compositions. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite, sphalerite and galena were determined using Euro3000 mass spectrometer at the Beijing Insititute of Uranium Geology. Ag2S named GBW 04,415 and GBW 04,414 were used as external standards, with accuracy of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u2030 (2\u03c3). The results of sulfur isotopic compositions are reported relative to CDT.\nSeven sphalerite from early hydrothermal substage and four galena from late hydrothermal substage were selected for lead isotope analyses. The analysis of lead isotopic composition was carried out at the Beijing Institute of Uranium Geology using the GV Isoprobe-T Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer. After dissolution by HCl and HClO4, the separation and purification of Pb were performed with HBr and anion exchange resin columns. The obtained 207Pb\/206Pb value of the standard NBS 981 was 0.91458\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00012 (2\u03c3), well consistent with the reference value (0.91464\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00033; Belshaw et al., 1998). The internal precision of the analysis for Pb isotope ratios was better than 0.1\u00a0%.\n\n\n4\nAnalytical results\n\n4.1\nRb-Sr isotope compositions and isochron age\nFive sphalerite from early hydrothermal stage in Daxiao deposit are collected for Rb-Sr isotopic analysis, with results shown in Table 1\n. These separates have Rb and Sr concentration of 0.028 \u2013 0.975\u00a0ppm and 0.116 \u2013 4.247\u00a0ppm, respectively. The 87Rb\/86Sr ratios of them show a wide range from 0.02 to 11.94. While the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios are relatively homogenous, ranging from 0.711003 to 0.748912. The Rb-Sr isotopic analyses yield an Rb-Sr isochron age of 223.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma, with an initial 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.71093\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00025 and MSWD value of 0.101 (Fig. 6\n).\n\n\n4.2\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes\nThe analytical results for HO isotopes of quartz from Daxiao are presented in Table 2\n. Equilibrium fluid isotopic composition of quartz was calculated using the fractional equilibrium formulae proposed by Zheng and Chen (2000). The crystallization temperatures of quartz were based on Nong et al. (2017) and our microthermometric results of fluid inclusions (unpublished data). The \u03b4Dfluid and calculated \u03b418Ofluid values are listed in Table 2 as well. The \u03b4Dfluid and \u03b418Ofluid values of early hydrothermal stage are \u221268.5 to \u221267.2\u00a0\u2030 (average of \u221267.9\u00a0\u2030), and 4.1 to 5.3\u00a0\u2030 (average of 4.7\u00a0\u2030), respectively. And those of late hydrothermal stage range from \u221269.6 to \u221265.8\u00a0\u2030 (average of \u221267.6\u00a0\u2030) and 3.4 to 5.6\u00a0\u2030 (average of 4.2\u00a0\u2030), respectively. Whilst in the supergene stage, the \u03b4Dfluid values are varying from \u221268.3 to \u221265.8\u00a0\u2030 (average of \u221266.8\u00a0\u2030), and the \u03b418Ofluid values are from \u22124.1 to \u22121.7\u00a0\u2030 (average of \u22123.1\u00a0\u2030). It is noteworthy that, from early hydrothermal stage to supergene stage, the \u03b4Dfluid values are relatively consistent, while the \u03b418Ofluid values show an obvious trend of decrease.\n\n\n4.3\nSulfur isotope\nSulfur isotopic compositions of sulfides in different stages from Daxiao deposit are listed in Table 3\n. The pyrite from syn-sedimentary stage show relative high \u03b434S values with a wide range of 14.8 \u2013 19.1\u00a0\u2030 (mean 17.2\u00a0\u2030). while the pyrite, sphalerite and galena from hydrothermal stage (including early hydrothermal stage pyrite and sphalerite, and late hydrothermal stage pyrite and galena) have a narrow \u03b434S range of 6.3 \u2013 9.7\u00a0\u2030 (mean 8.0\u00a0\u2030), significantly lower than that of syn-sedimentary stage.\n\n\n4.4\nLead isotope\nThe Pb isotopic ratios of early hydrothermal stage sphalerite and late hydrothermal stage galena from Daxiao deposit are listed in Table 4\n. The 206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios of early hydrothermal stage sphalerite are 18.282 \u2013 18.312 (average of 18.297), 15.603 \u2013 15.681(average of 15.637) and 38.287 \u2013 38.311 (average of 38.299), respectively. While those of late hydrothermal stage galena are 18.315 \u2013 18.491 (average of 18.361), 15.676 \u2013 15.721 (average of 15.698) and 38.314 \u2013 38.326 (average of 38.318), respectively.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTiming of Daxiao carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization\nThe timing of mineralization has been one of the most significant obstacle hindering the undersatanding of the genesis of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits (Leach et al., 2001). That is to say, it is very difficult to find a precise dating method for carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits because the minerals in which have low concentrations of the natural radioactive isotopes. In recent years, with the development of analytical technology, Rb-Sr isotopic dating of sulfides has been demonstrated to be a reliable method for determining mineralization age, widely used in the studies of hydrothermal deposits (e.g., Nakai et al., 1990; Christensen et al., 1995; Petke and Diamond, 1996; Li et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2018).\nAs illustrated in Fig. 6, the Rb-Sr isotopic age of the early hydrothermal stage sphalerite from Daxiao deposit is 223.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.101). Besides, 1\/Sr values do not co-vary with 87Rb\/86Sr and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of samples (Fig. 7\n), indicating that the isochron age is reliable and represents the mineralization age of Daxiao carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit (e.g., Nakai et al., 1993; Lin et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2013e). Previous studies have proved that the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in SYG metallogenic province lasted from Devonian to Jurassic (e.g., Yin et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2013c; 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2016). For example, Xiong et al. (2018) yielded the oldest sphalerite Rb-Sr isochron age of 411\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0Ma in Wusihe deposit. And Zhang et al. (2005) yield the youngest illite K-Ar isochron age of 176.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0Ma in Huize deposit. However, most carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province were formed in Late Trassic to Early Jurassic (ca. 225 \u2013 190\u00a0Ma; Fig. 8\n), representing the spike of Pb-Zn mineralization in this district. The Rb-Sr isotopic age of the early hydrothermal stage sphalerite is 223.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma, indicating the Daxiao carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit is one of the products of the Pb-Zn mineralization in Late Trassic.\n\n\n5.2\nSources of ore-forming fluids and materials\nH and O isotopic compositions of fluids trapped in the inclusions in hydrothermal minerals can be used to trace the sources of hydrothermal fluids (Hedenquist and Richards, 1998; Meinert et al., 2003, 2005; Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a, Wang et al., 2018b). For carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization system, there are four possible geological fluid reservoirs, including magmatic water, metamorphic water, basinal brine and meteoric water (Kesler et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2013c; Liu et al., 2017; Shu et al., 2017). The quartz samples in early hydrothermal stage and late hydrothermal stage have similar \u03b4Dfluid and \u03b418Ofluid values (Table 2), both plotted in or near the metamorphic water field, and near the magmatic water field as well. Considering the fact that there was no magmatism in this area in Late Triassic, these results indicate the ore-forming fluids in hydrothermal stage are probably dominated by metamorphic water. While the \u03b4Dfluid values of the quartz samples in supergene stage are relative higher than that in hydrothermal stage, and the \u03b418Ofluid values are relative lower, falling near the brine of Sichuan Basin and meteoric water and far away the magmatic water and metamorphic water filed (Fig. 9\n). This indicates that abundant basinal brine or meteoric water had mixed into ore-forming fluid during its evolution from hydrothermal stage to supergene stage, resulting that the proportion of metamorphic water in ore-forming fluid decreasing significantly.\nSulfur is the most important mineralization material in the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits. Like most carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits, the sulfide minerals from syn-sedimentary stage and hydrothermal stage in Daxiao deposit are mainly consisted of pyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. The absence of sulfate implies that the \u03b434S values of sulfides approximate the the \u03b434S values of ore-forming fluid (Ohmoto et al., 1990; Seal, 2006; Basuki et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2013d). In Daxiao deposit, \u03b434S values of the pyrite samples from syn-sedimentary stage are 14.8 \u2013 19.1\u00a0\u2030 (Table 3 and Fig. 10\na), obviously higher than that of magmatic hydrothermal (-3 to 1\u00a0\u2030) and near that of the seawater in Neoproterozoic (ca. 17 \u2013 22\u00a0\u2030; Fig. 10b). It indicates that the sulfur of ore-forming fluid in syn-sedimentary stage was probably reduced from the seawater sulfate hosted in marine sedimentary strata. Based on the previous studies, both bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) and thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) could convert marine sulfates to reduced sulfur in hydrothermal system (Seal, 2006; Hoefs, 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a). Due to BSR generally takes place at relatively low temperature (below 120\u00a0\u00b0C, mainly 50 \u2013 70\u00a0\u00b0C), and generates negative \u03b434S values with a wide S isotopic fractionation range (Dixon and Davidson, 1996; Basuki et al., 2008). Hence, BSR can be excluded in Daxiao deposit because it doesn\u2019t conform to geological facts that the positive \u03b434S values and medium to high homogeneous temperature of ca. 170 \u2013 190\u00a0\u00b0C (Nong et al., 2017; Pan and Chang, 2020). Meanwhile, TSR occurs under relatively high temperature (generally above 150\u00a0\u00b0C), and would produce large amounts of reduced sulfur with a narrow range of \u03b434S values (Ohmoto et al., 1990; Worden et al., 1995; Basuki et al., 2008). The \u039434Ssulfate-sulfide generated by TSR process could be as high as\u00a0+\u00a010 to\u00a0+\u00a025\u00a0\u2030 (Ohmoto and Goldhaber, 1997; Basuki et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2008). Both the temperature conditions and isotopic results of TSR are well consistent with the geological facts in Daxiao deposit, suggesting that the sulfur in syn-sedimentary stage was mainly reduced from marine sulfate in sedimentary strata by TSR process in a nearly closed system (Machel et al., 1995; Luo et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). In the hydrothermal stage, \u03b434S values of the sulfur in ore-forming fluid have a narrow range of 6.3 \u2013 9.7\u00a0\u2030 (Table 3), significantly lower than those of syn-sedimentary stage and plotting between seawater sulfur and magmatic hydrothermal sulfur (Fig. 10b). Considering the fact that there is no contemporaneous magmatism in this region, the sulfur in hydrothermal stage was probably formed by the reduction of sulfate in sedimentary strata through TSR process in an open system. In open system, ore-forming fluids migrate and circle in the thrustfold system, extracting and reducing sulfates not only from host rock, but also from the other strata. When the \u03b434S values of host rocks higher than regional sedimentary strata, the \u03b434S values of sulfides are generally significantly lower than that of regional sedimentary strata (e.g., Daxiao, Maozu, Maliping; Fig. 10b). While, when the \u03b434S values of host rocks lower than regional sedimentary strata, the \u03b434S values of sulfides are generally close to, or even higher than that of regional sedimentary strata (e.g., Huize, Fule; Fig. 10b).\nConsidering the facts that the relatively similar geochemical behavior of Pb and Zn elements in hydrothermal fluids and little radiogenic Pb isotopes in sulfides, the Pb isotopic analysis of sulfides was usually used to reveal the metal sources of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit (Zhou et al., 2013a; Pass et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019). As listed in Table 4, the Pb isotopic compositions of sphalerite and galena in hydrothermal stage from Daxiao deposit vary within a narrow range and show an obvious linear trend in both 207Pb\/204Pb vs 206Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb vs 206Pb\/204Pb plots (Fig. 11\na, b), probably implying a mixed source (Mirnejad et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2019). In order to trace the metal sources of Daxiao deposit, the Pb isotopic data of regional igneous rocks (Emeishan flood basalts), basement rocks (Kunyang and Huili groups) and sedimentary wall rocks (Sinian to Triassic strata) have been collected (Table 5\n). In the diagrams of 207Pb\/204Pb vs 206Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb vs 206Pb\/204Pb (Fig. 11a, b), Daxiao deposit and other representative Pb-Zn deposits, such as Huize, Maozu, Fule and Maliping deposits, mainly plot in the overlapping area of Emeishan flood basalts, Kunyang and Huili groups and Sinian to Triassic strata, indicating that Emeishan flood basalts, Kunyang and Huili groups and Sinian to Triassic strata maybe jointly contributed the ore-forming metals for these Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province. Notably, almost all Pb isotopic data points of Daxiao plot above the orogen growth curve and near the upper crustal growth curve (Fig. 11), representing ore-forming metals mainly from orogenic belt and upper crust, corresponding to metamorphic basement of Kunyang and Huili groups and sedimentary wall rocks of Sinian to Triassic strata, respectively. Furthermore, from early hydrothermal stage sphalerite and late hydrothermal stage galena, the evolution trends of 207Pb\/204Pb vs 206Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb vs 206Pb\/204Pb are close to upper crustal growth curve from orogeny growth curve (Fig. 11a, b), implying sedimentary wall rocks of Sinian to Triassic strata contributed more metals during the evolution of ore-forming fluid.\n\n\n5.3\nA possible metallogenic model\nFocusing on the genesis of the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposit in SYG metallogenic province, several possible genetic models have been proposed by previous researchers. Chen (2002) and He et al. (2006) put forward a Sedex model according to the geological feature that stratabound Pb-Zn mineralization widely developed. And Li et al. (2007) suggest a model of Emeishan mantle plume driven considering the fact that Emeishan basalts extensively distributed in SYG metallogenic province. However, as illustrated in Fig. 8, the isotopic geochronological data for Daxiao and other carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits show that the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in SYG metallogenic province was concentrated in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. These mineralization ages are obviously younger than the ore-hosted carbonate strata (Sinian to Permian; Han et al., 2007a; Zhou et al., 2013c; Zhang et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2019) and the eruption time of the Emeishan basalt (Late Permian; Lo et al., 2002; Ali et al., 2005; He et al., 2007). The significant time interval could exclude the model of Sedex type proposed by Chen (2002) and He et al. (2006), and the model of Emeishan mantle plume driven proposed by Li et al. (2007). Furthermore, the ore-controlling thrustfold systems of most Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province were resulted by regional compression (Liu and Lin, 1999), completely different from the extensional setting caused by the activity of Emeishan mantle plume. Another genetic model is Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) resulted by the regional migration of basinal brines (Zhou et al., 2001; Hu and Zhou, 2012; Zhang et al., 2015), which is most consistent with geological characteristics of those carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province and widely accepted by geologists. However, the geological characteristics of those carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province have some differences with MVT (Han et al., 2014).\nIn Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, the Paleo-Pacific oceanic crust constantly subducted westward under the South China block in the east, and synchronously, as a result of the closure of Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan Paleo-Tethys ocean, the Indochina block collided with South China block in the west (Fig. 12\n). The intensely tectonic compression developed a large number of thrust fold belts in the South China block (Yang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016, 2020) and formed a lot of metamorphic water. Widely developments of deep faults in fold basin provide migration pathways for ore-forming fluids. Driven by tectonic compression and\/or geothermal gradient, metamorphic fluid circulates along the deep faults in these fold basins and extracted ore-forming elements (e.g., Zn, Pb, Ag and S) from Proterozoic basement rocks, Sinian to Triassic sedimentary wall rocks, and Permian Emeishan flood basalts, gradually evolving to metal-rich fluids. Which can well explain the mixed sources of Pb isotope in Daxiao and other Pb-Zn deposit in SYG metallogenic province. Meanwhile, the secondary thrust faults and interlayered fractures within these thrustfold systems provided the spaces for ore precipitation, forming pipe-like orebodies (Lehong, Tianbaoshan and Qingshan deposits; Zhang et al., 2015) and the stratabound orebodies (e.g., Huize, Maozu and Jinshachang deposits; Zhang et al., 2015), respectively. Evolving to supergene stage, due to the differential evolution of folded basin, the accumulated basinal brine were mixed into ore-forming fluid in the low fields, and the meteoric water were mixed into ore-forming fluid in the high fields, well consistent with the wide HO isotopic compositions of the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province (Kong et al., 2018). Primary sphalerite, galena and pyrite were oxidized as smithsonite, cerussite, anglesite and limonite, respectively. Besides, amount of Carlin-like gold deposits, with mineralization age of 230 \u2013 200\u00a0Ma, simultaneously developed in the thrustfold systems in South China block (Fig. 12; Deng and Wang, 2016), presented by the shuiyindong gold deposit in SYG metallogenic province (Chen et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2019) and the Zhesang gold deposit in Youjiang basin (Pi et al., 2016, Pi et al., 2017).\nIn summary, the Daxiao and most other carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province formed in thrustfold systems caused by the subduction of Paleo-Pacific and the closure of Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan Paleo-Tethys ocean in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. Ore-forming materials mainly extracted from wall rocks (including Proterozoic basement rocks, Sinian to Triassic sedimentary wall rocks and Permian Emeishan flood basalts).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe sphalerite in Daxiao deposit yielded Rb-Sr isotopic age of 223.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma, consistent with most carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in SYG metallogenic province, indicating that these Pb-Zn deposits intensively formed in the thrustfold systems caused by the subduction of Paleo-Pacific and the closure of Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan Paleo-Tethys ocean in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic.\n\n\n(2)\nHO isotopic data suggest that ore-forming fluid mainly originated from metamorphic water, with basinal brine and meteoric water mixed into ore-forming fluid during its evolution.\n\n\n(3)\nOre-forming sulfur was mainly reduced from the sulfates in sedimentary wall rocks by TSR processes, and the sulfur isotopic variation between syn-sedimentary stage and hydrothermal stage was resulted by the closed or open state of the ore-forming system.\n\n\n(4)\nLead isotopic data suggested that the ore-forming metals were jointly contributed by the Proterozoic basement rocks, Sinian to Triassic sedimentary wall rocks and Permian Emeishan flood basalts.\n\n\n\n\n","16":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt (CGB), located in the western portion of the Brasilia Belt, is a part of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Terrain of Goi\u00e1s (APTG), Central Brazil (Fig. 1\n). This terrain comprises orthogneiss complexes and metavolcanosedimentary sequences that host significant orogenic gold deposits (e.g. Crix\u00e1s, Sert\u00e3o, and Pilar deposits \u2013 Jost and Fortes, 2001; Bogossian et al., 2020; Bacha et al., 2021). The CGB hosts the main deposits, where mineralization is controlled by regional-scale shear zones and thrust faults with associated hydrothermal alteration (Thomson and Fyfe, 1990; Jost et al., 2001; Jost et al., 2010).\nOrogenic gold deposits are defined as structurally controlled epigenetic deposits, associated with the percolation of hydrothermal fluids during orogenic processes (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Phillips and Powell, 2010). The percolation of these fluids promotes specifics anomalous and systematic mineralogical and geochemical changes in the host rocks, which the extend and magnitude depend on its deformation state, porosity, permeability, and degree of chemical reactivity (Kishida and Kerrich, 1987; Eilu et al., 2001; Dub\u00e9 and Gosselin, 2007). These changes generates alteration footprints that may assist in determining the exploratory guides for identifying new high-grade targets in mature mineralized terrains (Eilu et al., 2001; Gaillard et al., 2020). Therefore, characterizing mineralogical and geochemical footprints become extremely relevant in the exploration of orogenic deposits (Eilu and Mikucki, 1998; Large et al., 2000).\nThe hydrothermal footprint of mineral deposits is assessed by integrating different analytical tools and techniques. Due to its ability to delineate and characterize the alteration patterns, reflectance spectroscopy has been successfully used in exploration targeting for different types of hydrothermal mineral deposits (Ducart et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2011; Harraden et al., 2013; Duuring et al., 2016; Simpson and Christie, 2019, Tian et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020a; 2020b). This technique allows defining the quantitative and qualitative mineralogical informations, such as relative abundance, chemical composition, and varying crystallinity of some minerals (Van der Meer, 2004), thus helping to delineate and characterize mineralized zones and their hydrothermal alteration halos.\nThe geochemical footprint can be mapped several hundred meters (>200\u00a0m) beyond the economically viable portion of the deposit (Heath and Campbell, 2004). Metamorphic processes taking place in hydrothermal alteration halos associated with orogenic gold deposits are defined by varying degrees of alkali enrichment and pathfinder elements, including As, Hg, Mo, Sb, Se, Te, Ag, and W (Groves et al., 1998; Dub\u00e9 and Gosselin, 2007; Pirajno, 2009). Mineralogical halos replace the metamorphic mineral assemblages with hydrothermal assemblages associated with sulfidation, carbonation, sericitization, and chloritization processes (Christie and Brathwaite, 2003).\nHydrothermal mineralization processes may produce geophysical anomalies in the host rocks that help to delineate and characterize the associated ore deposits. Given that its geophysical signature is directly related to the chemical, mineralogical and textural changes caused by the alteration processes, the study of physical properties of rocks is fundamental for determining the hydrothermal footprints of ore deposits (Chopping and van der Wielen, 2011; Dentith and Mudge, 2014; Dentith et al., 2020).\nIn this work, petrographic, reflectance spectroscopy, geochemistry and petrophysics data were integrated to characterize the hydrothermal footprint of the CGB gold deposit and provide guidelines for gold exploration in the Archean-Paleoproterozoic terrain of Goi\u00e1s. The study was performed in a 1200\u00a0m deep drill hole located in the Corpo IV orebody, one of the several orebodies of the CGB.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Tocantins Province, in central Brazil, is a Neoproterozoic (Brazilian-Pan-African) orogenic system derived from the convergence of three continental blocks: Amazonian, S\u00e3o Francisco \u2013 Congo, and Paranapanema cratons (Fig. 1; de Almeida et al., 1981), and consists of three fold belts: Araguaia Belt in the northern domain, Paraguay Belt in the southwestern domain, and Bras\u00edlia Belt, west of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig. 1a; Pimentel et al., 2000).\nThe Bras\u00edlia Belt is divided into the NE-SW-trending north segment and the NW-SE-trending south segment (Fig. 1a), separated by the Pirineus Syntaxis, which marks the changing structural directions. This belt is divided into External and Internal Zones (Fig. 1a; Ara\u00fajo Filho, 2000). The External Zone consists of metasedimentary rocks (Bambu\u00ed, Parano\u00e1, and Canastra groups), deposited on a passive continental margin structured in a thrust-fold system verging towards the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (Fig. 1a; Pimentel et al., 2004a; Valeriano et al., 2008). In the northern portion of the External Zone, the Paleoproterozoic basement consists of granites, orthogneisses, and sedimentary sequences represented by the Ara\u00ed and Nativity groups (Pimentel et al., 2004; Valeriano et al., 2008).\nThe Internal Zone is subdivided into three main compartments. First, the Goi\u00e1s Massif comprises the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Terrain of Goi\u00e1s (Jost et al., 2013), the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic Serra da Mesa metasedimentary rocks, and three Meso-Neoproterozoic mafic-ultramafic layered complexes (Fig. 1a; Ferreira Filho et al., 1994; Ferreira Filho et al., 1998; Pimentel et al., 2004b). Second, the high-grade An\u00e1polis-Itau\u00e7u metamorphic core and the Urua\u00e7u complex (Piuzana et al., 2003; Della Giustina et al., 2009), both composed of metasedimentary rocks of the Arax\u00e1 Group (Seer et al., 2001) and ophiolitic fragments (Fig. 1a; Strieder and Nilson, 1992). Lastly, the Neoproterozoic Goi\u00e1s Magmatic Arc (Fig. 1a) consists of orthogneisses and metavulcanosedimentary sequences interpreted as a juvenile continental crust generated during the Brasiliano\/Pan-African cycle from 900 to 630\u00a0Ma (Pimentel and Fuck, 1992).\n\n2.1\nThe Archean-Paleoproterozoic Terrain of goias\nThe APTG extends over 18.000\u00a0km2 in the western limit of the Bras\u00edlia Belt (Fig. 1a) and comprises granite-gneiss complexes of mostly TTG (tonalite, trondhjemite, and granodiorite) composition, as well as remnants of greenstone belt terrains (Fig. 1b).\nAbout 80% of the APTG consists of six individual granite-gneiss complexes with distinct structural, lithological, and geochronological frameworks: the Anta, Caiamar, Moqu\u00e9m, and Hidrolina complexes to the north, and the Cai\u00e7ara and Uv\u00e1 complexes to the south (Fig. 1b). Two stages of magmatism were established in the northern complexes (Queiroz et al., 2008). The first stage is recorded in the TTG gneisses of the Caiamar and Anta complexes, with U-Pb zircon crystallization ages between 2845 and 2785\u00a0Ma and \u0190Nd varying from \u22121.0 to\u00a0+2.41 (Queiroz et al., 2008). Magma contamination with older sialic crust was evidenced by inherited zircon crystals with ages between 3.3 and 3.15\u00a0Ga (Queiroz et al., 2008). In the Moqu\u00e9m Complex, the second stage is defined by granodiorite and granite intrusions with U-Pb zircon crystallization ages between 2711 and 2707\u00a0Ma (Queiroz et al., 2008).\nIn the southern APTG, the Cai\u00e7ara Complex consists of tonalitic orthogneisses with a U-Pb zircon crystallization age of 3.14\u00a0Ga (Beghelli Junior, 2012). Jost et al. (2013) defined two groups of orthogneisses in the Uv\u00e1 Complex. The first group consists of polydeformed tonalitic and granodioritic batholiths and a diorite stock. Tonalite U-Pb ages were constrained between 3040 and 2930\u00a0Ma while zircon U-Pb dating of diorite showed the age of 2934\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 (Pimentel et al., 2003; Jost et al., 2013). The second group is defined by smaller, tabular, and isotropic tonalite and monzogranite bodies with U-Pb zircon dating between 2764 and 2846\u00a0Ma (Jost et al., 2013).\nThe supracrustal sequences comprise about 20% of the APTG and are represented by five elongated metavolcanosedimentary sequences confined between the TTG complexes (Danni and Ribeiro, 1978). The Crix\u00e1s, Guarinos, and Pilar de Goi\u00e1s greenstone belts occur to the north (Fig. 1b). The Faina and Serra de Santa Rita greenstone belts occur to the south, juxtaposed by a dextral strike-slip fault (Fig. 1b). The stratigraphic sequences of the five greenstone belts consist of metavolcanic sequences formed by komatiites and metabasalts overlapped by metasedimentary sequences with particular characteristics in each greenstone belt. These rocks underwent polycyclic deformation and greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphism (Jost et al., 2014).\nThe APTG origin and its role in the evolution of the Brasilia Belt have been much debated. Some authors interpret it as an allochthonous Archean-Paleoproterozoic microcontinent amalgamated to the Brasilia Belt during the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano Orogeny (Pimentel et al., 2000; Jost et al., 2013). On the other hand, recent studies suggest that the APTG and the other tectonic domains of the Goi\u00e1s Massif are part of a continuous continental mass of the S\u00e3o Francisco-Congo paleocontinent that was already amalgamated since the late Paleoproterozoic (de Oliveira Cordeiro and de Oliveira, 2017; Borges et al., 2021a).\n\n\n2.2\nThe crix\u00e1s greenstone belt\nThe CGB extends 6\u00a0km wide and is approximately 45\u00a0km long in the northern portion of the APTG. It is bordered by the Caiamar Complex to the east, the Anta Complex to the west, and the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Santa Terezinha Sequence to the north (Fig. 2\na).\n\n2.2.1\nStratigraphy\nThe CGB stratigraphic sequence is defined by a lower ultramafic-mafic metavolcanic sequence, represented mainly by metakomatiites and ultramafic schists, as well as tholeiitic metabasalts and mafic schists (Fig. 2a; Sab\u00f3ia and Teixeira, 1983); and an upper metasedimentary sequence, composed of a thick layer of carbonaceous schists with dolomite lenses that gradually transition to metagraywackes at the top of the sequence, composing a turbiditic succession (Fig. 2a; Jost and De Oliveira, 1991; Jost et al., 1996; Jost et al., 2019).\nIn low-stress zones, the metavolcanic rocks are locally preserved and exhibit primary textures such as olivine cumulates, polyhedral disjunctions, spinifex textures, pillow lavas, amygdalas, and vesicles (Kuyumjian, 1981). Thin layers of banded iron formations, gondite, and metacherts are interspersed with the volcanic rocks (Kuyumjian, 1981). Geochronological studies in metakomatiites and metabasalt samples provide Sm-Nd and Pb-Pb errochrons of ca. 3.0 and 2.8\u00a0Ga (Arndt et al., 1989; Fortes et al., 2003). Recently, Borges et al. (2021b) obtained a Re-Os isochron of 2609\u00a0\u00b1\u00a065\u00a0Ma, interpreted as a metasomatic event related to the emplacement of the youngest Archean granites of the region (ca. 2.7\u00a0Ga) that overprinted the regional Re-Os isotopic signature of the rocks. In summary, current data indicates that the protoliths are of the Archean age.\nIsotopic data of the metasedimentary sequence indicates Archean to Rhyacian ages (Resende et al., 1998; Fortes et al., 2003; Tassinari et al., 2006; Jost et al., 2008; Jost et al., 2014; Jost et al., 2019; Borges et al., 2021a). Detrital zircon U-Pb ages of metagreywacke and carbonaceous schist samples show a dominant source dated ca. 2.2 \u2013 2.1\u00a0Ga, with a minor contribution from sources dated ca. 2.7\u20132.4\u00a0Ga (Jost et al., 2008; Borges et al., 2021a). The youngest zircon crystals provided a maximum deposition age of 2149\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (Borges et al., 2021a). The rocks present relatively homogeneous Sm-Nd model ages (2.5 to 2.34\u00a0Ga) and \u0190Nd (-0.27 to\u00a0+\u00a01.25) (Borges et al., 2021a). Intermediate magmatism associated with the metasedimentary sequence of the CGB was dated 2172\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma (Borges et al., 2021b).\n\n\n2.2.2\nDeformation and metamorphism\nThe CGB deformational evolution comprises four major compressive events (Magalh\u00e3es, 1991; Queiroz, 1995; Queiroz, 2000; Massucato, 2004). The first event generated regional-scale isoclinal folds with axial foliation parallel to the original bedding, under low- to moderate-grade metamorphic conditions (Massucato, 2004). The second event is characterized by an E-W progressive compression that generated shear zones and low-angle thrust faults associated with semi-recumbent folds and was responsible for the inversion of the stratigraphic sequence (Magalh\u00e3es, 1991; Queiroz,1995), and favored the percolation of the hydrothermal fluids, responsible for the gold concentration and deposition in the region (Massucato, 2004). The third event is related to an N-S compression that generated the partial overlapping of the Mara Rosa Arch to the north and generated the Rio Vermelho Antiform (Fig. 2b; Magalh\u00e3es, 1991). The folding caused partial remobilization of gold, which concentrated parallel to the axial axes of the folds and defined the mineralization plunge. Late NNW-SSE compression produced crenulations and smaller folds (Massucato, 2004).\nBecause the CGB rocks underwent greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism, the stratigraphic reconstruction is complex due to the polycyclic deformation, thickening, and the rarity of marker horizons (Jost et al., 2014).\n\n\n2.2.3\nGold mineralization\nThe CGB gold exploration began in the 18th century by the Bandeirantes. In the 70s, the first regional prospective research by the joint venture between the Inco and Kennecott partners discovered the giant Mina III orebody. Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Serra Grande, which currently belongs to AngloGold Ashanti, started the gold production in the late 80s and as the exploratory programs extended over the years, several exploration targets have been continuously discovered in the Crix\u00e1s deposit. According to recent technical reports, the Crix\u00e1s gold deposit has a mineral resource of approximately 3.69 Moz, with an annual production of 114\u2013123 Koz and gold grade up to 8\u00a0g\/t (\nhttps:\/\/www.anglogoldashanti.com\/portfolio\/americas\/serra-grande\n, accessed on March, 23, 2022).\nStudies define an epigenetic model for the Crix\u00e1s gold deposit, which would be generated from a late-metamorphic hydrothermal event associated with shear zones (Thomson, 1987; Fortes, 1996; Portoccarrero, 1996). The mineralization is hosted in metasedimentary and metabasalt rocks, with differing mineralogical assemblages and hydrothermal alteration degrees. It occurs as: (i) massive sulfides, (ii) quartz veins, and (iii) disseminated ore (Jost and de Oliveira, 2001; Jost et al., 2010). The mineralized zones were developed in dilation zones controlled by second-order thrust faults related to stacked major low- to moderate-angle detachment faults and semi-recumbent folds (Thompson, 1987; Jost et al., 2001; Ulrich et al., 2021). The main structures controlling the several orebodies of the Crix\u00e1s gold deposit are Palmeiras Structure, Structure IV, and Structure III. The orebodies exhibit linear shapes with shallow plunge and continuity along the NW to W-WNW trending structures (Ulrich et al., 2021).\nThe Palmeiras Structure controls the gold mineralization in the Palmeiras, Palmeiras Norte, and Baru orebodies. This low-angle shear zone intercepts the hydrothermally-altered mafic metavolcanic next to the contact with a dolomitic layer (Fig. 2c). The mineralization occurs in quartz veins or as disseminated ore associated with pyrite and in fractures in magnetite crystals.\nStructure IV is a low-angle shear zone that intercepts the carbonaceous schists (Fig. 2c) and controls the mineralization in the Corpo IV, Corpo V, Corpo Forquilha, Corpo Pequiz\u00e3o, Corpo Mangaba, and Corpo Sucupira orebodies. The gold mineralization occurs in intense silicification zones and is associated with quartz veins and\/or disseminated as gold-rich arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite.\nStructure III controls the mineralization in the Mina III, Mina Nova, Corpo IX, Inga, and other orebodies, is divided into Upper and Lower Zones and also occurs in the hydrothermally-altered carbonaceous schist of the Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas formation. The Upper Zone (Yamaoka & Ara\u00fajo, 1988) is related to massive sulfides lenses composed mainly of arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. The Lower Zone is a low-angle thrust fault in the carbonaceous schist above the contact between the metagraywacke. Its mineralization is related to arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and minor chalcopyrite disseminated in 0.5 to 5\u00a0m thick quartz veins that reach up to 700\u00a0m deep.\nThe first geochronological studies on the hydrothermal alteration halos applying Rb-Sr, K-Ar, and Ar-Ar methods determined mineralization ages from 750 to 550\u00a0Ma, suggesting that the Crix\u00e1s gold mineralization is Neoproterozoic and related to the Brasiliano Orogeny (Fortes, 1996; Fortes et al.,1997). Later Re-Os dating in arsenopyrite from massive sulfide lenses of the Mine III Upper Zone indicates dates ca. 2126\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0Ma (Marques et al., 2013), and 2137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0Ma (Borges et al., 2021b), suggesting a Paleoproterozoic age for the mineralization and indicating that the previously obtained Neoproterozoic age likely represents the metamorphic overprinting due to the Bras\u00edlia Belt Orogeny (Jost et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\n\n3.1\nSampling\nThis study focuses on the Palmeiras Structure and Structure IV that intercept the metabasalts and carbonaceous schists, respectively (Fig. 3\n). The sampling was performed in drill core samples collected from a 1200\u00a0m deep drill hole located in the Corpo IV orebody (Fig. 3). Fifteen cm-long core samples were collected from the CPIVESD0031 drill hole every 2\u00a0m, with denser sampling (i.e., every 1\u00a0m) in the mineralized zones. A total of 619 samples were used for the petrographical, spectral, geochemical, and petrophysical investigation.\n\n\n3.2\nPetrography and mineral chemistry\nA total of 30 representative thin sections were petrographically analyzed to identify the mineral assemblages as well as the metamorphic and hydrothermal textures recorded on host rocks and mineralized samples. Also, mineral chemistry analyses were performed at the Electronic Microprobe Laboratory of the University of Brasilia to complement the petrographical study. The JEOL JXA-8230 equipment used works between 15 and 20\u00a0kV, 10 to 20nA current, and 1 to 5\u00a0\u00b5m beam diameter. The analyzed minerals include chlorite, amphibole, carbonates, micas, and plagioclases. The analytical results are included in the supplementary data (Appendix C).\n\n\n3.3\nReflectance spectroscopy\nReflectance spectroscopy data were obtained with a FieldSpec-3 HiRes\u00ae spectroradiometer (ASD). The instrument works within a 350\u20132500\u00a0nm spectral range and a 1.4\u00a0nm to 350\u20131050\u00a0nm (VNIR) and 2\u00a0nm to 1000\u20132500\u00a0nm (SWIR) sampling interval, with a spectral resolution of 3\u00a0nm on VNIR and 8\u00a0nm on SWIR. Each saved spectrum represents the average of 50 spectra measured at the same points and in total 5457 spectra were acquired in 607 samples. The spectral signatures were analyzed using The Spectral Geologist (TSG CoreTM) software.\nEach mineral has a specific spectral signature, controlled by its chemical composition and crystal structure, wich is defined by the spectral parameters position, shape, and depth of the absorption features (Van der Meer, 2004). The relative abundance, chemical composition, and degree of crystallinity data are acquired based on the spectral parameters calculations that can be directly correlated with other numeric attributes such as geochemistry. In this study, the relative abundance and chemical composition of each mineral was obtained by the depth and the wavelength position of the deepest absorption feature in the continuum-removed spectrum, respectively. Filters and masks adapted for this work to obtain the spectral indices are presented in Appendix A.\nThe spectral parameter calculations results were plotted in a schematic profile of the drill hole CPIVESD0031 to understand the varying spectral properties of some key minerals concerning the different lithological and alteration patterns along the drill core. The results were validated by the petrographical and mineral chemistry analyses.\n\n\n3.4\nGeochemistry\nWhole-rock geochemical analyses of 619 samples were performed following standard laboratory procedures at the commercial geochemistry ALS Laboratory, in Goi\u00e2nia, Brazil. Major elements are presented as the weight percentage of elemental oxide determined by the ICP \u2013 AES method. Trace elements, including rare earth elements (REE), are presented as a percentage per million (ppm) determined by ICP-MS. C and S dosages were determined by the combustion furnace method. The metals Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Li, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sc, Tl, and Zn were determined by ICP-AES. It is highlighted that the iron analysis corresponds to Fe2O3T. A complete description of the analytical methods and the CCP-PKG01 package is available on the ALS website (\nwww.alsglobal.com\n). The analytical results are included in the supplementary data (Appendix D). Elements present in amounts below the detection limit of the methods are not shown in the tables. Geochemical data were processed using Excel (Microsoft).\nTo characterize the geochemical patterns of mineralized structures, strip logs were constructed with chemical analysis for major and minor elements from the drill core samples. These profiles allowed us to assess the chemical behavior of elements throughout the CPIVESD0031 drill hole. To compare the geochemical signatures of the hydrothermalized halos and host rocks, the ratios between the dosages of chemical elements in the hydrothermalized and non-hydrothermalized samples were calculated for each mineralized zone. Ratios above 1 indicate that the element concentration increased in the alteration halo relative to the unaltered sample, while ratios below 1 indicate depletion.\n\n\n3.5\nPetrophysics\nDensity and magnetic susceptibility were determined to characterize the physical properties signatures of the lithological units and the mineralized structures of the CGB. The results of the density calculations and magnetic susceptibility measurements versus CPIVESD0031 drill hole depth were plotted in scatter plots. Table 1\n and box plots show the statistical analysis results.\nThe density of drill core samples was determined by weighing 607 samples in an IND560 industrial weighing scale. A docked base was used to weigh the samples immersed in water. The density values were calculated based on the Archimedes Principle, which determines that: Ds = (Mss\/Mss-Msi). Dl, where Ds is the density of a solid; Mss is the dry solid mass; Msi, wet solid mass, and DI is the density of the liquid used in the measurements.\nThe magnetic susceptibility was measured using a portable KT-10 susceptibility meter, manufactured by Terra Plus. This equipment works in contact with the sample and provides values in\u00a0\u00d710\u20133 SI units. All values are averages of 3 measurements per sample.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nGold mineralization and hydrothermal alteration\nBased on petrographic analyses, the observed mineralogical and textural variations allowed the determination of alteration halos from unaltered portions of the host rock to the distal, intermediate and proximal portions of each mineralized zone. The adopted lithotype nomenclature was previously defined by Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Serra Grande Ltd and is summarized in Fig. 3.\n\n4.1.1\nPalmeiras structure\nCompositional and textural variations towards the mineralized zone allowed to differentiate the unaltered metabasalt and the hydrothermal alteration halos, defined as distal, intermediate, and proximal halos (Fig. 5\n\na\u2013e).\n\n4.1.1.1\nMetabasalt (Unaltered host rock)\nThe mafic metavolcanic sequence (Rio Vermelho Formation) is characterized by dark green, predominantly fine- to medium-grained massive to slightly foliated metabasalts (Fig. 5a). Locally, primary igneous features like pillow lavas and amygdalas can be observed. The metabasalt metamorphic assemblage consists of hornblende (ca. 30\u201360\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (ca. 10\u201330\u00a0vol%), and carbonate (ca. 3\u201310\u00a0vol%), with subordinate chlorite, actinolite, epidote, and quartz (ca. 1\u20135\u00a0vol%). Ilmenite (ca. 1\u20133\u00a0vol%), titanite, apatite, rutile, and sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite) occur as accessory minerals, corresponding to <1\u00a0vol% of the modal composition.\nThe primary texture is pseudomorphic intergranular. The interstices between the euhedral to subhedral amphibole crystals are filled with recrystallized and very fine-grained anhedral plagioclase and quartz (Fig. 5f and g). Fine-grained secondary carbonates may be present. Metamorphic nematoblastic texture domains are marked by the preferential orientation of amphiboles in one or more directions, associated with granoblastic texture domains consisting of recrystallized quartz, plagioclase, and carbonate. Primary amygdalas and late carbonate or quartz-rich veinlets may occur.\nMineral chemistry data (Appendices B and C) indicate that the plagioclase composition corresponds to oligoclase, whereas amphibole has a transitional composition between Mg-hornblende and tschermakite, predominantly. Actinolite may also be present. The hornblende\u00a0+\u00a0oligoclase mineral assemblage indicates metamorphism under amphibolite facies. The presence of chlorite, actinolite, and epidote indicates retrograde metamorphism under greenschist facies conditions.\n\n\n4.1.1.2\nDistal hydrothermal alteration halo\nThe distal halo of the Palmeiras Structure is represented by foliated greenish-gray schist, defined by alternating amphibole- and lamellar minerals-rich domains, and quartz- and carbonate-rich domains (Fig. 5b). It consists of chlorite (ca. 15\u201330\u00a0vol%), hornblende (ca. 15\u201320\u00a0vol%), quartz (ca. 20\u201330\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (ca. 10\u201315\u00a0vol%), biotite (ca. 10\u201315\u00a0vol%), carbonate (ca. 1015\u00a0vol%), epidote (ca. 2\u20135%), ilmenite (ca. 1%), sulfides (<1\u00a0vol%), and rutile (<1\u00a0vol%). The texture is lepidoblastic, marked by chlorite and biotite orientation. Biotite may be partially or totally replaced by chlorite (Fig. 6\na). Subhedral hornblende, oriented according to one or two directions of tectonic foliation, defines the nematoblastic texture domains. Fine-grained quartz and plagioclase constitute recrystallized granoblastic domains. Fine-grained anhedral carbonate may occur in minor proportions. Ilmenite is characterized as small fine-grained oriented prismatic subhedral crystals. The sulfides are very fine-grained anhedral pyrite and chalcopyrite. Quartz and carbonate-rich veinlets may also occur.\nMineral chemistry data indicate an oligoclase composition for the plagioclase and compositions ranging from Mg-hornblende to tschermakite for the amphibole. Chlorite has significant Fe content and is classified as ripidolites. Carbonates are classified as calcite and Fe-dolomite (Appendices B and C). The metamorphic paragenesis of amphibolite facies is partially preserved, represented by hornblende and oligoclase. Chlorite, biotite, carbonate, and epidote constitute the hydrothermal assemblage of this halo.\n\n\n4.1.1.3\nIntermediate hydrothermal alteration halo\nThe intermediate halo exhibits rocks with similar mineralogical composition but different mineral textures and proportions. In general, this halo has a greenish-gray rock, marked by alternating layers of quartz and carbonate with layers of micaceous minerals and epidote porphyroblasts that are oriented according to the tectonic foliation (Fig. 5c and Fig. 6d). A fine-grained gray rock, with a less developed foliation, is also observed in the transition to the proximal halo (Fig. 5d). This transitional domain consists of micaceous minerals, carbonate, quartz, fine-grained magnetite, and less epidote. Veinlets filled with quartz and carbonate are common.\nThe mineral assemblage consists of chlorite (ca. 30\u201340\u00a0vol%), epidote (ca. 10\u201330\u00a0vol%), carbonate (ca. 15\u201330\u00a0vol%), quartz (ca. 15\u201340\u00a0vol%), biotite (ca. 2\u20138\u00a0vol%), ilmenite (ca. 3\u00a0vol%), and sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite\u00a0<1\u00a0vol%). Allanite and rutile constitute <1\u00a0vol% of the modal composition. Very fine-grained plagioclase (ca. 5\u201315\u00a0vol%) occurs in recrystallized domains and may be saussuritized. Magnetite (<3\u00a0vol%) and muscovite (<15\u00a0vol%) may also be present. Compared to the distal halo, the main difference is the complete absence of Mg-hornblende and decreasing biotite, giving rise to higher concentrations of epidote and carbonate. Muscovite and magnetite appear in the transition to the proximal halo.\nThis halo is also characterized by a strongly foliated rock with a lepidoblastic texture defined by chlorite, muscovite, and biotite. Biotite porphyroblasts up to 4\u00a0mm also occur. Subhedral epidote porphyroblasts up to 1\u00a0cm are observed encompassing inclusions of fine-grained oriented ilmenite and minerals of the rock matrix. The epidote can also occur as fine-grained anhedral crystals, defining granoblastic domains with fine-grained quartz and plagioclase (Fig. 6c and d). Carbonate appears as fine to medium-grained anhedral crystals in smaller proportions.\nA third petrographical pattern of this transitional domain is defined by a fine-grained grayish rock composed of chlorite and carbonate, predominantly. Quartz, plagioclase, epidote, biotite, ilmenite, magnetite, muscovite, and sulfides occur in minor proportions. The orientation of the chlorite lamellae defines the lepidoblastic texture. Medium-grained anhedral carbonate and fine-grained quartz-enriched portions define the granoblastic texture domains (Fig. 6b). Fine-grained rod-shaped ilmenite occurs oriented according to the foliation. Magnetite appears as fine- to medium-grained subhedral crystals. Fine-grained quartz and plagioclase crystals compose the recrystallized matrix.\nCompared with the distal halo, the carbonate composition shows a Fe and Mg increase and Ca decrease, also classified as Fe dolomite and ankerite, while chlorite is classified as ripidolite and exhibits Fe increase and Mg decrease. Plagioclase composition corresponds to oligoclase (Appendices B and C).\n\n\n4.1.1.4\nProximal hydrothermal alteration halo\nThe proximal halo is characterized by grayish fine-grained foliated rock, consisting of magnetite and mm-sized quartz-rich domains intercalated with chlorite- and mica-rich layers (Fig. 5e).\nThe mineral assemblage consists of chlorite (ca. 25\u201335\u00a0vol%), muscovite (ca. 30\u201345\u00a0vol%), quartz (ca. 15\u201320\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (ca. 10\u201312\u00a0vol%), and magnetite (ca. 10\u201315\u00a0vol%), as well as ilmenite (ca. 3\u00a0vol%), epidote (<1\u00a0vol%), tourmaline (<1\u00a0vol%), and sulfides (<1\u00a0vol%), such as pyrite and chalcopyrite. The tectonic foliation is characterized by a spaced, anastomosing schistosity, defined by the preferential orientation of muscovite and chlorite lamellae, among fine-grained recrystallized groundmass of quartz and plagioclase. Quartz is also present as a medium to fine-grained recrystallized crystals in lenses associated with pressure shadows developed around magnetite porphyroblasts (Fig. 6e and f). Ilmenite occurs as rod-shaped crystals oriented according to the foliation. Very fine-grained green tourmaline may be present disseminated in the rock, as well as relics of fine-grained anhedral epidote and carbonate crystals.\nThis halo differs from the others due to white mica and magnetite enrichment, biotite disappearance, and the restricted occurrence of epidote and carbonate. Compared to the distal and intermediate halos, chlorite and carbonate are more enriched in Fe while plagioclase has an oligoclase composition. White mica predominantly has a muscovite composition and paragonite is also present in minor proportion (Appendices B and C).\n\n\n\n4.1.2\nStructure IV\n\n4.1.2.1\nCarbonaceous schist (Unaltered host rock)\nStructure IV intercepts the carbonaceous schist characterized as a dark, foliated and fine-grained rock composed of thin layers of black carbonaceous matter and micaceous minerals, alternated with thin quartz and plagioclase-bearing layers (Fig. 7\na). Disseminated fine-grained sulfide and quartz or carbonate-rich veins are common in this unit.\nCarbonaceous schists consists mainly of quartz (ca. 20\u201340\u00a0vol%), carbonaceous matter (ca. 60\u201350\u00a0vol%), and biotite (ca. 3\u201320\u00a0vol%), as well plagioclase (ca. 3\u201310\u00a0vol%), muscovite (ca. 0\u201310\u00a0vol%), chlorite (ca. 1\u201310\u00a0vol%) and garnet (ca. 1\u20138\u00a0vol%) in smaller proportions. Pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, ilmenite, and zircon are common minerals and constitute <1% of the mineral assemblage. Lepidoblastic texture domains are defined by the orientation of biotite, chlorite, and muscovite dispersed among the carbonaceous matter that commonly exhibits folding and crenulation. Anhedral quartz and plagioclase with oligoclase to andesine compositions (Appendices B and C) constitute fine-grained, recrystallized domains (Fig. 7e and f). Garnet occurs as subhedral crystals ranging from 0.05 to 0.2\u00a0mm or as porphyroblasts up to 0.7\u00a0mm with inclusions of the groundmass minerals.\n\n\n4.1.2.2\nDistal hydrothermal alteration halo\nThe effects of the hydrothermal alteration process on the distal halo are slightly pervasive, resulting in few mineralogical and textural modifications compared to the intermediate and proximal halos. The dark grayish rock is characterized by alternating millimeter carbonaceous matter and micaceous mineral-bearing layers with the quartz-rich layers (Fig. 7b). The tectonic foliation is characterized by a spaced schistosity, with a preferential mica and chlorite orientation.\nThe rock mineral composition consists of quartz (ca. 40\u00a0vol%), biotite (ca. 30\u00a0vol%), chlorite (ca. 20\u201325\u00a0vol%), carbonaceous material (ca. 20\u201325\u00a0vol%), muscovite (ca. 20\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (ca. 5\u00a0vol%), and garnet (ca. 2\u00a0vol%). Ilmenite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite comprise <1\u00a0vol% of the modal composition. The texture is defined by lepidoblastic domains, marked by the orientation of biotite and chlorite lamellae according to the rock foliation, alternated with granoblastic domains defined by fine-grained recrystallized quartz and plagioclase. Anhedral garnet porphyroblasts are common and may exhibit poikiloblastic texture, with inclusions of the matrix minerals. Garnet also occurs as fine to medium-grained crystals. Chlorite occurs oriented, replacing biotite.\nThe distal halo is characterized by a slight increase in chlorite and white mica, and a decrease in carbonaceous material. Mineral chemistry data indicate that the white mica corresponds to muscovite. Plagioclase is classified as oligoclase (Appendices B and C).\n\n\n4.1.2.3\nIntermediate hydrothermal alteration halo\nThe intermediate halo is characterized by a fine-grained grayish rock, composed of carbonaceous matter and micaceous minerals. Sulfide-rich and colorless domains, composed of quartz and carbonate, are also observed. Quartz and carbonate veinlets are common (Fig. 7c).\nThe mineral assemblage consists of quartz (ca. 35\u201345\u00a0vol%), muscovite (ca. 25\u201339\u00a0vol%), carbonate (ca. 12\u201315\u00a0vol%), carbonaceous matter (ca. 10\u201315\u00a0vol%), biotite (ca. 3\u20136\u00a0vol%), and chlorite (ca. 3\u00a0vol%). Allanite, apatite, rutile, tourmaline, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, and ilmenite occur as accessory minerals, comprising <1\u00a0vol% of the modal composition. The rock is characterized by lepidoblastic texture domains with biotite, chlorite, and muscovite lamellae oriented according to the tectonic foliation. Granoblastic domains composed of medium to coarse-grained quartz and carbonate crystals also occur (Fig. 8\na and b). Quartz is present as anhedral crystals, with irregular contacts and undulating extinction. Sulfides occur as fine to medium-grained anhedral crystals, represented by pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite. Chalcopyrite is rare and always associated with pyrrhotite crystals. Very fine-grained tourmaline occurs as clusters of tabular crystals with light greenish pleochroism.\nChlorite compositions correspond to ripidolite and plagioclase is classified as oligoclase. Carbonate is classified as Fe dolomite (Appendices B and C).\nIn this halo, the hydrothermal process is more evident due to quartz, carbonate, and muscovite enrichment, accompanied by decreasing biotite, carbonaceous matter, and chlorite.\n\n\n4.1.2.4\nProximal hydrothermal alteration halo\nThe proximal halo is characterized by a massive light-gray rock composed predominantly of quartz and carbonate, with some domains consisting of relics of lamellar minerals and carbonaceous matter. Sulfide-rich domains are recurrent (Fig. 7d).\nThe proximal halo consists mainly of quartz (ca. 40\u201345\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (ca. 20\u201330\u00a0vol%), carbonate (ca. 15\u201320\u00a0vol%), carbonaceous matter (ca. 5\u201310\u00a0vol%), biotite (ca. 5\u201310\u00a0vol%), muscovite (ca. 3\u20138\u00a0vol%), and tourmaline (ca. 2\u00a0vol%). Chlorite, rutile, allanite, and apatite constitute <1\u00a0vol% of the modal composition. Sulfides are represented by arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite and may constitute\u00a0<5\u00a0vol% of the mineral assemblage. Arsenopyrite is the predominant sulfide phase, and chalcopyrite occurs eventually as very fine-grained crystals. The predominant rock texture is granoblastic, characterized by medium-grained recrystallized aggregates of quartz, carbonate, and plagioclase. Locally, idioblastic and lepidoblastic domains occur with oriented muscovite and biotite lamellae. Biotite may be replaced by chlorite (Fig. 8e).\nMuscovite appears as very thin lamellae. Biotite occurs as fine-grained lamellae dispersed in the rock matrix and as porphyroblasts up to 1.5\u00a0mm. Tourmaline is present as very fine-grained tabular crystals with greenish pleochroism occurring mainly concentrated in irregular domains and surrounding plagioclase and biotite porphyroblasts (Fig. 8c and d). Plagioclase is commonly saussuritized and occurs as fine-grained anhedral crystals or as coarse grains with inclusions (Fig. 8e and f).\nThe mineral assemblage and textures suggest an intense hydrothermal alteration zone where the original mineralogy was completely altered, and the foliation was obliterated.\nMineral chemistry data (Appendices B and C) indicate oligoclase composition for the plagioclase in this halo. Chlorite is classified as ripidolite, similar to the other halos. White mica composition corresponds to muscovite, and carbonate is Fe dolomite.\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nReflectance spectroscopy\nReflectance spectroscopy allowed identifying different mineral groups, such as: chlorite (Mg chlorite, Mg-Fe\/Fe-Mg chlorite, and Fe chlorite), hornblende, carbonate (ankerite, calcite, and dolomite), white mica (muscovite and paragonite), epidote and talc (Fig. 9\n).\n\n4.2.1\nChlorite\nThe chlorite spectrum is characterized by two main SWIR absorption features; one between 2240 and 2270\u00a0nm, related to the Fe-OH bond or Al(Mg, Fe)\u2013OH (Lypaczewski and Rivard, 2018), and another between 2317 and 2365\u00a0nm associated with Mg-OH (Clark et al., 1990; King and Clark, 1989). The positions of both absorption features change according to the chlorite composition, shorter and longer wavelengths indicate Mg-rich and Fe-rich compositions, respectively (McLeod et al., 1987). Mg chlorite exhibits absorption features at approximately 2240\u20132255\u00a0nm and 2319\u20132342\u00a0nm (Yang et al., 2005). Absorption features at 2250\u20132262\u00a0nm and 2342\u20132365\u00a0nm characterize intermediate Mg-Fe chlorites whereas 2257\u20132265\u00a0nm and 2355\u20132365\u00a0nm characterize Fe chlorites (Fig. 9; Yang et al., 2005).\nIn the present study, the drill core samples show that chlorite is the most abundant mineral. The parameter 2340Dcl (Appendix A) uses the depth of the\u00a0\u223c2340\u00a0nm absorption feature to calculate chlorite relative abundance. Chlorite was identified in spectra commonly associated with carbonate (calcite, Fe-dolomite and ankerite) and epidote. In the CPIVEDS0031 drill core samples, chlorite occurs predominantly in the hydrothermalized mafic rock represented by quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schist and chlorite-garnet schist, including in the hydrothermal alteration halos of the Palmeiras Structure, and occasionally in the metabasalt. In the carbonaceous schist unit, chlorite content is lower and related to hydrothermalized zones as well (Fig. 10\n).\nChlorite composition (2340Wvl, Appendix A) was defined by the position of the\u00a0\u223c2340\u00a0nm absorption feature. The results were plotted in a frequency histogram to identify the compositional variation that shows the predominance of Mg-rich and Fe\/Mg-rich chlorite compositions, and less Fe-rich chlorite. The most Fe-enriched chlorite occurs predominantly in the hydrothermal zones of the Palmeiras Structure and Structure IV, whereas Mg-enriched chlorite occurs in unaltered host rock (Fig. 10). This result was confirmed by the mineral chemistry analysis (Appendix C).\n\n\n4.2.2\nHornblende\nHornblende is characterized by Mg-OH-related diagnostic features between 2300 and 2330\u00a0nm, and between 2375 and 2400\u00a0nm (Fig. 9; Hunt, 1977). In this study, the parameter 2320Danf was used to define hornblende relative abundance considering the depth of\u00a0\u223c2320 absorption-feature (Appendix A). Along the drill hole, hornblende is the second most abundant mineral and is predominantly associated with the metabasalt unit, also occurring in some hydrothermalized metabasalt domains, such as quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schists (Fig. 10).\n\n\n4.2.3\nCarbonates\nThe spectral signature of carbonates is characterized by CO3\n2\u2013 related absorption features in, 2300\u20132350\u00a0nm and three other minor features in 1870\u20131886\u00a0nm, 1985\u20132008\u00a0nm and 2135\u20132170\u00a0nm (Gaffey, 1986). The absorption feature at\u00a0\u223c2300\u00a0nm occurs as a function of the carbonate composition and can vary between 2306 and 2330\u00a0nm (dolomite), 2316\u20132340\u00a0nm (ankerite), and 2327\u20132349\u00a0nm (calcite).\nThe carbonate abundance algorithm 2328Dc (Modified from Prado et al., 2016; Appendices A) considered the depth of the absorption feature at\u00a0\u223c2328\u00a0nm. The results indicate that carbonate predominates in the dolomite layers, but it also occurs in zones of hydrothermalized metabasalts and carbonaceous schists.\nThe carbonate composition parameter (2328 Wvl, Appendix A) considers the wavelength position of the\u00a0\u223c2328\u00a0nm absorption feature for distinguishing calcite, dolomite and ankerite. The results indicate the predominance of dolomite in the drill hole samples (Fig. 11\n). Ankerite and Fe-dolomite occur strictly in mineralized structures (Fig. 10). Calcite occurs in quartz-carbonate veinlets hosted in volcanic mafic rocks (Fig. 10). Even though iron carbonates may also be identified by the Fe2+ absorptions features in\u00a0\u223c1060 and\u00a0\u223c1270\u00a0nm (Fig. 9; Hunt and Salisbury, 1971; Gaffey, 1986; Clark et al., 1990; Clark, 1999), in this study these absorptions features were not efficient for calculating the carbonate parameters.\n\n4.2.4 White mica\n\n\n\nThe Al-OH related absorption feature near 2200\u00a0nm is a function of the Al content in the octahedral cation sites and defines the white mica spectrum signature (Vedder and McDonald, 1963; Post and Noble, 1993). Absorptions between 2180 and 2190\u00a0nm correspond to paragonite (Na-rich white mica), while features between 2200 and 2208\u00a0nm characterize Al-rich muscovite (Fig. 11). Al-poor phengite is identified by absorptions between 2216 and 2228\u00a0nm (Post and Nobe, 1993).\nIn this study, the white mica relative abundance was defined by the parameter 2200Dwm, which is calculated by the depth of\u00a0\u223c2200\u00a0nm absorption feature (Appendix A). The results exhibit the presence of white micas in the hydrothermalized mafic rock domains, dolomites, and carbonaceous schist, including the hydrothermal alteration halos of the Palmeiras Structure and Structure IV.\nThe parameter 2200Wvl determines the white mica composition as a function of the absorption feature position observed near the 2200\u00a0nm wavelength. The results were plotted in the histogram (Fig. 11), where it is observed white mica compositions tending to paragonite with absorptions ranging between 2192 and 2200\u00a0nm that occurs strictly in the Palmeiras Structure proximal halo (Fig. 10). Also, muscovite spectra with absorption features between 2200 and 2209\u00a0nm (Fig. 11) are observed and it occurs preferably in the alteration halos of the Palmeiras Structure and Structure IV (Fig. 10).\n\n\n4.2.5\nEpidote\nEpidote was identified in spectra based on the OH absorption features at\u00a0\u223c1550 and\u00a0\u223c1830\u00a0nm (Yang et al., 2005) since its most prominent Fe-OH-related absorptions at\u00a0\u223c2255 and\u00a0\u223c2340\u00a0nm (Liebscher, 2004) overlap the diagnostic features of chlorite and carbonates in mineral mixtures The 1550D relative abundance parameter was defined based on the depth of the\u00a0\u223c1550\u00a0nm feature. The result showed that epidote occurs predominantly in the Palmeiras Structure hydrothermal zone, with some occasional occurrences in the non-hydrothermalized metabasalt (Fig. 10).\n\n4.2.6 Talc\n\n\n\nTalc can be identified by the doublet MgOH- related feature at\u00a0\u223c2288 and\u00a0\u223c2310\u00a0nm, and by the secondary feature at\u00a0\u223c2387\u00a0nm (Fig. 9; Clark et al., 1990). The 2290D algorithm was used to define the relative abundance of talc in drill core samples, based on the analysis of the depth of the absorption feature at\u00a0\u223c2387\u00a0nm (Appendix A). The results indicated that talc occurs strictly in the talc schist at the top of the CPIVESD0031 drill hole and in some samples of quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schist (Fig. 10).\n\n\n\n4.3\nGeochemistry of mineralized zones\n\n4.3.1\nPalmeiras Structure\nThe major element analyses indicate a significant K2O, BaO and LOI increase in the hydrothermalized metabasalt, and even higher in the three alteration halos associated with the Palmeiras Structure (Fig. 12\n). Also, progressive Na2O, Fe2O3, Ti2O, Al2O3, and Cr2O3 enrichment is observed toward the proximal halo (Fig. 12). The distinct behavior of MnO showed increasing concentrations in the distal and intermediate halos, followed by significant depletion in the proximal halo. And CaO, MgO, and P2O exhibited progressive depletion toward the proximal halo (Fig. 12).\nAnalyses of trace elements show that hydrothermal alteration halos have significant enrichment in Ba, Cs, Rb, U, Li, W, and ETR (Fig. 12). Whereas V, Co, Cd, and Zn concentrations increased less along the hydrothermal alteration zone (Fig. 12).\n\n\n4.3.2\nStructure IV\nDespite the chemical differences observed between the hydrothermal alteration halos and the host metasedimentary rocks (Fig. 13\n), the geochemical changes were less pronounced in the hydrothermal alteration halos of Structure IV compared to the Palmeiras Structure.\nThe results on major elements indicate SiO2 and CaO enrichment in all hydrothermal alteration halos. Also, Na2O and P2O increased in distal and proximal halos and decreased the intermediate halo. K2O increased in the intermediate halo, with lower concentrations in the distal and proximal halos (Fig. 13). On the other hand, Fe2O3, MgO, and MnO show progressive depletion towards the proximal halo (Fig. 13). Al2O3 and TiO2 also display a decrease in their concentrations in all the hydrothermal halos (Fig. 13).\nRegarding trace elements, As, Sb, W, Te, and Re exhibit higher concentrations in the hydrothermal alteration halos than the host rock. Mo, Bi, and S, also increase in the proximal halo (Fig. 13).\n\n\n\n4.4\nPhysical properties of rocks\n\nTable 1 presents the statistical analyses (mean, minimum and maximum values) and the measured physical properties, density and magnetic susceptibility, of the lithological components of the rock samples collected in the CPIVESD0031 drill hole.\n\n4.4.1\nDensity\nThe density values vary between 3.880 and 2.130\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1; Fig. 14\n). The ultramafic unit is represented by talc schist with an average density close to 2,884\u00a0g\/cm3 and a small range between 2.812 and 2.956\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 14).\nMetabasalt and amphibole schist average densities are close to 3.009\u00a0g\/cm3 and 3.080\u00a0g\/cm3, respectively, ranging from 2.786 to 3.67\u00a0g\/cm3 for metabasalt and from 2.875 to 3.2\u00a0g\/cm3 for amphibole schist (Table 1). Anomalous values such as densities below the average \u200bdetermined for metabasalt indicate hydrothermalized samples or samples with amygdala and venulations (Fig. 14). The density of hydrothermalized metabasalts, such as quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schist and chlorite-garnet schists, decreases significantly due to the replacement of metamorphic minerals with less dense hydrothermal alteration minerals.\nThe average density of quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schist is 2.876\u00a0g\/cm3, ranging from 2.5 to 3.576\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1). Anomalous values such as higher-than-expected densities correspond to samples from the Palmeiras Structure proximal halo (highlighted in Fig. 14). This density increase is a response to Fe enrichment as indicated by the magnetite abundance in the mineral assemblage as well as the mineral chemistry data of chlorite and carbonate.\nThe average density of chlorite-garnet schist is close to 2.879\/cm3 with a relatively broad range, between 2.428 and 3.727\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1), whereas anomalous density values between 3.33 and 3.47\u00a0g\/cm3 were obtained for the domain below the Palmeiras Structure.\nThe dolomite density values range from 2.130 to 3.733\u00a0g\/cm3, with an average of 2.825\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1). The outliers in Fig. 14 correspond to the dolomite layer below the Palmeiras Structure, which occurs in contact with chlorite-garnet schist.\nThe carbonaceous schist has the lowest average density of 2.781\u00a0g\/cm3, ranging from 2.471 to 3.880\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1). Although hosted in this unit, the density values of the Structure IV samples have no significant changes (Fig. 14). Carbonaceous schist samples with higher densities also occur, indicating high contents of sulfides and garnet, commonly in contact with the quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist levels (Fig. 14).\nOn the other hand, quartz-chlorite-garnet-sericite schist has the highest average density of 3.03\u00a0g\/cm3, ranging from 2.933 to 3.165\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1). Compared to the other rocks, this high density is due to the abundance of minerals such as garnet and amphibole in the mineral assemblage. Quartz-chlorite-sericite schist represents a hydrothermalized metagraywacke level. Metagraywacke has a lower average density of 2.802\u00a0g\/cm3, ranging from 2.658 to 2.980\u00a0g\/cm3 (Table 1).\n\n\n4.4.2\nMagnetic susceptibility\nThe magnetic susceptibility values of the drill core samples ranged from 0.006 to 1424.545\u00d710\u22123 SI (Table 1; Fig. 14). Magnetic susceptibility is lower in metasedimentary compared to the mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic rocks. The lowest average magnetic susceptibility value of 0.120\u00d710\u22123 SI was obtained for dolomite, followed by 0.385\u00d710\u22123 SI for metagraywacke, and 0.421\u00d710\u22123 SI for carbonaceous schist (Table 1).\nTalc shale is the lithological unit with the highest mean MS value of 4.491\u00d710\u22123 SI. However, the highest MS values recorded (up to 1424,545\u00d710\u20133 SI) are related to the presence of magnetite in the hydrothermal alteration halos of the Palmeiras Structure, highlighted in red in Fig. 14. The garnet shale domain in contact with the Palmeiras Structure also has outliers that can reach up to 75,632\u00d710\u20133 SI.\n\n\n\n\n5\nData integration and discussion\n\n5.1\nPalmeiras Structure\nThe Palmeiras Structure is a low-angle thrust fault that occurs parallel and next to the contact with the metasedimentary unit (Fig. 2c) and intercepts the hydrothermal metabasalt, displaying intense hydrothermal alteration (Massucato, 2004; Almeida and Aur\u00edfera, 2006), which is approximately 10\u00a0m wide at 750\u00a0m deep in the CPIVESD0031 drill hole. According to unpublished data by AngloGold Ashanti, the gold grade can be up to 31\u00a0g\/t.\nThe metamorphic paragenesis of the metabasalt, represented by hornblende\u00a0+\u00a0oligoclase, indicates the lower amphibolite facies metamorphic conditions. Hydrated mineral phases, stable at lower temperatures, completely replaced the metamorphic assemblage as a result of the hydrothermal processes. Fig. 4 shows the paragenetic sequences established for each hydrothermal halo of the Palmeiras Structure.\nThe distal halo is dominated by chloritization, biotitization, and incipient carbonation. The mineral assemblage is represented by Fe-Mg chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0biotite\u00a0+\u00a0ankerite\u00a0+\u00a0quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0epidote\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0hornblende\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0ilmenite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0oligoclase (Fig. 4). Hornblende occurs as a relic of the peak metamorphic assemblage.\nThe intermediate hydrothermal alteration is defined by epidotization and carbonation. The resulting halo is characterized by a mineral assemblage of epidote\u00a0+\u00a0ankerite\u00a0+\u00a0Fe-Mg chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0biotite\u00a0+\u00a0quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0ilmenite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0magnetite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0muscovite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0oligoclase (Fig. 4). This halo is defined by the complete absence of hornblende as well as the formation of epidote and carbonate porphyroblasts.\nThe proximal halo is dominated by muscovite-rich alteration and the mineral assemblage consists of muscovite\u00a0+\u00a0Fe-Mg chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0magnetite\u00a0+\u00a0quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0ilmenite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0oligoclase\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0paragonite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0tourmaline. Biotite has been entirely replaced by chlorite whereas ankerite and epidote occur as minor components (Fig. 4).\nThe sulfide phase, composed of pyrite and chalcopyrite, occurs throughout the Palmeiras Structure and its amount does not increase when compared to the unaltered host rock. Therefore, this mineral phase cannot be considered as diagnostic for hydrothermal alteration halos.\nMineral chemistry results indicate that the hydrothermal processes did not modify plagioclase since the same oligoclase composition is observed in both non-altered metabasalt and hydrothermal alteration halos. However, chlorite and carbonate exhibit progressive Fe enrichment towards the proximal zone of the Palmeiras Structure; this Fe enrichment is also observed in the geochemical data (Fig. 15\n).\nThe reflectance spectroscopy was useful to recognizing the Palmeiras Structure since it allowed identifying the chlorite, white mica, and epidote relative abundance, besides assessing their compositional variation (Fig. 15). Although petrographical data indicated carbonate-rich zones in Palmeiras Structure, they were not fully identified by reflectance spectroscopy. The Palmeiras Structure samples are composed of several minerals with FeOH and MgOH related absorptions features (chlorite, biotite, epidote and amphibole) that, in spectral mixtures, can share the wavelength position of the main carbonate absorption features. If the carbonate content is low concerning the chlorite content in a spectral mixture, its diagnostic absorption feature will overlap in\u00a0\u223c2340\u00a0nm, becoming more difficult to calculate the carbonate relative abundance.\nThe geochemical results highlighted a progressive increase in the concentration of alkalis (K2O, Na2O, Rb, Cs, Li, and Ba) towards the mineralized zone (Fig. 15). Such enrichment was identified throughout the hydrothermalized metavolcanic rocks. Previous studies have shown that the increased alkali concentrations in gold mineralizations hosted in mafic rocks constitute much larger geochemical halos than visible hydrothermal alteration halos (Heath and Campbell, 2004). The study on the mobility of these elements can, therefore, be used as a promising tool in gold prospecting since the alkali distribution may indicate the path of fluid percolation (Gaillard et al., 2020). Increased alkali concentrations near the mineralization levels may define an important vector toward gold mineralization exploration (Xu, 1999; Heath and Campbell, 2004; Bacha et al., 2021).\nThe increase of alkalis in the hydrothermalized mafic rocks occurs due to feldspar breakage and loss of potassium and LILEs such as Cs and Rb (Heath and Campbell 2004), which in turn enrich micas, clays, and other secondary minerals as the hydrothermal fluids migrate to more distal portions of the mineralized zones. Cs and Rb commonly replace K in hydrated minerals such as micas, for example, causing the LILEs to fractionate between the hydrothermal fluid and host rock so these elements can be more useful indicators of fluid percolation than K (Melzer and Wunder, 1999). This suggests that the increased alkali in the Palmeiras Structure alteration halos may also be related to feldspar breakage and subsequent incorporation of alkalis in the identified hydrated mineral structures.\nThe chemical behavior of elements also indicates a progressive increase in Al2O3, Fe2O3, Cr2O, and TiO2 concentrations in the intermediate and proximal halos, associated with the progressive stabilization of chlorite, muscovite, and magnetite. The gain of Na2O in the proximal halo can be related to paragonite formation. Less significant U, W, Th, Ta, Hf, Nb, and Zr concentrations were also evidenced in the proximal halo.\nBecause no thermo-barometric studies have been performed on the Palmeiras Structure minerals, the hydrothermal fluid physicochemical conditions cannot be defined. On the other hand, the geochemical and petrographic data indicated the addition of alkalis and iron, as well as CO2 due to the carbonation zones.\nPetrophysical anomalies assist in characterizing ore deposits hosted in greenstone belts. The orebody magnetization depends on the concentration of magnetic minerals in the rock, which can be generated or destroyed by the hydrothermal\/metamorphic processes associated with mineralization. Also, the content, shape, and size of ferromagnetic mineral grains and Fe concentration in the rock affect the magnetic susceptibility directly (Gunn and Dentith, 1997; Airoing and Mertanen, 2008; Airo, 2015; Dentith and Mudge, 2014; Dentith et al., 2020).\nAnomalous values of magnetic susceptibility data were observed, with values ranging from 0.425 to 1425.00\u00d710\u20133 SI (Table 1; Fig. 14) and individual values varying significantly from one sample to another. These significant differences are probably explained by the different content, size, and shape of ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and diamagnetic minerals, as well as higher Fe concentrations.\nIndividual analysis of the alteration halos shows average magnetic susceptibility values \u200b\u200bof 1.187\u00d710\u20133 SI, 10.457\u00d710\u20133 SI, and 305.96\u00d710\u20133 SI for the distal, intermediate, and proximal halos, respectively. Thus, it is observed that the average magnetic susceptibility values increase progressively as the magnetite concentration increases in the direction of the proximal halo of the Palmeiras Structure.\nThe Palmeiras Structure density data also exhibit anomalous average values for the samples from the CPIVESD0031 drill hole (Fig. 15). The average density values of 2.808, 2.967, and 3.068\u00a0g\/cm3 were calculated for distal, intermediate, and proximal halos, respectively. Similar to the magnetic susceptibility values, the average densities increased linearly towards the internal zone of the Palmeiras Structure. A direct correlation between high values of magnetic susceptibility and density with increasing Fe concentration can be observed in the samples, allowing us to conclude that density increase is a direct response to the presence of magnetite.\nIn summary, the hydrothermal footprint of the Palmeiras Structure is composed of a distal halo marked by chloritization, biotitization, and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0carbonation, an intermediate halo defined by the epidotization, carbonation\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chloritization, and a proximal halo marked by sericitization\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chloritization.\nReflectance spectroscopy highlighted the rocks with Fe- enriched chlorite, white mica (muscovite and paragonite), and epidote, suggesting that these minerals can be used as guides towards the orebodies along the Palmeiras Structure. The geochemical signature is characterized by the significant increase in K2O, Rb, Cs, Li, and Ba concentrations, as well as smaller gains in Na2O, Fe2O3, Al2O3, TiO2, LOI, U, W, Th, Ta, and ETR. The physical properties exhibit significant magnetic susceptibility anomalies related to the magnetite present in the proximal halo, accompanied by rock density increase (Fig. 15).\n\nFig. 15 shows the main parameters of the Palmeiras Structure hydrothermal footprint. Note that the exploratory vectors defined for the Palmeiras Structure highlighted another unknown mineralized zone, which is also hosted in the hydrothermalized metabasalts nearly 1060\u00a0m deep with gold grade up to 4.3\u00a0g\/t and stands out for the presence of chlorite and white mica, as well as K2O, Rb, Cs, Li, and Ba enrichment, similar to the Palmeiras Structure. The absence of magnetite explains the lack of anomalous values of density and magnetic susceptibility. Enrichment in the pathfinder elements As, W, Sb, and Re was observed as well (Fig. 16\n).\n\n\n5.2\nStructure IV\nStructure IV is defined as a high-strain deformation zone that intercepts the carbonaceous schists, in which the mineralization is either related to disseminated ore or quartz veins. Previous studies (Petersen, 2003; Sobiesiak, 2011; Souza, 2018) on several orebodies controlled by Structure IV determined that the ore occurs associated with intense silicification zones, accompanied by quartz and sulfide veinlets with arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. Gold occurs associated with sulfides, filling arsenopyrite fractures or free in quartz veins and gangue (Petersen, 2003).\nIn the CPIVESD0031 drill hole, Structure IV occurs parallel and next to the contact between the carbonaceous schist and the dolomite layer, at a depth of 850\u00a0m and approximately 6\u00a0m thick. Unlike the Palmeiras Structure, Structure IV does not exhibit such pronounced hydrothermal alteration halos since carbonaceous schist is less reactive to hydrothermal fluids. Therefore, visible hydrothermal alteration halos are strictly concentrated near the quartz vein and the mineralized zone, where textural and mineralogical variations were identified.\nThe carbonaceous schist is defined by a metamorphic assemblage composed of carbonaceous matter\u00a0+\u00a0quartz\u00a0+\u00a0biotite\u00a0+\u00a0plagioclase (andesine to oligoclase)\u00a0+\u00a0garnet\u00a0+\u00a0ilmenite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0muscovite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrrhotite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chalcopyrite (Fig. 4).\nThe distal halo mineral assemblage is very similar to that of the unaltered host rock, indicating a low-intensity hydrothermal process with a small increase in muscovite and chlorite, and a decrease in the carbonaceous matter, biotite, and plagioclase. The sulfide phase is rare and composed of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Plagioclase composition changes from andesine to oligoclase towards the proximal halo (Fig. 4).\nThe intermediate halo presents more evidence of hydrothermal activity and is characterized by the increase in Fe-dolomite, quartz, and muscovite contents, indicating carbonation, silicification, and sericitization processes. Chlorite, tourmaline, carbonaceous matter, biotite, oligoclase, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, and ilmenite also constitute the mineral assemblage of this halo (Fig. 4). Also, the concentrations of carbonaceous material, oligoclase, and biotite decrease in this halo compared to the distal halo. Tourmaline crystals can be observed locally. The sulfide contents increase, predominantly composed of pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, and low chalcopyrite (Fig. 4). Ca is released in the transformation of andesine to oligoclase and accommodated in the carbonate structure present in this halo.\nThe proximal halo is characterized by foliation obliteration, accompanied by significant mineralogical changes. This halo exhibits increased quartz, oligoclase, and tourmaline concentrations, whereas Fe-dolomite content is less expressive than in the intermediate halo (Fig. 4). Biotite, tourmaline, apatite, allanite, muscovite, rutile, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite also constitute the mineral assemblage of this halo. Close to the ore, there is a significant decrease in carbonaceous matter and ilmenite. In addition, sulfide content increases, marked by arsenopyrite predominance over pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. (Fig. 4). The amount of oligoclase increases in the proximal halo relative to the intermediate halo and is recorded in the geochemical signature by the increase in Na2O contents. The content of carbonaceous material decreases progressively from the distal to the proximal halo, as a result of oxidation when interacting with hydrothermal fluids. The presence of hydrothermal oligoclase suggests hydrothermal alteration temperatures of 440\u00b0 to 480\u00b0 in the wall rocks (Thomson, 1991).\nAlthough carbonaceous schists is a rock with low reflectance, the reflectance spectroscopy was efficient in vectoring Structure IV, since the hydrothermal assemblage of this mineralized zone is composed of minerals with absorption features related to VNIR-SWIR, such as muscovite, chlorite and Fe carbonate. The results prove that this is an effective tool for studying the hydrothermal footprint of Structure IV, as it allows identifying these mineral guides.\nThe study of the chemical element behavior in the carbonaceous schist-hosted mineralization highlighted the SiO2, CaO, Na2O, As, Sb, W, Te, and Re increase throughout the hydrothermal alteration halos (Fig. 17\n). The increase of Ca and Ba can be related to the formation of carbonate and phyllosilicates, such as biotite and muscovite. The increase in As and S concentrations reflects an increase in sulfides formation, especially arsenopyrite.\nCompared to the unaltered host carbonaceous schist, the physical properties of hydrothermally altered samples do not vary significantly (Fig. 17). The average density values \u200b\u200bof 2.77, 2.774, and 2.715\u00a0g\/cm3 were determined for the distal, intermediate, and proximal halos, respectively. These values are \u200b\u200bvery close to the general average density of 2,781\u00a0g\/cm3 obtained for carbonaceous schist from the CGB outside the mineralized zone. The average magnetic susceptibility values \u200b\u200bof 0.262\u00d710\u22123, 0.290\u00d710\u22123, and 0.296\u00d710\u22123 SI, were measured for the distal, intermediate, and proximal halos, respectively, indicating no relevant changes in the rock petrophysical responses. Thus, the hydrothermal processes did not generate significant changes in the physical properties of the hydrothermal zone associated with Structure IV, although chemical and mineral changes have been identified in these zones.\nFinally, Structure IV is characterized by a hydrothermal zone defined by silicification, carbonation, and sericitization, as indicated by the mineralogical and geochemical data. This data highlighted the increased SiO2, CaO, Na2 O, K2O, P, and Ba in the defined hydrothermal alteration halos. Enrichment in the pathfinders, such as As, W, Sb, Te, and Mo was also identified in the hydrothermal zones associated with Structure IV. It is suggested that muscovite, chlorite, and Fe dolomite can be used as mineral guides for identifying Structure IV, as highlighted in the results performed by reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 17).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe integration of multi-source exploratory tools has been increasingly used to characterize the alteration patterns and define the footprints of mineralized zones in hydrothermal systems (Carrino et al., 2015; Naghadehi et al., 2014; Duuring et al., 2016; Simpson and Christie, 2019). The present study characterizes the records of hydrothermal processes associated with the Crix\u00e1s orogenic gold deposit in two mineralized zones, one hosted in a mafic metavolcanic sequence (Palmeiras Structure) and the other hosted in a metasedimentary sequence (Structure IV). The results show that the magnitude of the hydrothermal records is different in each structure, considering that carbonaceous schists are less reactive to the hydrothermal processes than metabasalts.\nThe integration of the petrographical, spectral, geochemical, and petrophysical data allowed us to identify the main changes caused by the hydrothermal mineralizing processes in the rocks and define exploratory guidelines for the CGB, as indicated below:\n\n(1)\nThe Palmeiras Structure footprint is defined by the presence of Fe-enriched chlorite, epidote, muscovite\/paragonite, alkali enrichment, as well as iron and magnetic susceptibility anomalies. A new target potential hosted in the hydrothermalized metabasalt was identified by the spectral and geochemical data. This zone signature is represented by the occurrence of muscovite, chlorite and enrichment in K2O, Ba, Rb, Li Cs and pathfinder elements such as As, W, Sb, Te. There are important vectors for metabasalt-hosted gold deposits (Table 2\n).\n\n\n(2)\nThe Structure IV footprint is defined by the presence of muscovite, Fe dolomite, Fe-enriched chlorite, arsenopyrite, as well as enrichment in Si, Ca, Na, and pathfinder elements such as As, W, Sb, Te, and Mo, that can predict metasedimentary-hosted gold deposits in the studied region (Table 2).\n\n\n\nThis study demonstrates that the integrated application of petrography, reflectance spectroscopy, geochemical, and petrophysical techniques is an efficient way to characterize the hydrothermal footprints of the Crix\u00e1s deposit, and its results define important exploratory vectors for orogenic gold deposits in greenstone belt terranes.\n\n","17":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe value of geochemical anomalies in support of discovery of mineral deposits has been well recognized (e.g., Cheng et al., 1994; Carranza, 2008; Cohen et al., 2010; Grunsky and de Caritat, 2020; Zuo et al., 2021a). The formation of metal enrichment anomalies in the surficial media can involve complex overlap and convolution of various geological and anthropogenic processes (Afzal et al., 2016; Parsa et al., 2016; Yousefi, 2017; Grunsky and de Caritat, 2020; Talebi et al., 2022). These processes can take place at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, with their characteristics and organization being usually different from place to place (Cheng, 2012; Parsa and Carranza, 2021). The resulting geochemical patterns are hence intricate and heterogeneous, which introduces a large amount of uncertainty in identification of geochemical anomalies (e.g., Wang and Zuo, 2018; Wang and Zuo, 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Liu and Carranza, 2022; Sadeghi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020).\nDeveloping novel methods that can effectively identify geochemical anomalies and reduce the associated uncertainty has been the research focus for several decades (e.g., Stanley and Sinclair, 1989; Cheng et al., 1994; Cheng, 2007; Carranza, 2008; Grunsky, 2010; Yousefi et al., 2012; Parsa et al., 2016; Zuo and Wang, 2016; Grunsky and de Caritat, 2020; Zuo et al., 2019, 2021a; Afzal et al., 2022). A wide range of models have been developed, which can be roughly classified into four categories (Zuo et al., 2021a, b): (a) classic statistics, which mainly consist of summary statistics (Rose et al., 1979), probability graph (Sinclair, 1974), exploratory data analysis (Tukey, 1977) and gap statistics (Miesch, 1981); (b) multivariate and spatial statistics, in which the commonly used ones are principal component analysis (Filzmoser et al., 2009; Khorshidi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), factor analysis (Yousefi et al., 2014; Afzal et al., 2016; Parsa et al., 2016; Koohzadi et al., 2021; Shamseddin Meigooni et al., 2021), factorial kriging (Reis et al., 2004), local statistics (e.g., Zuo, 2014); (c) fractal\/multifractal models, which are typically composed of the concentration-area model (C-A) (Cheng et al., 1994), power spectrum density-area model (Cheng et al., 2000), concentration-distance model (Li et al., 2003), concentration-volume model (Afzal et al., 2011), multifractal interpolation (Cheng, 2008; Lima et al., 2003; Yuan et al., 2012; Parsa et al., 2017; Ghezelbash et al., 2019), local singularity analysis (LSA) and its variants (Cheng et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013, 2018; Zuo et al., 2015; Chen and Cheng, 2016; Xiao et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018) and other multifractal models (e.g., Afzal et al., 2013; Shahbazi et al., 2021; Sadeghi, 2021); (d) machine\/deep learning algorithms, which mainly refer to anomaly detection methods, for example, continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (Chen et al., 2014), autoencoder network (AE) (Xiong and Zuo, 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020), one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) (Chen and Wu, 2017; Xiong and Zuo, 2020), Gaussian mixture model (Chen and Wu, 2019) and isolation forest (Chen et al., 2021a), and other deep learning algorithms (e.g., Xiong et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhang and Zuo, 2021), to name just a few. Note that some other methods that cannot be categorized into the classes above have also been playing important roles in exploration geochemistry, such as catchment basin analysis (Bonham-Carter et al., 1987; Carranza, 2008). Among these methods, LSA proved to be useful for enhancing weak geochemical signatures and has been the state-of-the-art technique for identifying geochemical anomalies especially in the covered areas (e.g., Zuo et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2018; Behera and Panigrahi, 2021). Additionally, machine learning models, which can learn the complicated patterns of interest within data based on a data-driven strategy, are receiving more and more attention recently in the field of geochemical data processing (e.g., Zuo et al., 2019; Afzal et al., 2022; Nathwani et al., 2022).\nThe core idea of these methods is basically consistent with the general definition of geochemical anomalies, i.e., a deviation from the geochemical background that is deemed normal. However, the specific principles used to determine such a deviation are distinct for different methods. For example, in the probability graph method, the geochemical background and anomaly are represented by two different normal or lognormal statistical populations (Sinclair, 1974). In contrast, the geochemical background and anomaly are assumed to correspond to two fractals with different scaling properties in the C-A model (Cheng et al., 1994). The anomalous patterns identified using different methods are hence expected to be not the same; moreover, there is usually not a best method that applies in all cases, which constitutes a type of uncertainty in geochemical anomalies identification. Here a best but unknown anomaly detector is assumed to exist that can identify all the potential significant anomalies without taking any non-prospective area as anomalies. We can hence define this type of uncertainty by the difference of anomalies patterns identified by different methods. One way to handle such uncertainty is model selection based on some performance metrics, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the prediction-recall (PR) curve, the prediction-area curve (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015), etc. This is also a common practice in recent studies related to identifying geochemical anomalies (e.g., Chen and Wu, 2017; Chen and Wu, 2019; Xiong and Zuo, 2016; Xiong and Zuo, 2020; Xiong and Zuo, 2022). Another way to account for model uncertainty is model averaging or ensemble (e.g., Claeskens and Hjort, 2008; Diks and Vrugt, 2010; O'rourke et al., 2016). Model averaging tries to combine multiple individual models with an assumption that each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. As a result, a comparable or better performance can be usually obtained, and the ensemble model is often more robust than the individual ones (O'rourke et al., 2016).\nThe family of model averaging methods mainly consist of equal weights averaging, Bates-Granger averaging, information criterion averaging, Bayesian model averaging, Granger-Ramanathan averaging, Mallows model averaging, etc. (Raftery et al., 2005; Diks and Vrugt, 2010). This idea has received attention in mineral prospectivity mapping (e.g., Parsa and Carranza, 2021; Parsa and Pour, 2021), soil sciences (e.g., Caubet et al., 2019; Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi et al., 2022), ecology (Dormann et al., 2018), meteorology (e.g., Massoud et al., 2020), etc., and various case studies have validated the effectiveness of model averaging in predictive tasks. For instance, Chen et al. (2021b) explored an ensemble model that combines the outputs of various k-nearest neighbor anomaly detectors for geochemical anomaly detection. The results indicated that the ensemble model can further improve the predictive capability. To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies yet that performed model averaging on candidate models of different categories for identifying geochemical anomalies.\nThis study aims to combine several state-of-the-art and different anomaly detectors using model averaging, and to evaluate the performance of the ensemble model with respect to the individual ones. A case study of processing stream sediment geochemical samples from northwest Sichuan Province, China is used to illustrate and validate the procedure.\n\n\n2\nMethods\nThe workflow of performing model averaging for identifying geochemical anomalies mainly consists of the following steps (Fig. 1\n): (1) an elemental association related to the targeted mineralization was firstly determined for a given study area, (2) the individual anomaly detectors were applied to identify geochemical anomalies, (3) the anomaly scores resulted from individual models were further combined using model averaging schemes, (4) the performances of the individual and ensemble models were evaluated and compared. The robust principal component analysis (RPCA) (Filzmoser et al., 2009) was used here to determine the elemental association. Note that factor analysis and its variants are also commonly used techniques for this kind of purpose (e.g., Afzal et al., 2016; Koohzadi et al., 2021; Hajnajafi et al., 2021). Three state-of-the-art models were used in this study as the individual anomaly detectors, i.e., OCSVM, LSA and AE. Two strategies on model averaging, i.e., equal weights averaging and Bayesian model averaging, were applied to combine the results from individual anomaly detection models.\n\n2.1\nIndividual models for geochemical anomaly detection\n\n2.1.1\nLocal singularity analysis\n\nCheng (2007) regarded mineralization to be a singular process that involved anomalous ore minerals accumulation and energy release occurring within a relatively narrow spatial-temporal interval. From a multifractal perspective, the end products of a singular process, i.e., the distribution of ore-forming element concentrations here, can be described by a power-law relation:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\nu\n\n,\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n\u221d\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n-\nD\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n-\n\u0394\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u221d\n denotes proportionality, \n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\nu\n\n,\n\u03b5\n\n\n\n is the elemental concentration defined within a spatial domain centered at \n\nu\n\n and with scale \n\u03b5\n, \n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n\n is the singularity index and \nD\n is the Euclidean dimension for the spatial domain (\n\nD\n=\n2\n\n for studying the distribution of elemental concentration in a 2D plane). The singularity index \n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n\n can be used to quantify whether the local geochemical pattern is enriched or not (Cheng, 2007): \n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n<\n2\n\n\ni\n.\ne\n.\n,\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n>\n0\n\n\n\n suggests an enriched pattern, also called \u201cpositive singularity\u201d; \n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n>\n2\n\n\ni\n.\ne\n.\n,\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n<\n0\n\n\n\n indicates a depleted pattern, also termed \u201cnegative singularity\u201d; \n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n=\n2\n\n\ni\n.\ne\n.\n,\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n represents a non-singular local pattern that is independent of the scale \n\u03b5\n. The singularity index \n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\n\n\n\n\n can be estimated by a sliding window-based technique, of which the details can refer to Cheng (2007). A free MATLAB tool \u201cGeoFrac2D\u201d (Wang and Zuo, 2015) was used in this study to estimate the singularity index.\n\n\n2.1.2\nOne-class support vector machine\nThe OCSVM is a variant of the classical SVM and can be used for anomaly detection via an unsupervised way (Sch\u00f6lkopf et al., 2001). The OCSVM algorithm maps the input data into a feature space with higher dimension and iteratively finds a maximal margin hyperplane that can best separate the normal examples from the anomalous ones, i.e., outliers (Fig. 2\na). Assuming \n\nx\n=\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\nd\n\n\n is the training examples set, the hyperplane or linear decision boundary can be defined as:\n\n(2)\n\n\nf\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n=\ns\ni\ng\nn\n\n\n\nw\n\n\u2219\n\u03d5\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n-\nb\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nw\n\n and \nb\n are the to-be-determined weight vector and bias, respectively, and \n\n\u03d5\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n is the map function whose inner product corresponds to the preferred kernel function, i.e., \n\nK\n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\nj\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u3008\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n,\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nj\n\n\n\n\u3009\n\n\n. To find the rule \nf\n with maximal geometric margin, the OCSVM algorithm is reduced to solve an optimization problem formulated as:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\n\nw\n\n,\n\n\u03be\n\n,\nb\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\nw\n\n\nT\n\n+\n\n1\n\nnv\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\u03be\ni\n\n-\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n.\nt\n.\n\n\n\nw\n\n\u2219\n\u03d5\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03be\ni\n\n-\nb\n\u2265\n0\n,\n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\ni\n\n\u2265\n0\n,\n\ni\n=\n\n1\n,\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which \n\nv\n\u2208\n\n\n0\n,\n1\n\n\n\n is a regularization variable indicating the maximum value of the fraction of training examples set to outliers, and \n\n\n\u03be\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03be\n1\n\n,\n\n\u03be\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\n\u03be\nn\n\n\n\n\n denotes a vector of slack variables that allows \n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n to fall on the other side of the optimal hyperplane. Once \n\nw\n\n and \nb\n were solved, the decision boundary function \n\nf\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n can be thereby determined. We can use this classification rule to assign a label to an example \n\nx\n\n: if \n\nf\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n<\n0\n\n we label \n\nx\n\n as an anomaly, otherwise it is labeled normal. More information on the algorithmic details of OCSVM (including kernel trick) can refer to, for example, Sch\u00f6lkopf et al. (2001) and Manevitz and Yousef (2001).\n\n\n2.1.3\nAutoencoder network\nAn autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that can learn a representation (or encoding) for a set of unlabeled data (Hinton and Zemel, 1993; Goodfellow et al., 2016). An autoencoder consists of two parts: an encoder that maps the input into a code, and a decoder that maps the code back to a reconstruction of the input. The representation task was hence framed as a supervised learning issue that aims to minimize the reconstruction error, i.e., the difference between the original input and its reconstruction (Fig. 2b). Again, we assume \n\nx\n=\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\nd\n\n\n is the training example set, the encoder and decoder can be defined as:\nencoder \n\n\u03c6\n:\n\n\n\nR\n\nd\n\n\u2192\n\n\nR\n\nm\n\n\n,\ndecoder \n\n\u03c8\n:\n\n\n\nR\n\nm\n\n\u2192\n\n\nR\n\nd\n\n\n.\nAn autoencoder was trained to minimize the reconstruction error, often referred to as the \u201closs\u201d:\n\n(4)\n\n\nL\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n-\n\u03c8\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this loss function, model parameters of an autoencoder can be trained through the backpropagation scheme, just like other feedforward neural networks. An autoencoder is encouraged to learn to well reproduce the most frequently observed characteristics (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Therefore, it will well reconstruct normal examples, i.e., the geochemical background examples in our case, while perform poorly when facing anomalies that occur with low probability. The reconstruction error, i.e., \nL\n in Eq. (4), can be thus used as an anomaly score to detect geochemical anomalies.\n\n\n\n2.2\nModel averaging approach\n\n2.2.1\nThe general framework for model averaging\nTo formalize the various model averaging approaches, we denote by \n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n=\n\n\n\ny\n1\n\n,\n\ny\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\ny\nn\n\n\n\n\n the observations of a certain quantity of interest, i.e., whether the type of mineralization sought occurred in this study. An ensemble of \nK\n different models \n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\nk\n=\n\n1\n,\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\nK\n\n\n\n that can predict the quantity of interest is further assumed to be available, with the forecasts of each model represented by \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n,\nk\n=\n\n1\n,\n2\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nK\n\n. Model averaging seeks such a strategy \n\ng\n\n\n\u2219\n\n\n\n that can combine these forecasts to well approximate the observations \n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n (Diks and Vrugt, 2010):\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n=\ng\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n, y\n\n\n\u2192\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most widely-used combination strategy is a linear model, in which \ny\n is a weighted sum of the \nK\n model forecasts. Note that the weights of ensemble members are sometimes restricted into a unit simplex.\n\n\n2.2.2\nEqual weights averaging\nEqual weights averaging (EWA) is a simple but effective strategy to combine multiple model forecasts (Vrugt, 2016). This method assumes that each member of the ensemble has an equal weight, which is independent of the calibration data set:\n\n(6)\n\n\ny\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nK\n\n\n1\nK\n\n\n\n\u00d7\ny\n\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, EWA does not require any examples to train the model parameters of \n\ng\n\n\n\u2219\n\n\n\n. This characteristic makes it suitable for combining anomaly detectors for identifying geochemical anomalies when only a few ore deposits are available.\n\n\n2.2.3\nBayesian model averaging\nBayesian model averaging (BMA) offers an alternative to selection of a single best model by weighing each candidate model according to its statistical relevance (Hoeting et al., 1999; Raftery et al., 2005; Fragoso et al., 2018). BMA differs from other model averaging methods in that it predicts a probability density function (PDF) of the quantity of interest by a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual forecasts (Raftery et al., 2005). The weights in BMA are equal to the posterior probabilities of the models reflecting the predictive capability given the calibration data set. Once again, we denote by \ny\n the quantity to be forecast. The law of total probability tells us that:\n\n(7)\n\n\np\n\n\n\ny\n|\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nK\n\np\n\n\n\ny\n|\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n|\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which \n\np\n\n\n\ny\n|\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\n\n represents the forecast PDF derived from the individual model \n\nM\nk\n\n. \n\np\n\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n|\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n is the posterior probability of \n\nM\nk\n\n calibrated by the observations, i.e.,\n\n(8)\n\n\np\n\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n|\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\np\n\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nK\n\np\n\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\np\n\n\n\ny\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\n\n is the marginal likelihood of model \n\nM\nk\n\n, and \n\np\n\n\n\nM\nk\n\n\n\n\n is the prior probability of the best model under model \n\nM\nk\n\n. More details on how to define model priors and calculate the likelihood can be found in Raftery et al. (2005).\nThe R package \u201cBMA\u201d (Raftery et al., 2005) was applied to perform BMA in this study.\n\n\n\n2.3\nModel evaluation and comparison\nA ROC curve is a graphical plot showing the diagnostic capability of a binary classifier as the discrimination threshold is varied (Fawcett, 2006; Hastie et al., 2009). The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds, depicting relative trade-offs between the benefits (TPR) and costs (FPR). A perfect classification corresponds to a point in the upper left corner or coordinate (0, 1) in the ROC space. Points above the diagonal indicate good classification results, while points below the line represent bad results, i.e., worse than random guess. The area under the ROC curve, i.e., AUC, provides an aggregate measure of performance across all the thresholds settings, which ranges from 0 to 1 (Hastie et al., 2009). More details on creating a ROC curve and calculating the AUC value can be found in Hastie et al. (2009).\nEvaluation of model performance using ROC requires a labeled data set. Here the positive examples consist of the known mineral deposits, and the negative examples are simulated by a simple random sampling scheme (Carranza et al., 2008; Nyk\u00e4nen et al., 2015). Additionally, since the construction of BMA requires a calibration data set, the leave-one-out strategy was used in this study, which consists of the following steps: assuming the sample size is \nn\n, (a) the labeled examples were split into a calibration set and an evaluation set, and the calibration set consists of all but one left-out example, (b) the calibration set was used to build a BMA model, (c) the anomaly score predicted by the calibrated BMA model was extracted at the location of the left-out example, (d) repeat this process \nn\n times, and use the predicted scores for \nn\n examples to establish the ROC curve as a performance proxy of the BMA model.\n\n\n\n3\nStudy area and data\n\n3.1\nGeological setting\nA part of northwestern Sichuan Province, China was selected as the study area, with its range extending from 103\u00b04\u20320\u2033E to 104\u00b036\u203230\u2033E in longitude, and from 32\u00b040\u203210\u2033N to 34\u00b00\u20320\u2033N in latitude (Fig. 3\n). This area is located at the junction of the Yangtze plate, North China plate and Songpan-Ganzi terrane (e.g., Zhang, 2012). It is hence characterized by active tectonic-magmatic activities in geological histories, which control the extensive distribution of gold mineralization in this area (Fu et al., 2004). The lithostratigraphic units mainly consist of late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic formations. The Triassic strata, occupying\u00a0\u223c73% of the study area, mainly comprised interbedded tuffaceous sandstones and slates, within which limestone and volcanic rocks can be sporadically found. Isotopic geochemistry and rare earth element geochemistry proved that the Triassic strata provided the ore-forming materials for disseminated gold mineralization occurred in this area (Zheng, 1994; Wang et al., 2004). The Devonian-Permian formations, distributed in the southeastern part with an area proportion\u00a0<\u00a021%, mainly consist of dolomitic limestone. The sporadically outcropped igneous rocks, mainly restricted to the southeast of the study area, are composed of granites, granodiorites, monzogranites, etc. Some study suggested that Yanshanian magmatism is related to the mineralization and there should be buried igneous rocks (e.g., Zhang and Zhang, 2000). The NW-SE trending geological structures, developed predominantly in the northeastern part, impose an evident control on the distribution of gold mineralization (Fig. 3). The NE-SW, and SN-trending structures have been also demonstrated to be associated with the gold mineralization occurred in this area (e.g., Zhang, 2012). The gold deposits discovered till now are mainly sediment-hosted disseminated gold deposits, i.e., Carlin-type gold deposits. Just like gold mineralization in other places around the world (e.g., Heidari et al., 2021), multiple stages exist for the gold mineralization in the study area, including pre-mineralization, mineralization and late-mineralization. These deposits are typically characterized by microscopic and\/or dissolved gold in arsenic rich pyrite and arsenopyrite, and show enrichment in the elements Au, As, Sb, etc. (Zhang, 2012).\n\n\n3.2\nGeochemical data\nThe geochemical dataset used in this study is from the China\u2019s National Geochemical Mapping Project that was initiated in 1979 (Xie et al., 1997). A large proportion of new discoveries of economic mineralization were attributed to this project in that it provided high-quality, standardized and informative geochemical datasets. The dataset used here consists of 3461 composite stream sediment samples collected at a density of\u00a0\u223c4 samples per 1\u00a0km2. A total of 39 major and trace elements\/oxides were determined for each sample. Details on the sample preparation, analytical schemes, detection limits and quality control can be found in Xie et al. (1997) and Wang et al. (2011).\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussions\n\n4.1\nExploratory data analysis and elemental association selection\nThis geochemical dataset has been analyzed in Zuo et al. (2021b). The exploratory statistical graphs of Au showed that its concentrations obey a right-skewed and heavy-tailed frequency distribution, suggesting a great potential for Au mineralization in the study area (c.f. Fig. 4\n in Zuo et al. (2021b)). Zuo et al. (2021b) further identified the elemental association related to Au mineralization by performing RPCA on 15 trace elements, i.e., Ag, As, Au, Cd, Ba, Bi, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, and Zn, with support of the R package \u201crobCompositions\u201d (Templ et al., 2011). Note that RPCA accounted for the compositional nature of geochemical data when performing eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix. The resulting biplot of PC1 against PC2 indicated that PC1, with positive loadings for Au, As, Sb and Cu, may represent the Au mineralization occurred in the study area (Fig. 4). This elemental association accords with the typical observation in the Carlin-type gold mineral deposits. In addition, the frequency distributions of these elements are all significantly right-skewed, while their spatial distribution patterns suggest a clear structural control in the northeastern part (Fig. 5\n). The four elements, i.e., Au\u2013Sb\u2013As\u2013Cu, were hence used to further map multivariate geochemical anomalies.\n\n\n4.2\nIdentification of geochemical anomalies using individual models\nThe four geochemical elements, i.e., Au, Sb, As and Cu, were used as input for the three methods (LSA, AE and OCSVM) for multivariate geochemical anomaly detection in an unsupervised way. For AE, the geochemical samples were firstly split into a training data set, a validation data set and a test data set with a ratio of 8:1:1. The validation data set was used to select an appropriate AE network architecture and monitor whether overfitting occurs. A network architecture of 4\u20136-1\u20136-4 (the numbers represent the unit size of each layer) was finally selected out by which the average reconstructed error on the validation data set was\u00a0\u223c0.0015, and the test data set has also a very low average reconstruction error 4.6\u00d710\u22124. Other hyperparameters including epochs, batch size, learning rate, activation function and optimizer were set to 40, 128, 0.001, Relu and Adam, respectively. The frequency distribution of the resulting anomaly scores is distinctly right-skewed, and most known gold deposits are located in or close to the areas with high anomaly scores (Fig. 6\na). The anomaly patterns derived from AE are clear, mainly distributed in the southern and eastern boundaries of the study area.\nFor LSA, the same procedure as adopted by Cheng (2007) was used here to identify multivariate geochemical anomalies. Firstly, the sliding window-based LSA, with a series of square windows of sizes 3\u00d73, 7\u00d77, \u2026, 31\u00d731\u00a0km2, was performed separately for the selected four elements. The ordinary principal component analysis was subsequently applied to the resulting singularity exponents to obtain multivariate geochemical anomalies. The first principal component, occupying about 60% of the total variance, was chosen as a proxy of the geochemical anomalies (Fig. 6b). The frequency distribution of the resulting anomaly scores is approximately normal, and the spatial patterns are obviously different from the AE-based anomaly scores. In particular, a number of enrichment patterns were enhanced in the western low-background area by the LSA method.\nFor OCSVM, a Gaussian kernel was used to map the input vector into a feature of higher dimensionality, and the kernel scale was set to a constant 0.25. The predefined proportion of outliers in the data was set to 0.05. The frequency distribution of the anomaly scores derived from OCSVM suggests two distinct patterns can be easily identified, and the spatial distribution is relatively diffusive (Fig. 6c), just not as clear as those in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b.\nThere are some similarities among the anomaly patterns obtained from the three individual models. Firstly, all of them show a good spatial correlation with most known mineral deposits. Secondly, the control of faults on the mineralization can be clearly identified especially in the northeastern part of the study area. These observations suggest the effectiveness of the three methods for geochemical anomalies identification. But the spatial distributions of the resulting anomaly scores of AE, LSA and OCSVM also exhibit evident discrepancies. Hence the geochemical anomaly patterns are subject to uncertainty (Fig. 7\na). For example, some local areas in the western part are associated with relatively high uncertainty. The reason lies in that some weak anomalies have been enhanced by LSA and OCSVM, but fail to be identified by the AE network (Fig. 6). These weak anomalies patterns may imply valuable information about mineralization considering the underlying Triassic sedimentary rocks provided ore-forming materials. The area at the southeastern part is also subject to high uncertainty. In contrast to the results of AE and LSA, the anomalies patterns on the resulting map of OCSVM are relatively larger and more continuous, indicating the incapability of OCSVM to reduce the effect of high background arouse from the Precambrian stratigraphic units. The anomalies patterns around several known mineral deposits are also different, as illustrated by the profiles in Fig. 7b. All of the three methods fail to enhance the geochemical anomalies around the #3 deposit. The geochemical anomaly related to the #5 deposit is enhanced by only the method of LSA, while anomalies around the # 11 and #10 deposits can be more easily identified by AE and OCSVM. We can also observe that the fluctuation of anomaly scores from LSA is relatively stationary. In contrast, the higher anomaly scores for both AE and OCSVM mainly distributes on the right side, though the fluctuation of anomaly scores for OCSVM is more evident than AE. These differences are manifestations of the distinct theoretical assumptions of the three methods for separating geochemical anomalies from the background, which make it suitable to apply model averaging to account for such model uncertainty.\n\n\n4.3\nModel averaging and performance evaluation\nThe anomaly scores derived from the three individual models were normalized prior to performing model averaging. An equal weight 1\/3 was used to weigh the normalized anomaly scores and then sum up to get a comprehensive score (Fig. 8\na). For the model of BMA, a negative sample with the same number as the known gold deposits was generated by random sampling. The leave-one-out strategy as described in section 2.3 was subsequently used to build the BMA model. Note that uninformative priors were used for the individual models in Bayesian modeling. The anomaly scores map resulted from BMA was displayed in Fig. 8b. Similar spatial patterns of the anomaly scores can be observed across the study area on Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b, although their frequency distributions are clearly different. The characteristics that anomaly scores show good spatial correlation with known mineral deposits and the evident structural control observed in Fig. 6 have been also preserved by the model averaging schemes. Also, note that model averaging approaches performed poorly as well at the location of #3 deposit where all the individual models failed to enhance the anomalies.\nThe performances of the individual models and the ensemble models were further evaluated by the ROC curve and AUC metric. It can be observed that all the unsupervised anomaly detectors show good performances with respect to the baseline of random guess, as represented by the diagonal dashed line (Fig. 9\n). Among the individual models, LSA achieved the best performance, while OCSVM underperformed in comparison with the other two methods. Nevertheless, the three ROC curves intersect with each other in the ROC space, suggesting that any one of the methods can outperform the other two when the discrimination thresholds are varied. Such observations partially justify the utilization of model averaging methods. The result (Fig. 9b) also shows an improvement in the performances of ensemble models with respect to the individual models. We repeated the above procedure of comparison using different sets of random negative examples, and found that EWA and BMA achieved a comparable performance on average; but in most cases, the performances of EWA and BMA are similar or better than the best individual model.\nGeochemical anomalies associated with Carlin-type gold mineralization were further delineated based on the Bayesian model averaged scores as shown in Fig. 9b. The C-A multifractal model was used to classify the geochemical anomalies (Fig. 10\na). Four straight lines were fitted with their coefficients of determination (R\n2) being greater than 0.85. Three thresholds can be hence determined to delimit four geochemical patterns, i.e., low background, high background, weak anomalies and strong anomalies (Fig. 10a). More information about construction of the multifractal model can be found in, for example, Zuo and Wang (2016). Note that the delineated geochemical anomalies are associated with uncertainty to varying degrees due to model selection (Fig. 10b). For example, some strong anomalies in the western part of the study area are highly uncertain, which require other evidences to validate their existence. Several targets were also preliminarily selected based on the following principles (Fig. 10b): (a) presence of geochemical anomalies, (b) associated with low model uncertainty, (c) near faults and known mineralization, (d) presence of nested strong anomaly and weak anomaly. The selected anomalies patterns might be indicative of the gold mineralization in the study area, and should be paid attention in future studies.\n\n\n4.4\nPotential and limitations of model averaging for geochemical anomaly identification\nThe three anomaly detectors used in this study, i.e., LSA, AE and OCSVM, are clearly different in that they identify geochemical anomalies from the background based on different assumptions. Our results suggest that model averaging approaches can help improve the predictive performance by combining these different anomaly detectors. Therefore, model averaging provides a simple but useful strategy to further improve the robustness and performance of models for geochemical anomaly detection. Note that model averaging is just a commonly-used way to build an ensemble model. A generalized and more flexible framework is meta-learning in the context of machine learning. It combines the predictions from the individual or base models by an independent machine learning algorithm, whether it is supervised or unsupervised (e.g., Vilalta et al., 2009). The base models can be of different types, just like the case presented here, or the same type but with different parameter settings. Hence, there is great potential for applying ensemble models to identify geochemical anomalies.\nNote that the ensemble model does not necessarily outperform the individual models at all time. Firstly, the model averaging approach itself usually involves some parameters that requires to be calibrated. If the sample size of the calibration data set is insufficient, which is often the case in mineral exploration, it may be not easy for model averaging to optimize the parameters and obtain the optimal solution. But the case study presented here suggests that a simple arithmetic mean of the results of individual models has been able to improve the predictive performance, which is thus preferentially recommended for the case with few or no examples. Secondly, there should be differences among the base or individual models used for identifying geochemical anomalies. Since the model averaging framework is data-driven, various geochemical anomaly identification methods can be used as the base models, including but not limited to unsupervised anomaly detectors, multivariate statistical methods, etc. Model averaging carried on individual models that capture different characteristics of the quantity of interest and achieve similar performances tend to perform better than single models. The three individual anomaly detectors used here define geochemical anomalies in different ways, and they achieved comparable performances on average in the current case study. Model averaging methods can thus further improve the predictive performance of geochemical anomalies. Previous studies also suggested that model averaging can achieve performance improvement in cases even when the performances of individual models differ a lot (e.g., Claeskens and Hjort, 2008).\nThe issue of uncertainty in geochemical anomaly identification has been recognized as a major challenge especially where the effects of mineralization are subtle (e.g., Sadeghi et al., 2021). There are various possible sources of uncertainty related to identifying geochemical anomalies of the targeted mineralization, which can be categorized into two types (e.g., B\u00e1rdossy and Fodor, 2004; Carranza et al., 2008; Parsa and Carranza, 2021; Zuo et al., 2021c): (i) systemic uncertainty due to lack of knowledge about geochemical anomalies and (ii) stochastic uncertainty mainly due to the quality and variability of geochemical data. The model averaging framework provides a way to account for the systemic uncertainty associated with various anomaly detectors that define geochemical anomaly under different assumptions. Note that the model parameters for each anomaly detector, such as the size of hidden units in AE, the size and shape of sliding windows in LSA and kernel scale in OCSVM, also affect the anomaly scores obtained by the individual models, and hence the model averaging result. Therefore, the resulting geochemical anomalies are still subject to uncertainty, namely some important anomalies might be missed out while some false anomalies kept. Further reduction of such uncertainties can rely on either explicit quantification of unconsidered uncertainties, such as the observation bias and spatial uncertainty associated with the sampling scheme, etc., or modeling additionally other inherent properties of geochemical patterns. For example, the zonality index, a widely-used technique in recent studies, is expected to be capable of further reducing the uncertainty associated with geochemical anomalies. (Hedari et al., 2021; Aliyari et al.; 2020; Yousefi, 2017; Navidi et al., 2014; Ziaii et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, model averaging approaches were applied to combine the predictions from three anomaly detectors of different categories, and a case study of processing stream sediment geochemical samples was presented to illustrate the procedure. The following conclusions can be drawn thereby:\n\n(1)\ncombining individual anomaly detectors by model averaging can further improve the predictive performance and robustness of models;\n\n\n(2)\nthe geochemical anomalies patterns identified by the model averaging approaches in the study area show good correlations with the known mineralization, and can thus guide future mineral exploration;\n\n\n(3)\nthere is usually not a best model that applies in all cases of geochemical anomaly identification in practice. Model averaging provides an alternative to model selection to account for such uncertainty. It is thus recommended to try out model averaging to combine various anomaly detectors. Only in a minority of cases, model averaging may underperform the best anomaly detector, and then the best anomaly detector is still preferred to be used for delineating geochemical anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nComputer code availability.\nThe R package for implementing BMA can be found here: \nhttps:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/BMA\/index.html\n.

Known Sb deposits in this region can be grouped into two host types, considering mineralization style, host rocks and spatial distribution. The first type is characterized by stibnite as the only ore mineral without a polymetallic contribution, and is mainly hosted in Devonian to Carboniferous sedimentary rocks occurring within the Xiangzhong basin. This type is best represented by the giant Xikuangshan Sb deposit and can thus be termed the Xikuangshan-type (XKS-type). The second type is best exemplified by the Woxi Sb-Au-W deposit (termed the WX-type) and is characterized by Sb-polymetallic mineralization where the ore minerals comprise stibnite, pyrite, native gold, scheelite and arsenopyrite. The WX-type Sb deposits are mainly hosted in Proterozoic low- grade metasedimentary rocks occurring in the Xuefengshan uplift belt (Fig. 1b; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a, 2019a, b; Fu et al., 2020a, b).\nUnlike the XKS-type and WX-type Sb deposits, however, the Banxi Sb deposit, situated within the transitional region from the Xuefengshan uplift belt to the Xiangzhong basin (Fig. 1b), was considered a transitional type between the aforementioned two types because it is hosted in Neoproterozoic low-grade metamorphic clastic rocks but features Sb-only mineralization (Li et al., 2018a; Fu et al., 2019). This deposit has been mined for more than a century with a total proven Sb metal reserve of approximately 100,000 tonnes and a grade of 0.02\u201364.5%Sb (mostly 15.3\u201325.9%; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020). However, the simple ore composition posed a challenge for clearly constraining the origin of the ore-forming fluids and the formation mechanism of this deposit, with some conceptual models favoring either a sedimentary, metamorphic, or magmatic origin based on geological observations and limited traditional isotope data (Li, 1996; Zhu et al., 2002; Wu and Chen, 2004; Tang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018, 2019a,b). A remarkable feature of the Banxi Sb deposit is that stibnite is the only ore mineral and quartz is the predominant gangue mineral (Li et al., 2018, 2019a; Fu et al., 2019). Composition of individual fluid inclusions trapped in quartz by laser ablation\u2013inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) have been widely used to investigate the origin of ore-forming fluids and define the formation process of hydrothermal ore deposits (Heinrich et al., 1999; Aud\u00e9tat, 2019; Large et al., 2016; Shu et al., 2021). The trace element chemistry of cogenetic quartz and stibnite also could provide important and direct evidence for the fluid origin. In addition, He-Ar and S isotopes are useful in tracing the sources of ore-forming materials for hydrothermal ore deposits (Stuart et al., 1995; Burnard et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2004, 2012; Hoefs, 2015; Fu et al., 2020c). Therefore, a combination of individual fluid inclusion analyses, trace element chemistry of cogenetic quartz and stibnite and He-Ar-S isotopes of stibnite on the basis of field geological investigations will help to improve the understanding of the formation mechanism of the Banxi Sb deposit.\nWe conducted an integrated study of in situ quantitative determination of individual quartz-hosted fluid inclusions, trace element composition of major ore and gangue minerals and S isotopes of sulfide minerals, using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in addition to the analysis of He-Ar and S isotopes in hydrothermal sulfide minerals. The primary aim of this study is to characterize the origin of ore-forming fluids and to gain new insights into the formation mechanism of the Banxi Sb deposit.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe South China Block comprises the Yangtze Block to the northwest and the Cathaysian Block to the southeast (Fig. 1a), which were welded together along the Jiangshao suture during the Neoproterozoic period (Zhao et al., 2011; Hu and Zhou, 2012; Yao et al., 2016). The XZMP is located at the eastern part of the Yangtze Block and consists of the Xiangzhong basin and Xuefengshan uplift belt (Fig. 1b). The basement rocks of this region are composed of low-grade metamorphic rocks of Middle to Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic ages, and are mainly distributed in the Xuefengshan uplift belt and sub-uplifts within the Xiangzhong basin. Sedimentary rocks of Late Paleozoic to Mesozoic carbonate and clastic rocks mainly occur within the Xiangzhong basin (Fig. 1b; BGMRHN, 1988). Late Triassic granitic rocks (230\u2013200\u00a0Ma), and, to a lesser extent, Early Devonian granitoids (410\u2013400\u00a0Ma) intruded along the margin of the Xiangzhong basin (Fig. 1b), and were interpreted to have been produced by partial melting of Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks (Wang et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2012a; Fu et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2019). During the Early Palaeozoic, the Caledonian orogeny produced ductile shearing, intense folding and granitic magmatism (Faure et al., 2009; Charvet et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2019). The Xiangzhong basin formed between these uplifts and sedimentation resumed on the Proterozoic metamorphosed clastic rocks, which were unconformably overlain by late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic carbonate and clastic rocks (Shi et al., 1993; Ma et al., 2002). The Indosinian orogeny was probably the most important tectonic event in this region which resulted in the formation of NE-striking structures, the emplacement of granitic plutons and the folding of the strata in the basin (Wang et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2012a, b; Fu et al., 2015; Fig. 1b). During the Jurassic to Cretaceous, the earlier structures were reactivated and reworked and the entire Xuefengshan belt was uplifted further during the Yanshanian orogeny (Li et al., 2013). However, igneous rocks of this period are exceptionally scarce although geophysical data suggest that some concealed granite intrusions may be present at depth (Li, 1996; Rao et al., 1999). There are mainly three episodes of mineralization in this region: the 430\u2013380\u00a0Ma and 230\u2013200\u00a0Ma episodes of Sb-Au-W mineralization in the Xuefengshan uplift belt, the 160\u2013130\u00a0Ma episode of Sb mineralization in the Xiangzhong basin and the granite- related W deposits in the northeast of this basin (Hu et al., 1996; Peng et al., 2003a, b; Wang et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2016, 2017; Li et al., 2018a, b; Fu et al., 2019, 2020b; Xie et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020).\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the Banxi Sb deposit\nThe Banxi Sb deposit is located at the southeastern margin of the Xuefengshan uplift belt, a transitional zone to the Xiangzhong basin (Fig. 1b). The deposit consists of two ore blocks: Jiangjiachong and Xiaogang, from south to north (Fig. 2\na). The major geologic attributes of the Banxi deposit have been documented in previous literature (Luo, 1995; Tang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a, 2019a, b; Fu and Shen, 2020), and details of the most important features are summarized as follows.\nThe strata outcropping in the Banxi Sb deposit mainly consist of the Wuqiangxi Formation of the Banxi Group with a Neoproterozoic age, which contains regional low-grade metamorphic clastic rocks with original characteristics of a littoral facies-neritic facies flysch sedimentary sequence (BGMRHN, 1988). The Wuqiangxi Formation is conventionally further divided into three segments from bottom to top (Luo, 1995; Li et al., 2019a; Fu and Shen, 2020): (i) the first segment consists of grey-green metasedimentary tuff, tuffaceous siltstone, tuffaceous slate, sericite slate and sandy slate, locally interbedded with feldspathic quartz sandstone; (ii) the second segment consists of thick-bedded tuff, tuffaceous sericite slate and sericite slate; and (iii) the third segment comprises grey-black silty slate, purple slate, banded slate, sericite slate and silty sericite slate, which is locally interbedded with tuffaceous slate meta-tuff and meta-sandstone. Antimony mineralization at Banxi is mainly concentrated in the upper portion of the first segment and the bottom of the second segment (Luo, 1995; Fu et al., 2019; Fu and Shen, 2020).\nStructurally, the Banxi deposit is chiefly defined by the NE-trending fault F1 (part of the regional Taojiang-Chengbu fault) and its secondary ENE-trending faults, and a set of EW-trending complex folds including the Jiangjiachong and Xiaogang anticlines which controlled the distribution and occurrence of Sb mineralization (Luo, 1995; Fu and Shen, 2020; Fig. 2a). A set of ENE-trending secondary faults intersecting the main fault F1 and extending along the axis of the Jiangjiachong and Xiaogang anticlines (Fig. 2a) was interpreted to have provided the conduit for ascending ore-forming fluids (Li et al., 2018a). Quartz-porphyry dikes in the northern part of the Banxi deposit (Fig. 2a) are major intrusion rocks with an U-Pb age of \u223c220\u00a0Ma, and are cut by quartz-stibnite veins and thus considered to be earlier than Sb mineralization (Zhao et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2019; Fu and Shen, 2020).\nOrebodies of the Banxi deposit chiefly occur as veins. Six ore veins have been discovered in the Banxi deposit (Fig. 2a, b and Fig. 3\n) which are mainly hosted in the cores of anticlines and are strictly controlled by faults (Fig. 2b; Fu and Shen, 2020). The ore veins can be classified into two groups: (i) NE-trending veins including the V1, V2 and V3 veins in the southern part of the Banxi deposit; and (ii) EW-trending veins, including V4, V11 and V17, which are mainly distributed in the northern part of the Banxi deposit. Among them, the V2 ore belt is the largest and actively being mined. This ore belt occurs as an elongated \u201cS\u201d shape in plane view and has a length of over 2000\u00a0m along strike (Li et al., 2018a). It contains three separate veins from NE to SW (Fig. 2a), with thickness ranging from 0.3 to 2.1\u00a0m and a variable grade of 0.03% to 61.0% Sb. The mineral assemblage of the ores is relatively simple: stibnite is the principal ore mineral, with minor arsenopyrite; the gangue consists mainly of quartz, chlorite and sericite (Fig. 4\n). Three major stages were differentiated based on the cross-cutting relationship of ore veins and generation sequence of gangue- and ore-minerals, that is, the quartz, quartz-stibnite and stibnite stages (Li et al., 2018a), of which the quartz-stibnite stage has the majority of Sb reserves (Fu and Shen, 2020).\nFluid inclusion studies have suggested that the homogenization temperature of ore-forming fluids in the Banxi deposit ranges from 260 to 170\u00a0\u00b0C with the salinities of 3.4\u20137.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. (Li et al., 2019a). The host rocks of Sb mineralization were intensively altered by ore-forming hydrothermal fluids (Fu and Shen, 2020; Li et al., 2020), which caused sericitization and silicification close to ore veins and chloritization further away from the ore veins (Li et al., 2020 and Fig. 5\n therein).\nMultiple methods have been employed to determine the precise age of Sb mineralization at Banxi. Peng et al. (2003a) proposed that Sb mineralization at Banxi may have taken place during Early Palaeozoic (397\u2013422\u00a0Ma) by using quartz Ar-Ar dating. However, as stated above, the cross-cutting relationship between quartz- porphyry dykes and stibnite-quartz veins suggests that Sb mineralization at Banxi should occur later than 220\u00a0Ma. Most recently, the Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd dating results of hydrothermal sulfides and zircon (U-Th)\/He dates reported by Li et al. (2018a, 2020) and Fu et al. (2019) have suggested the Banxi Sb deposit formed at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0130\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n\n3\nSamples and analytical methods\nBecause most ore veins of this deposit have been mined out or are not mining, all samples in this study were mainly collected from underground exposures of the V2 ore belt in the Banxi deposit. One sample (BX-6-1), composed of coarse-grained stibnite and quartz veins, was taken from the sublevel #06 at an elevation of \u221260\u00a0m; one sample (BX-8-4) was taken from the sublevel #08 at an elevation of \u2212120\u00a0m, which is composed of altered slate and fine-grained stibnite; two samples were taken from the sublevel #14 at an elevation of \u2212375\u00a0m, of which the BX-14-2 is composed of fine-grained stibnite and quartz veins, and the BX-14-3 mainly consists of mainly coarse-grained stibnite; three samples were taken from the sublevel #15 at an elevation of \u2212415\u00a0m, where the BX-15-1 is composed of quartz-stibnite veins, the BX-15-3 of pure stibnite, and the BX-15-3 of altered slate and fine-grained arsenopyrite; two samples were taken from the sublevel #19 at an elevation of \u2212595\u00a0m, whereas the BX-19-1 is composed of coarse-grained stibnite and quartz veins, and the BX-19-2 comprises altered slate and coarse-grained arsenopyrite.\n\n3.1\nLA-ICP-MS analyses of individual fluid inclusions\nIndividual fluid inclusions trapped in quartz from the quartz-stibnite stage in the Banxi Sb deposit were analysed using an Agilent 7900 Quadrupole ICP-MS coupled with a NWR-193 UC laser ablation system at the Magmatic and Ore-Forming Processes Research Laboratory at the University of Toronto. An in-house trachytic glass standard doped with a broad range of trace elements was used for external standardization. The carrier gas (He) flow of 1\u00a0l\/min was used and the instrument was tuned to ThO\/Th\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.3%, Mass 21\/42Ca\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.3%, and 238U\/232Th of 1.0\u20131.1 using the NIST 610 glass. The laser beam diameter was adjusted for each analysis to ensure complete ablation of the fluid inclusion while minimising the blasting of the host quartz; thus, the spot diameter varied between 12 and 20\u00a0\u03bcm depending on the size of the fluid inclusions. Each analysis block consists of 12\u201315 fluid inclusion analyses bracketed by 2\u20132 external standard analyses at the beginning and the end. More details of the analytical method can be found in Yin and Zajacz (2018). A range of trace elements including B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Sn, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, and Pb concentrations were measured in each fluid inclusion. Quantification of individual inclusion LA-ICP-MS signals involves the integration of each element, background subtraction, subtraction of host quartz contributions to the signal, and comparison of signal intensities with an external silicate glass standard (NIST 610). The ICP-MS yields only ratios, thus absolute elemental concentrations are derived by comparison of elemental ratios to independently derived estimates of wt. % NaCl equiv. from microthermometry. Trace element concentrations were corrected for the mass contribution of other major elements within the fluid inclusion (Halter et al., 2002; Heinrich et al., 2003). The raw LA-ICP -MS data were reduced using the SILLS program (Guillong et al., 2008), which has the capability to integrate multiple areas of the signal portions and gives concentrations of elements in both fluid inclusions and host quartz. The contribution of the host quartz to the mixed fluid-glass signals was removed assuming that all Si signals were from the quartz.\n\n\n3.2\nLA-ICP-MS trace element analyses\nQuantitative determination of the trace element composition for stibnite from the quartz-stibnite and stibnite stages was conducted using an Agilent 7700x quadrupole ICP-MS coupled with a New Wave UP213 laser ablation system at the Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGCAS). Laser ablation was conducted in a pure He atmosphere using an in-house small-volume sample cell and the aerosol was mixed with Ar as a transport gas immediately after leaving the cell. The measurement of spots was performed at laser pulse frequency of 10\u00a0Hz and spot size of 40\u00a0\u03bcm with laser energy of 3.5\u00a0J\/cm2. The analysis time for each spot was 120\u00a0s, comprising a 30-s measurement of the background with the laser off, and 60-s analysis with the laser on, and followed by a 30-s retention time to ensure proper cell washout. A linear drift correction based on the analysis sequence and on the bracketing analyses of MASS-1 was applied to the count rate for each sample. The dwell time was set to 10\u00a0ms for each element measured with a total sweep time of <0.5\u00a0s. External calibration was performed against the in-house standards (GSE-1G and GSD-1G), and sulfide reference material MASS-1 (formerly known as PSD-1; Wilson et al., 2002) was used as a secondary check (running as an \u201cunknown\u201d) to monitor the analytical accuracy. The following isotopes were measured to avoid isobaric and polyatomic interferences: 7Li, 27Al, 29Si, 34S, 51V, 53Cr, 55Mn, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 65Cu, 66Zn, 71Ga, 72Ge, 75As, 77Se, 85Rb, 88Sr, 95Mo, 105Pd, 107Ag, 111Cd, 115In, 118Sn, 125Te, 197Au, 201Hg, 205Tl, 208Pb, 209Bi and 238U. The raw analytical data in each spot are plotted as a time-resolved depth spectrum and the integration time for background and sample signal selected. The counts are then corrected for instrument drift and converted to concentration values using the Sb values as an internal standard. Synthetic standard glasses (NIST SRM 610 and 612) were additionally measured to recognize a possible instrumental drift. More details of the analytical processes and reduction of raw data could be found in Fu et al. (2020a).\nThe trace element composition of quartz from the quartz-stibnite stage was analyzed using an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS equipped with a GeoLasPro 193\u00a0nm ArF excimer laser at IGCAS, with conditions of a laser repetition of 10\u00a0Hz, energy density of 12\u00a0J\/cm2 and spot size of 44\u00a0\u03bcm. NIST SRM610 and GSD-1G were employed as external standard for quantitative calibrations, which was measured before and after each set of spots on a given sample. The analysis time for each spot was set at 90\u00a0s, comprising a 30-s measurement of the background with the laser off and a 60-s analysis with the laser on. An internal standard-independent calibration strategy was applied to the calibrations (Liu et al., 2008), which is based on the normalization of the sum of all metal oxides to 100\u00a0wt%. NIST SRM612 and GSD-1G were analyzed to monitor the accuracy of the results, which show that the uncertainties of most elements (e.g. Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Sb, Ge, Rb and Sr) are <6% with detection limits ranging from few ppm to ppb. More details of the analytical procedures can be found in Lan et al. (2018).\n\n\n3.3\nHe-Ar isotope analyses\nHe-Ar isotope analyses of stibnite and arsenopyrite were completed at IGCAS using an all-metal extraction line and a mass spectrometer (GV5400). The analytical methods are similar to those of Stuart et al. (1995), Hu et al. (2012) and Kendrick and Burnard (2013). However, more stibnite grains are required to extract sufficient He and Ar because of the low He-Ar abundance entrapped in stibnite. Approximately 1\u20135\u00a0g of separated coarse stibnite grains (generally 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0mm but the coarser the better) were ultrasonically cleaned in alcohol, dried, then loaded in on-line in vacuum crusher buckets. The samples were baked at 150\u00a0\u00b0C on-lined with the ultra-high vacuum system for >24\u00a0h prior to analysis in order to remove adhered atmospheric gases. Gases were released from the grains into the all-metal extraction system by sequential crushing in modified Nupro-type valves. The released gases were exposed to a titanium sponge furnace at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min to remove the bulk of active gases (e.g\u00b7H2O and CO2), and then exposed to two SAES Zr-Al getters (one at room temperature, the other at 450\u00a0\u00b0C) for 10\u00a0min for further purification. He was separated from Ar using an activated charcoal cold finger at liquid N2 temperature (\u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C) for 40\u201360\u00a0min to trap Ar. He and Ar isotopes and abundances were analyzed using GV5400. Gas abundances were measured by peak-height comparison with known amounts of standard air from an air bottle. He and Ar abundances and isotopic ratios were calibrated against pipettes of 0.1\u00a0cm3 STP air (5.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 cm3 STP 4He and 9.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 cm3 STP 40Ar). Procedural blanks were <2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 cm3 STP 4He and (2\u20134)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 cm3 STP 40Ar, and constituted <1% of analyses. The blank was too low to affect the calibration of the abundance measurement.\n\n\n3.4\nLA-ICP-MS S isotope analyses\nThe in situ analysis of S isotopic compositions of stibnites and arsenopyrite in ores was conducted by LA-MC-ICP-MS at the State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Northwest University, China. The laser ablation system (RESOlution M-50), consisting of an excimer laser (193\u00a0nm), a two-volume laser ablation cell (Laurin Technic S155), a Squid smoothing device, and a computer-controlled high- precision X-Y stage, was linked to MC-ICP-MS (Nu Plasma 1700) for in situ analysis of S isotope. The Nu 1700 MC-ICP-MS system equipped with sixteen Faraday cups and three ion counters was used to determine the sulfur isotopic composition of the PSPTs. The cup configurations for sulfur were as follows: an H5 cup for 34S, an Ax cup for 33S, and an L4 cup for 32S. Helium was used as the carrier gas for the laser ablation process, and it entered the cell body at its bottom to fill the cell. Helium from both the bottom and top through the funnel cell entrained the sample aerosol and argon was admixed downstream, in front of the squid signal smoothing device, into the MC-ICP-MS. Instrumental bias was corrected using the SSB approach with repeated measurements of the standard reference (IAEA-S-1, Ag2S), before and after each sample. For monitoring the accuracy of data during analysis, the in-house standard Cpy-1\/GC (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u2030) was analyzed every 8 spots. More details on the method are provided by Chen et al. (2017) and Yuan et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nChemical composition of individual fluid inclusions\nMicroanalyses using LA-ICP-MS were performed on 124 individual inclusions. Relatively large inclusions (>10\u00a0\u03bcm; Fig. 5) were targeted because of the lower detection limits due to larger amounts of liquid. Because vapor-rich and vapor-only inclusions contained insignificant amounts of liquid phase, no apparent transient signal could be identified. Accordingly, in this case we report only values from liquid-rich inclusions, and the Electronic Supplementary Table S1 details the composition of individual fluid inclusions. These inclusions contain elevated concentrations of Na (2,943\u201319,489\u00a0ppm), Ca (2, 431\u201314,237\u00a0ppm), K (956\u20138,274\u00a0ppm), Al (137\u201324,782\u00a0ppm), Fe (324\u201312,349\u00a0ppm), and Sb (>23\u20137,957\u00a0ppm) and commonly contain measurable concentrations of B, As, Mg, Zn, Mn, Ti, Cu, Ba, Sr, Ag, Cs, W and Rb (typically\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0ppm; Fig. 6\na). Other elements (e.g., Au, Sb, Bi and Mo) are typically at or less than detectable quantities.\n\n\n4.2\nTrace element composition of stibnite and quartz\nForty-one spot analyses are conducted on five hydrothermal quartz samples collected from different sublevels. Trace elements with elevated concentrations routinely above the limits of detection are summarized in Fig. 6b and the full dataset of trace element composition of investigated quartz is presented in the Electronic Supplementary Table S2. Aluminum, Sb, Li, Na, K, Ge, B, Mg, Sc, Ti, and As are the most common trace elements, with concentrations of typically\u00a0>\u00a01\u201310\u00a0ppm (Fig. 6b); concentrations of other elements (V, Fe, Mn, Co, Ga, Cu, Zn, Rb, Ag, Pb, Se, Te, In, Cd, Sn, Au, and Bi) are typically at or below the limit of detection (generally lower than 1\u00a0ppm). Notably, the concentrations of major measured trace elements in quartz from the Banxi Sb deposit are relatively lower than those in the XKS-type and WX-type Sb deposits. For example, the Al and Sb concentrations in quartz are generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those from the Xikuangshan Sb deposits (generally\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0ppm; Fu et al., 2020c).\nLikewisely, sixty spot analyses of trace elements were acquired on ten stibnite samples. Because many elements were detected at extremely low concentrations or below detection limits, elements with elevated concentrations well above the detection limits are included in Fig. 6c and the full dataset trace element composition of the investigated stibnite samples are given in the Electronic Supplementary Table S3. Because only a few elements can be incorporated into stibnite, Cu, Pb, As and Fe are the most abundant trace elements which may be present in the form of nanoparticles or micro-inclusions in stibnite, with concentrations of typically\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0ppm (Fig. 6c). Despite our efforts to avoid visible inclusions, some analyses showed anomalous concentrations which might be a result of the presence of mineral or fluid inclusions. For example, the high variability of the As concentration (Fig. 6c) probably indicates the presence of As-rich inclusions in stibnite.\n\n\n4.3\nHe-Ar isotopes of stibnite and arsenopyrite\nThe abundances and isotopic compositions of He and Ar in fluids trapped in stibnite and arsenopyrite from the Banxi Sb deposit are illustrated in Table 1\n and Fig. 7\n. The concentrations of 4He and 40Ar range from 3.81\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 to 49.13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 cm3 STP\/g and 0.43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 to 19.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 cm3 STP\/g, respectively. The 40Ar\/36Ar ratios vary from 323 to 1111, with an average value of 737, which is much higher than the atmospheric value of 296.2 (Mark et al., 2011). The 3He\/4He ratios for stibnite and arsenopyrite were extremely low varying from 0.001 to 0.048 Ra. Notably, the 3He\/4He ratios for stibnite are slightly higher than those for arsenopyrite (Table 1).\n\n\n4.4\nSulfur isotopic composition of stibnite and arsenopyrite\nTwenty-three LA-ICP-MS sulfur isotope analyses are conducted on eighteen stibnite grains and five arsenopyrite grains, and the results are shown in Table 2\n and Fig. 8\n. The stibnite and arsenopyrite grains from the Banxi Sb deposit possess relatively positive and homogeneous sulfur isotopic compositions. The \u03b434S values of stibnite grains range from +8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u2030 to +9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32\u2030 with an average of +8.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u2030; the \u03b434S values of arsenopyrite grains vary from +7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28\u2030 to +8.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u2030 with an average of 8.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u2030.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nOrigin of ore-forming fluids\nThe origin of the hydrothermal fluids from which the Banxi deposit formed has long been a matter of debate and previous studies have suggested that the fluids were of sedimentary, metamorphic, or magmatic origin based on traditional fluid-inclusion and equivocal stable isotope data (Li, 1996; Zhu et al., 2002; Wu and Chen, 2004; Li et al., 2018, 2019a, b). Notably, because the latest metamorphic event documented in the studied region (460\u2013400\u00a0Ma; Faure et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Wan et al., 2010) occurred approximately 300 million years ago before the timing of Sb mineralization (\u223c130\u00a0Ma; Li et al., 2018a; Fu et al., 2019) at Banxi. Many studies have demonstrated that low-grade metamorphism (e.g., subgreenschist face) cannot cause significant mobility of Sb from sedimentary protoliths (Pitcairn et al., 2006, 2015; Phillips and Powell, 2010; Garofalo, 2012). Therefore, the typical metamorphic fluids are unlikely to be primary components of the fluids for forming the Banxi Sb deposit. Contrastingly, our new data favor the dominance of basinal brines in the ore-forming fluids of the Banxi Sb deposit with the addition of meteoric water.\nMultiple criteria based on element concentrations and ratios measured by LA- ICP-MS analysis can be used to trace fluid sources. For example, the Na+\/K+ ratio (molar ratio) of a series of fluid inclusions is generally used to discriminate fluid sources (Lu et al., 2004; Rusk et al., 2004; Simpson et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2019). Magmatic-derived hydrothermal fluids have a Na+\/K+ ratio of <1, fluids derived from a sedimentary source (e.g. basin brines) at depth have a higher Na+\/K+ ratio (e.g., \u223c17 for MVT Pb-Zn deposits; Lu et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2020). The Na+\/K+ ratios of most fluid inclusions from the Banxi deposit range from 3 to 20, which are higher than those of magmatic but are comparable to the values for basinal brines in sedimentary rocks. Moreover, the source of fluids can be inferred from their trace element compositions (Large et al., 2016). In general, hydrothermal fluids derived from a magmatic source are generally enriched in alkali metals (Li, K, Rb, and Cs), whereas basinal brines tend to be enriched in alkaline earth elements (Ca, Sr, and Mg) (Samson et al., 2008; Williams-Jones et al., 2010; Kharaka and Hanor, 2014; Shu et al., 2021). The fluid inclusion data obtained in this study are plotted in the Rb\/Na vs K\/Na and Mn vs Na diagrams (Fig. 9\na, b), most of which fall outside the characteristic areas of magmatic- hydrothermal fluids but are close to those of basinal brines acquired from Samson et al. (2008) and Williams-Jones et al. (2010). The elevated B contents (typically\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0ppm) and low Mn\/Na and Sr\/Na ratios of most fluid inclusions in fluid inclusions also support the dominance of basinal brines in ore-forming fluids (Fig. 9b\u2013d; Kharaka and Hanor, 2014). Additionally, the Cs\/Rb ratios are generally applied to identify the diversity of fluid sources because Cs and Rb are considered to be largely conservative fluid components during hydrothermal processes (Klemm et al., 2008; Korges et al., 2018). The measured Cs\/Rb ratios for the fluids in the Banxi range within a limited range (0.22\u20133.69), indicating that the fluids of different stages evolved from a similar fluid source without significant dilution by an external fluid source during quartz precipitation. A positive correlation was identified between the Cs and Rb contents in fluid inclusions, further indicating that ore-forming fluids for different stages in this deposit share a common source. It is thus reasonable to suppose that ore-forming fluids of the Banxi Sb deposit are probably dominated by basinal brines, which would be further supported by following He-Ar isotopic data.\nSulfide minerals, including stibnite and aresenopyrite, have been proven a faithful trap of noble gases in parental fluids (Stuart et al., 1994; Baptiste and Fouquet, 1996; Burnard et al., 1999; Hu et al., 1999). He-Ar isotopes in hydrothermal sulfides have been widely used for tracing the source of ore-forming fluids because a factor of \u223c1000 times difference between 3He\/4He ratios of the upper mantle (6\u20139Ra, where Ra is the atmospheric 3He\/4He ratio, 1.39\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126) and He produced in the crust (<0.05 Ra) allows He isotopes to provide an unique insight into processes where mantle volatiles have been added to crustal fluids (Stuart et al., 1995; Burnard et al., 1999; Burnard and Polya, 2004; Hu et al., 2004, 2009, 2012; Wu et al., 2018). Helium and Ar in fluid inclusions trapped in hydrothermal minerals are generally derived from the air- saturated water (ASW), mantle-derived volatiles and radiogenic decay of U, Th and K in crustal rocks with distinct He-Ar isotope ratios (Stuart et al., 1995; Burnard et al., 1999). The stibnite and arsenopyrite separates, recovered from underground samples at Banxi, are euhedral crystals with no evidence of post-crystallization modification; therefore, the measured He and Ar isotopes of the volatiles extracted from the stibnite and aresenopyrite separates at the Banxi Sb deposit can be used to represent the initial isotope compositions of the ore-forming fluids.\nThe 3He\/4He ratios in fluid inclusions determined in this study range from 0.001 to 0.048 Ra and are much lower than the upper mantle value of 6\u20139 Ra but are close to the value for the fluids with a crustal origin (typically\u00a0<\u00a00.1 Ra, ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 Ra; Stuart et al., 1995; Fig. 7a), indicating a crustal origin of He in the fluids at Banxi. The 3He\/36Ar ratios of 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u20135.81\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 measured in the study are much higher than those of ASW and the atmosphere (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127, respectively; Stuart et al., 1995), and the 40Ar\/36Ar ratios (323 to 1111 with an average of 737) of the fluids for the Banxi Sb deposit is significantly higher than the atmospheric value of 296.2 (Mark et al., 2011), indicating that the fluids for the Banxi deposit were unlikely generated dominantly from meteoric water. Furthermore, if the magmatic heat flux is injected into the fluid it would have a high He\/heat ratio (3He\/Q) otherwise it would have low 3He\/Q values (Castro et al., 2005, 2007). The 3He\/Q ratio can be obtained through the equation 3He\/Q=3He\/36Ar\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0[36Ar]masw\/(Cp\u03b8), in which [36Ar]masw is the concentration of 36Ar in modified air saturated water (MASW), Cp is the specific heat of MASW, and \u03b8 is the temperature increase in the cold fluid (Burnard and Polya, 2004). The estimated 3He\/Q ratios of the fluids from the Banxi Sb deposit range from 0.17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221215 to 52.47\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221215 cm3 STP J\u22121 (Table 1), which are two to three orders of magnitude lower than those recorded by the hydrothermal fluids of the mid-oceanic ridge vents (0.1\u20131.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212 cm3 STP J\u22121) (Lupton et al., 1989; Baker and Lupton, 1990), and the coeval granite-related W-Sn polymetallic deposits (Fig. 7b) to the east of this deposit, indicating that magmatic-origin fluids may contribute little to ore-forming fluids in the Banxi Sb deposit. The aforementioned evidence suggests that the ore-forming fluids for the Banxi Sb deposit may be dominated by basinal brines. Notably, the relatively low salinity of ore-forming fluids at Banxi compared with that of basinal brines implies minor input of low-salinity water of possible meteoric origin during stibnite precipitation.\n\n\n5.2\nSources of sulfur in ore-forming fluids\nSulfur isotopes can provide insights into the origins of sulfide minerals and the ore-forming temperatures (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Hoefs, 2015). Considering the simple mineral association of stibnite-dominated and absence of sulfate minerals in the Banxi Sb deposit, the \u03b434S values of stibnite can approximately represent that of the total sulfur in ore-forming fluids of this deposit (Seal, 2006). In contrast with prior results using bulk analysis methods (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u20136.7\u2030; Luo, 1994; Li et al., 2019a), the \u03b434S values of stibnite at Banxi acquired by LA-ICP-MS in this study were higher and clustered in a narrow range of 8.0\u20139.5 \u2030, indicating that the sulfur in ore-forming fluids for different mineralization stages in the Banxi Sb deposit had a common origin or was derived from the same source region. These values are higher than those of magmatic sulfur (0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u2030; Ohmoto, 1986) and the stibnite from the adjacent Woxi deposit (\u22122.8\u2030 to \u22122\u2030; Gu et al., 2012), but are close to those from the Xikuangshan Sb deposit (+6.8\u2030 to +10.2\u2030; Fu et al., 2020c) as well as the mean \u03b434S values of sulfides in the Proterozoic basement rocks (+5.6\u2030 to +11.5\u2030; Fig. 8; Jiang et al., 1990; Ma et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2012). Analogously, these basement rocks are also most probably the Sb source for Sb deposits in South China (Fu et al., 2020c; Hu, 2021; Zhai et al., 2021) as these rocks contain the highest Sb abundance in the studied region (7.8\u201327.2\u00a0ppm; Lu et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2002). In addition, hydrothermal leaching experiments indicate that 20\u201390% of Sb can be transferred from this type of rocks to the fluids at 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Niu and Ma, 1991; He and Ma, 1996; Ma et al., 2002), further supporting the Proterozoic basement rocks may have served as the primary source of Sb for the Banxi deposit. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the Proterozoic ore-host rocks or\/and underlying basement sequences may account for the primary sulfur and Sb source of ore-forming fluids for the Banxi Sb deposits.\n\n\n5.3\nTransportation and precipitation mechanism of Sb\nAntimony in natural hydrothermal solutions can be transported in the form of sulfide, hydroxide and chloride complexes, and are primarily controlled by temperatures and pH of hydrothermal systems (Krupp, 1988; Spycher and Reed, 1989; Wood et al., 1987; Oelkers et al., 1998; Zotov et al., 2003; Pokrovski et al., 2006). For example, the sulfide species (e.g., Sb2S4\n2\u2212, HSb2S4\n\u2212) dominate at low temperatures (<200\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C) S-rich solutions of neutral-to-alkaline pH (Williams-Jones and Normand, 1997; Zotov et al., 2003 and references therein). Neutral hydroxide species (e.g., Sb(OH)3) are responsible for the transportation of Sb at temperatures greater than 200\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C over a wide range of pH. In the case of the Banxi Sb deposit, the pH value of ore-forming fluids was estimated at 5.59, based on fluid inclusion microthermometry data (Li et al., 2019a), indicating that the Sb in ore-forming fluids of this deposit might be not complexed with chlorine and sulphur ligands but more likely transported as the stable neutral hydroxyl complexes. A poor correlation between Na and Sb contents (Fig. 10\n) in fluid inclusions trapped in ore-stage quartz from the Banxi Sb deposit further suggests that Sb is probably transported as neutral hydroxyl complexes of Sb(OH)3. Previous experiments have demonstrated that Sb can be transported in the form of neutral hydroxyl complexes Sb(OH)3 in hydrothermal environments over a wide range of temperatures (Pokrovski et al., 2002; Zotov et al., 2003).\nPrevious studies have suggested that the solubility of stibnite in hydrothermal fluids is generally dependent on temperature, pH and sulfur fugacity (Williams-Jones and Normand, 1997; Pokrovski et al., 2002; Obolensky et al., 2007). For example, the solubility of stibnite in hydrothermal solutions is as low as 0.1\u00a0ppm at pH conditions below neutrality (pH\u00a0<\u00a05.6) and stibnite dissolves independently of pH and fO2 while, its solubility increases to 4.6\u00a0ppm Sb at higher pH (Williams-Jones and Normand, 1997). The measured Sb concentrations in fluid inclusions at the Banxi Sb deposit (generally\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0ppm; Fig. 6c) are much higher than the modelled Sb solubility in the acid-weakly alkaline fluids at temperatures of 150\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C (Simpson et al., 2015), suggesting that the fluids responsible for the stibnite precipitation could be alkaline or at least weakly alkaline. This finding is further supported by that an intensive alkaline fluid-rock interaction (reflected by extensive sericitization) was observed enveloping ore veins. Therefore, the pH decreasing during fluid-rock interactions may be an important control of stibnite precipitation. Moreover, as aforementioned, the sulfur in the fluids at Banxi was likely sourced from the dissolution of sulfides (Fig. 4f) in the Proterozoic basement sequences in the Banxi district (BGMRHN, 1988). Thus, we speculate that sulfidation may also be partly responsible for the stibnite precipitation as intensive arsenopyrite of host rock surrounding ore veins.\n\n\n5.4\nComparison with neighboring giant Sb deposits\nIn general, fluid characteristics such as redox state, pressure, temperature, and fluid source regions are the main controls on the concentrations of trace elements in ore minerals (Landtwing and Pettke, 2005; Wark and Watson, 2006; Cook et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2010; Ciobanu et al., 2013; Reich et al., 2013; George et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2020a); therefore, a comparison of the trace element concentrations can be used to reveal the differences in fluid origin and ore-forming processes for various hydrothermal deposits. Compared with the neighboring Woxi and Xikuangshan Sb deposits, stibnite from the Banxi Sb deposit displays a remarkably different trace element composition. For example, stibnite from the Banxi deposit commonly contains measurable Cu and Pb contents, which are comparable to those of the Woxi deposit (varying tens to hundreds of ppm) but are much higher than those of the Xikuangshan deposit that are typically at a level of 0.1\u201310\u00a0ppm (Fu et al., 2020a); moreover, As and Hg contents (Fig. 6a) from the Banxi Sb deposit are generally one or two orders of magnitude lower than those from the Woxi and Xikuangshan Sb deposits (Fu et al., 2020a). The trace element composition of quartz from the Banxi deposit also differs from that of the Woxi and Xikuangshan Sb deposits. For example, the Al concentrations of quartz from the Banxi deposit are much lower than those of the Woxi and Xikuangshan deposits. Generally, Al concentrations in quartz may reflect the ratio of the total Al3+ and Si4+ activities of the hydrothermal fluid, which was experimentally demonstrated to show a negative correlation with the fluid pH (Rusk et al., 2008). Therefore, lower Al concentrations in quartz are probably indicative of a less acid quartz-participating fluid at Banxi than in the Woxi and Xikuangshan deposits. This difference further suggests that the initial fluids at Banxi were likely alkaline in which Al solubility is relatively lower. In addition, quartz from the Banxi deposit is relatively depleted in alkali metals such as Li, Na, K and Ca (Fig. 6b) than those from the Woxi and Xikuangshan Sb deposits (Fu et al., 2020d and Fig. 7 therein), reflecting the different origins of the quartz-participating fluids. These differences in the trace element composition of stibnite and quartz from different Sb deposits indicate that they were probably generated from fluids with distinct origins. These results further suggest that the Banxi deposit was generated from basinal brines, differing from the Woxi deposit dominated by metamorphic fluids (Zhu and Peng, 2015) and the Xikuangshan deposit generated mainly by evolved meteoric water (Ma et al., 2003; Hu and Peng, 2018).\n\n\n5.5\nFormation mechanism of the Banxi deposits\nThe Banxi deposit is generally considered to be a transition between the WX-type and XKS-type Sb deposits, which have some similar characteristics to the former type (e.g., hosted in basement metamorphic rocks) but also show an affinity to the latter type (e.g., characterized by Sb-only mineralization) (Li et al., 2018a; Fu et al., 2019). Considering the geological features and chronological data together with our new data, we invoked a new scenario for the formation of the Banxi Sb deposit: during Early Cretaceous (\u223c130\u00a0Ma), the earlier crustal-scale faults were reactivated as a result of the Yanshanian crustal extension (Hu and Zhou, 2012; Mao et al., 2013), which provided favorable conduits for fluid migration. The weakly alkaline initial fluids circulated through these crustal-scale faults such as fault F1 (a part of the regional Taojiang-Chengbu fault) cutting into the basement sequences, during which leached out a considerable consignment of Sb metals (Li et al., 2019b) as well as sulfurs because of the dissolution of sulfides from underlying and host basement sequences. Subsequently, the decreasing pH of ore-forming fluids coupled with sulfidation during fluid-rock reaction caused Sb metals to precipitate in and\/or around fractures, resulting in the formation of stibnite-quartz ore veins within alteration envelopes in the Banxi Sb deposit. This model is distinct from that described for the origin of the WX-type Sb deposits hosted in basement metamorphic rocks but also differs from that of the XKS-type Sb deposits in sedimentary rocks, suggesting that it may have resulted from a unique event, probably related to the Yanshanian crustal extension during the Early Cretaceous.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nMultiple analyses of individual fluid inclusions, trace element chemistry of cogenetic quartz and stibnite, and He-Ar-S isotopes of hydrothermal sulfides allow a better understanding of the formation mechanism of the Banxi deposit. Individual fluid inclusion analyses suggest that the chemistry of ore-forming fluids at Banxi is distinct from that of magmatic fluids but is comparable to that of basinal fluids. Moreover, remarkable differences in trace element compositions of quartz and stibnite also indicate that the Banxi Sb deposit was probably generated from fluids with a distinct origin. In combination with previous studies and our new data, a new model can be invoked that the weakly alkaline initial fluids dominated by basinal brines circulated through and scavenged Sb and S from the basement metamorphic rocks to form Sb-rich fluids, which then migrated along deep faults and finally precipitated Sb at favorable structural traps (such as fault\/fracture zones) resulting in the formation of the world-class Banxi Sb deposit during Early Cretaceous (\u223c130\u00a0Ma) under an extensional setting.\n\n","19":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nTalc is a mineral utilized in the chemical industry, pharmacy, cosmetics and ceramics, whereas talcose rocks are commonly used as a carving material or gemstone (Dill et al., 2008a; Borowski et al., 2015; Vavro et al., 2015; Pi-Puig et al., 2020). Due to a unique combination of an extremely low hardness, low porosity, flexibility, insulating properties, heat resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high latent heat retention and an ability to temper the ceramics, its usage is dated back to Neolithic (Borowski et al., 2015; Vavro et al., 2015).\nEconomic talc deposits form either from metasomatism of a serpentinized peridotite or by replacement of a dolomitic marble, under the influence of a Si-rich fluid (Anderson et al., 1990; Hecht et al., 1999; El-Sharkawy, 2000; van Gosen et al., 2004; Wilamowski and Wiewi\u00f3ra, 2004; Vavro et al., 2015; Woguia et al., 2021, and references therein). On such basis, talc deposits can be subdivided into the serpentinite-hosted and dolomite-hosted. Within the serpentinite-hosted talc deposits, two subtypes can be distinguished. These are: i) the talcose rocks rich in carbonates, which form in shear zones and faults (fluid migration channels) cutting the serpentinite bodies, and ii) the talcose rocks poor in carbonates, which form at the contact of serpentinite bodies with more siliceous rocks due to metasomatism (van Gosen et al., 2004; Boschi et al., 2006a, 2006b; Ali-Bik et al., 2012). In the Central Europe, economic talc deposits are located in Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dill et al., 2008a, 2008b). Most of these are of Alpine age and belong to the dolomite-hosted type (Dill et al., 2008a, and references therein).\nThere are also a few talc deposits in the Sudetes, in Central Europe, although these are usually volumetrically limited and only several were mined or studied in detail. To that group belong deposits in Kosa\u0159e, Smr\u010dina, Zadn\u00ed Hutisko, P\u0159edn\u00ed Hutisko, \u0160vagrov and M\u011bd'n\u00fd in the Sobot\u00edn Amphibolite Massif of the Silesian Zone (Eastern Sudetes, Czech Republic; Vavro et al., 2015), as well as the Wiry deposit in the \u015al\u0119\u017ca Massif (the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite member; Micyk, 1962; Sachanbi\u0144ski et al., 1991; Sachanbi\u0144ski, 1993), Kletno deposit in the \u015anie\u017cnik Massif (Gil et al., 2020b) and Gil\u00f3w deposit in the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (Dathe and Finckh, 1924; Gil et al., 2020a). The latter three deposits are located in the Central Sudetes (Poland).\nThe Gil\u00f3w deposit, despite economically mined in the past (Dathe and Finckh, 1924), lacks detailed description based on modern analytical techniques. This contribution is a comprehensive \u2013 petrographic, mineralogical, geochemical and isotopic study \u2013 of the Gil\u00f3w talc deposit, on the basis of which, a new formation model of the carbonate-poor, talcose rocks at the serpentinite bodies margins is proposed.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Gil\u00f3w talc deposit is located at the strongly peneplained fore-sudetic section of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (former German Eulengebirge), separated from the mountainous Sudetic section of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif by a Sudetic Boundary Fault (Fig. 1\n). The G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif is a deeply subducted and subsequently exhumed continental block of Saxo-Thuringian affinity (Jastrz\u0119bski et al., 2021), situated in the central part of the Central Sudetes Terrane (Mazur et al., 2015). The entire Central Sudetes Terrane is interpreted as an accretionary prism, located between Saxo-Thuringia and Brunia microplates (Mazur et al., 2015). The Central Sudetes (as well as entire Sudetes; German Sudeten) builds the NE margin of the Bohemian Massif, being the easternmost segment of the European Variscan Belt (Fig. 1).\nThe G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif is thought to be a fragment of the northern Gondwana active margin (Tabaud et al., 2021). The G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif is composed of medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks, mostly migmatitic paragneisses, derived from Neoproterozoic-Cambrian greywackes (Br\u00f6cker et al., 1998; Aftalion and Bowes, 2002; Jastrz\u0119bski et al., 2021; Tabaud et al., 2021), and subordinate orthogneisses, being metamorphic equivalents of ca. 500\u00a0Ma granitoids (Kr\u00f6ner and Hegner, 1998; Kryza and Fanning, 2007; Pin et al., 2007). Gneisses host common felsic granulite (O\u2019Brien et al., 1997; Kryza and Fanning, 2007; Jastrz\u0119bski et al., 2021; Tabaud et al., 2021), metabasite (Winchester et al., 1998; Kryza and Pin, 2002), and variably peridotite and serpentinite lenses (Brueckner et al., 1996; Gunia, 1997). The G\u00f3ry Sowie gneisses are also being cut by numerous granite and granitic pegmatite dykes (Szuszkiewicz et al., 2013; Turniak et al., 2015; W\u0142odek et al., 2015). In addition, a single hornblendite intrusion was also documented (Ilnicki et al., 2019). Metabasites are mostly continental tholeiites (Winchester et al., 1998; Kryza and Pin, 2002), although single occurrences are similar to the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) (Kryza and Pin, 2002). Moreover, several metabasites are proved to be amphibolitized eclogites (Ilnicki et al., 2010, 2011, 2012). Apart from numerous peridotite, serpentinite and metabasite bodies enclosed in the G\u00f3ry Sowie gneisses, the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif is enveloped by the supra-subduction zone (SSZ) Central-Sudetic Ophiolite members, being composed of ultramafic and mafic segments of the ophiolite pseudostratigraphy (Wojtulek et al., 2022). A magmatic age of the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite is assumed to ca. 403\u00a0Ma on the basis of zircon U-Pb ages of metabasites and plagiogranite (Kryza and Pin, 2010; Awdankiewicz et al., 2021), although rodingitization, and likely also early serpentinization, is dated to similar age of ca. 400\u00a0Ma based on the U-Pb age of zircons from the rodingitized gabbro blackwall (Dubi\u0144ska et al., 2004).\nA high-P granulite facies metamorphism affected the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif nearly isochronous ca. 400\u00a0Ma, which is documented by ca. 395\u00a0Ma U-Pb zircon age of felsic granulite from Zag\u00f3rze \u015al\u0105skie (Kryza and Fanning, 2007) and 401.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma 207Pb\/206Pb zircon age of granulites scarce in the massif (O\u2019Brien et al., 1997), as well as 402\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma Sm-Nd garnet-pyroxene-whole rock age of the HP granulite facies garnet peridotite from Bystrzyca G\u00f3rna in the central part of the massif (Brueckner et al., 1996). Slightly younger U-Pb age of 388.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma was obtained for magmatic zircons from hornblendite from Bystrzyca G\u00f3rna (Ilnicki et al., 2019). The major tectonothermal episode in the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif was amphibolite facies metamorphism (sillimanite grade) and pervasive migmatitization, dated to ca. 380\u00a0Ma based on U-Pb age of monazite and xenotime (Br\u00f6cker et al., 1998), 381\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma on monazite U-Pb age, 369\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0Ma on zircon U-Pb age, and 372\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma and 360\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma on Rb-Sr ages of biotite (van Breemen et al., 1988). Next episode, although with the age overlap according several studies, was intrusion of granite and granitic pegmatite dykes. Syn-metamorphic intrusion of granites is supported by 355\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052\u00a0Ma U-Pb age of zircon and 378\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma U-Pb age of monazite from the granite dyke from Walim (Timmermann et al., 2000). Pegmatite emplacement age is better documeted, i.e., it is based on U-Pb monazite ages span of ca. 383\u2013370\u00a0Ma (Timmermann et al., 2000), as well as 380.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0Ma Th-U-total Pb age of uraninite and 377.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma U-Pb age of monazite (Turniak et al., 2015), 373\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma U-Pb age of zircon and 368\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0Ma U-Pb age of xenotime (Budzy\u0144 et al., 2018), and 370\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma Rb-Sr age of muscovite from pegmatite (van Breemen et al., 1988). Jastrz\u0119bski et al. (2021) summarized the major episode of the tectonothermal evolution of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif in four simplified points: i) granulite facies (740\u2013750\u00a0\u00b0C, 1.7\u20131.8 GPa) in granulites and unprecised lower grade metamorphism in gneisses at 395\u2013390\u00a0Ma, ii) progressive decompression of granulites, from 840\u00a0\u00b0C\/\u223c1.7 GPa to 850\u2013860\u00a0\u00b0C\/1.1\u20131.2 GPa, due to a slab break-off, iii) sillimanite grade metamorphism and migmatitization (660\u2013680\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.5\u20130.9 GPa) in gneisses, and tectonic incorporation of granulite slices into these, at 380\u2013375\u00a0Ma, and iv) isostatic exhumation and pegmatites intrusion at 370\u00a0Ma.\nFinally, the eastern margin of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif was subjected to intense mylonitization in Carboniferous, which led to the formation of a regional-scale shear zone called the Niemcza Shear Zone, although the shear zone also comprises mylonitized rocks of the Kamieniec Metamorphic Belt located further east (Fig. 1; Mazur and Puziewicz, 1995). During the cessation of regional shearing, numerous syn-tectonic to late-tectonic, ca. 340\u2013330\u00a0Ma small granitoid bodies intruded the Niemcza Shear Zone (Kr\u00f6ner and Hegner, 1998; Pietranik et al., 2013), as well as the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite (Kryza, 2011) and non-mylonitized segments of the eastern margin of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif, including a Pi\u0142awa G\u00f3rna area (Kr\u00f6ner and Hegner, 1998; Pietranik et al., 2013).\nThe Gil\u00f3w deposit is located ca. 0.5\u00a0km southwest of the Gil\u00f3w village (former German Girlachsdorf) and ca. 2.5\u00a0km north of the Pi\u0142awa G\u00f3rna town (German Gnadenfrei), at the eastern slopes of Gil Hill (429\u00a0m.a.s.l.), also known as Zguba Hill (German Verlorensberg; Dathe and Finckh, 1924). Exploitation of the talc mine near Gil\u00f3w was conducted before World War II. Since then the pit has been abandoned and recently is difficult to distinguish in the landscape. The deposit and its vicinity are covered by soil and vegetation, which makes detailed observations of the sequence of the rocks, in Gil\u00f3w, difficult. The talc deposit is situated in an area predominantly composed of migmatitic paragneisses, enveloping numerous elongated amphibolite (including garnet amphibolite) bodies and a few serpentinite and marble lenses, and hosting one mylonitized zone (Fig. 2\n). Despite not drawn on detailed geological maps (Cwojdzi\u0144ski and Walczak-Augustyniak, 1985; Cymerman and Walczak-Augustyniak, 1988), two serpentinite bodies, as well as single amphibolitized eclogite and granitic pegmatite bodies, were also documented in the close vicinity of the talc mine during our field studies (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nDetailed sampling locations are presented in Table 1\n and Fig. 2. Talcose rock samples were collected directly from the wall of a small, abandoned quarry (the talc mine; Dathe and Finckh, 1924) and as loose blocks from fields, dumps near the forest borderline and from the road cuts. In the case of the wall rocks, migmatitic paragneisses were sampled directly from the outcrops' walls, whereas serpentinites, amphibolitized eclogites and granitic pegmatite were collected mostly as loose blocks (Table 1). In addition to the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w, a structurally-bound Cl content and O isotope data are reported for a one talcose rock sample from the Kletno deposit. Hydrogen isotope data and bulk chemistry of this sample were previously presented in Gil et al. (2020b). The examined samples were cut and thin sectioned, and the remaining material was crushed by a hammer and pulverized to 200 mesh (75\u00a0\u03bcm) in a planetary ball-mill Retsch PM 100, in a 250\u00a0ml corundum jar, at the Faculty of Geology of the University of Warsaw (Poland). Several pure mineral splits were obtained from the coarsely crushed material for O isotope analyses.\nA microfabric of rocks and mineral aggregates, built of talc, chlorite and serpentine group minerals, was named following Wicks and Whittaker (1977). Back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) qualitative analyses, and wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS) quantitative analyses were all carried out on a Cameca SX 100 and Cameca SX FIVE FE electron microprobes (EPMAs). All the microscopic and microprobe works were carried out in the Faculty of Geology (University of Warsaw). The WDS analyses were performed under the 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage and 15nA or 20nA beam current; both the natural and synthetic reference materials were used for callibration and cheking the precision. Under a 15nA beam current talc, chlorite, serpentine group minerals, biotite, muscovite, feldspars, kaolinite, dolomite and pentlandite were analysed, whereas under a 20nA beam current amphiboles, garnet, titanite, allanite, zircon, apatite, spinels, hematite, ilmenite and rutile were analysed. The only exception was Th-U-total Pb chemical dating of monazite under the Cameca SX FIVE FE EPMA, performed in the range of 170\u2013200nA beam currents. Namaqualand (NMQL) monazite with the age of 1033\u00a0Ma (Knoper et al., 2000) was used as the reference material. Samples GL-B, GL-F, GL-3, GL-4, ZGU-5, ZGU-6, ZGU-7 and ZGU-8 were analysed using the Cameca SX 100, while samples GL-5, GL-8A, GL-8B2, GL-10C and GL-12 were analysed using the Cameca SX FIVE FE. More details about the analytical procedures, like a list of spectral lines, counting times and reference materials for individual elements, can be found, for example, in Skridlait\u0117 et al. (2019) or Zozulya et al. (2020). Chlorite group minerals were labelled based on Foster (1962) classification. Amphiboles were classified according to Hawthorne et al. (2012), although tremolite in the sense of Hawthorne et al. (2012) was further subdivided into tremolite and actinolite on the basis of Leake et al. (1997) classification to highlight differences in Mg\/(Mg\u00a0+\u00a0Fe) ratio.\nBulk chemical analyses were performed at Bureau Veritas Minerals (Vancouver, Canada) by means of Spectro Ciros Vision inductively coupled plasma \u2013 emission spectrometer (ICP-ES) in the case of major elements, and PerkinElmer ELAN 6000 or ELAN 9000 inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometers (ICP-MS) in the case of trace elements. In addition, fluorine content was measured by specific ion electrode, and C and S were measured be means of LECO carbon\/sulfur analyzer. For major oxides, as well as Cr, Ba, Ni, Sc, Be, Co, Cs, Ga, Hf, Nb, Rb, Sn, Sr, Ta, Th, U, V, W, Zr, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu contents measurement, powders were fused with a lithium borate, whereas for B, Li, Mo, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Cd, Sb, Bi, Ag, Au, Hg, Tl, Se, B, Te, Ge, In, Re, Pd and Pt determination, powders were digested in a modified aqua regia. Total bulk chlorine content, i.e., sum of structurally-bound chlorine and water-soluble chlorine, was measured at Maxxam Analytics Laboratories (Vancouver, Canada) using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) on powdered samples. Note that reportable detection limits of INAA vary between individual samples from 50 to 130\u00a0ppm depending on Na, Ca, Mn and Al activity. On the basis of the bulk rock major oxides content, a principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., correlation matrix, was performed with the usage of the GCDkit software (Janousek et al., 2006).\nAll stable isotope ratios (O, H, Cl) were measured at the University of Texas (Austin, USA) using a ThermoElectron MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For oxygen isotope analyses, talc and serpentine single-mineral separates were rinsed in dilute HCl to remove potential carbonates, and then, at least five times, rinsed in distilled water and dried. Next, separates were hand-picked under a binocular microscope to ensure a homogeneous sample (i.e., inclusions-free) and analyzed for the O isotope compositions by means of the laser fluorination method of Sharp (1990). Samples were heated with a New Wave Research MIR10-30 laser in the atmosphere of BrF5 and purified O2 was introduced into the IRMS. The garnet standard UWG-2 (\u03b418O value = +5.8\u2030; Valley et al., 1995) and in-house quartz standard Lausanne-1 (\u03b418O value = +18.1\u2030) were analyzed along the samples to check the precision and accuracy of analyses. The measured isotopic compositions were reported as \u03b418O values relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW), and the analytical precision is\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u2030 (1\u03c3).\nBulk rock H and Cl isotope ratios were determined on powdered samples. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Thermo Combustion Elemental Analyzer (TC\/EA) coupled to the IRMS following the method of Sharp et al. (2001) and calibrated using a set of international reference standards (IAEA-CH7, NBS-22, USGS57, USGS58), moreover, one in-house working glass standard were also analyzed along with the samples. Hydrogen isotope composition was reported in standard per mil notation as \u03b4D values relative to SMOW with the precision of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u2030. All samples were duplicated routinely, except of the talcose rock sample GL-D subjected to four runs to make further verification of results; result of a quadrupled sample is consistent with those of the rest of the talcose rocks.\nPrior to Cl isotope analyses, powders were washed five times in ultra-pure (18 M\u03a9) deionized water in order to remove any potential surficial contamination. Then, Cl was extracted from powders by pyrohydrolysis (i.e., melted in a water-vapor stream), and resulting solutions were prepared for Cl isotope analyses following the methods of Eggenkamp (1994). Solutions were reacted with AgNO3 to produce AgCl, which was then reacted with CH3I to produce CH3Cl, the analyte introduced into the IRMS. The Cl isotope composition is expressed as \u03b437Cl, respective to Standard Mean Ocean Chloride (SMOC); the analytical error, based on the long-term laboratory average for internal standards, is\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030 (1\u03c3). In addition, structurally-bound chlorine content was measured in the pyrohydrolysis solutions by ion chromatography (IC).\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrography and minerals chemistry\nField observations of the rock sequence, in the Gil\u00f3w deposit, are difficult due to a poor exposure. Contacts between several rock types are known only from loose blocks. Nevertheless, our observations allow to reconstruct the rock sequence as follows. Pseudomorphic serpentinites gradually transitions to non-pseudomorphic serpentinites or are being cut by non-pseudomorphic serpentinite veins (Fig. 3\n). Non-pseudomorphic serpentinites sharply contacts with the chlorite schist, which, in turn, passes into the talcose rock or talc schist.\n\n4.1.1\nTalcose rocks and talc schists\nTalcose rocks samples, both cropping out in the talc mine (Fig. 4\nA and B) and collected as loose blocks (Fig. 4C and D), are usually monolithic and lack visible contacts with other lithologies. However, single samples (GL-10B, GL-10C) represent the talcose rock contact with the chlorite schist. The contact is commonly sharp and only locally gradual. The talcose rocks are pale-gray (Fig. 4A and B), greenish-gray (Fig. 4C) or yellowish-green (Fig. 4D), but reddish zones in some samples also occur. Foliation is usually flat-parallel and developed in variable degree. The talcose rocks are composed of talc (Fig. 4E\u2013H), and minor chlorite, amphibole and Cr-rich spinels. Typical accessory phase is apatite, but in the talcose rocks contacting with the chorite schist also ilmenite is present. In the latter case, ilmenite occurs in the rock background and as inclusions in talc blades. Talc occurs as very fine (Fig. 4E) to medium blades (Fig. 4F), which are interwoven and randomly oriented, or arranged in similarly oriented stacks and veins, as well as forms an interlocking non-pseudomorphic texture (Fig. 4F). Chlorite occurs as aggregates with an interlocking non-pseudomorphic texture, as parallel-aligned stacks of elongated blades, or as single, coarse blades (Fig. 4G). Two generations of amhiboles are present, i.e., coarse, relic porphyroclasts of calcic amphibole (Fig. 4G), and much more common younger calcic amphiboles, occuring as porphyroblasts and asbestiform needles (Fig. 4H). Moreover, in the talcose rocks contacting with the chlorite schist, composite porphyroblasts, in which a core is built of younger, monoclinic, calcic amphibole, and a discontinuous rim is built of orthorombic amphibole, are present. In the cores of several of these composite porphyroblasts, parallel talc veinlets are present. Cr-rich spinels occurs as subhedral to anhedral grains, often enveloped by a thin chlorite rim. Some Cr-rich spinel grains are cracked with the talc infill of cracks (Fig. 4F). In places, spinel crystals are being partially replaced by chlorite, i.e., isometric aggregates, composed of elongated, parallel-aligned Cr-rich spinel and chlorite \u2013 similar as in the wall rock serpentinites \u2013 are present. Observed replacement textures are as follows: i) older monoclinic amphibole, now present as relics, is replaced by younger monoclinic amphibole, chlorite and talc (Fig. 4G), ii) chlorite is being extensively replaced by monoclinic amphibole of the younger generation (Fig. 4H) or talc (Fig. 4G), and iii) younger monoclinic amphibole is being partially-replaced by talc. Coarse amphiboles (both the older monoclinic amphibole relics and younger monoclinic amphibole porphyroblasts) replacement by talc is further evidenced by pseudomorphs, in which characteristic amphibole cleavage planes are still recognizable due to a concurrent orientation of fine talc blades.\nTalc is characterized by a variable Mg# value, which mostly is greater than 0.9 (i.e., 0.91\u20130.97), with only one analysis showing the lower value (0.87; Appendix 1). A chlorine content of individual talc blades is usually near the detection limit (0.02\u00a0wt%) or below the limit, and only a single talc crystal contains up to 0.07\u00a0wt% Cl (from the talcose rock contact with the chlorite schist). Chlorite classifies as penninite and clinochlore, its Mg# (0.80\u20130.96) and Fe2+\/Sum R2+ (0.04\u20130.20) values, as well as Al2O3 content (13.21\u201321.21\u00a0wt%), show a considerable span (Appendix 2). A chlorine content in chlorite is below the detection limit, with the exception of a single penninite crystal, from the talcose rock contact with the chlorite schist, containing 0.02\u00a0wt% Cl. Relic monoclinic amphibole porphyroclasts (Fig. 4G) classify as pargasite and magnesio-hornblende, whereas younger amphibole, including porphyroblasts and asbestiform needles (Fig. 4H), classify as tremolite. However, according to the classification of Leake et al. (1997), both tremolite and actinolite are present in the younger amphibole group (Appendix 3). The chlorine content in tremolite sensu lato is usually below, or near to the detection limit, although some actinolite crystals contain up to 0.08\u00a0wt% Cl. In the composite porphyroblasts, present in the talcose rocks contacting with the chlorite schist, the monoclinic amphibole core classify as tremolite, and the discontinuous orthorombic amphibole rim classify as anthophyllite. Cr-rich spinel composition is variable, i.e., Al-rich chromite, chromite, ferrichromite, Cr-rich magnetite and magnetite are present. Some spinel grains are zoned: the core is almost always Al-rich chromite and very rare chromite, whereas the rim is chromite, ferrichromite, Cr-rich magnetite or very rare magnetite, depending on an alteration degree. The spinels Mg# value varies from 0.002 to 0.41, and Cr# value from 0.53 to 1.00, in which cores have higher Mg# (0.03\u20130.41) and lower Cr# (0.53\u20130.88), than rims (Mg# = 0.003\u20130.04, Cr# = 0.80\u20131.00) (Appendix 4). Spinels contain up to 0.17\u00a0wt% CoO, 2.13\u00a0wt% ZnO, 0.69\u00a0wt% V2O3, and 2.33\u00a0wt% TiO2. Ilmenite has a relatively high V (0.50\u20130.57\u00a0wt% V2O3) and Nb (0.16\u20131.11\u00a0wt% Nb2O5) concentrations (Appendix 5).\n\n\n4.1.2\nChlorite schist\nThe chlorite schist is fine- to medium-blastic and its color varies from gray to black. Contacts of the chlorite schist with both the talcose rock and serpentinite are commonly sharp (Fig. 3), and only locally the gradual contact of the chlorite schist with the talcose rock can be seen, especially under the microscope. The major phase is chlorite, and Cr-rich spinel occurs as a minor constituent. Accessory phases are amphibole, pimelite, zircon, ilmenite, apatite and monazite. The chlorite schist shows a hourglass pseudomorphic texture or interlocking non-pseudomorphic texture. Amphibole can be subdivided into older, monoclinic amphibole, present as coarse, relic, corroded crystals, and younger, monoclinic amphibole forming coarse, euhedral to subhedral prisms or fine needles (Fig. 5\nA). Coarser apatite grains enclose very fine monazite inclusions, although monazite occurs also in the chlorite background.\nChlorite classify as penninite, with the Mg# value\u00a0\u223c0.94 and Fe2+\/Sum R2+ \u223c0.06 (Appendix 2). Chlorite contains 12.55\u201313.16\u00a0wt% Al2O3, and Cl below the detection limit (Appendix 2). Apatite is abundant both in Cl (0.29\u20130.65\u00a0wt%) and F (0.59\u20130.63\u00a0wt%; Appendix 6). Spinel grains show compositional zoning with the Al-rich chromite core (Mg#\u00a0=\u00a00.15, Cr#\u00a0=\u00a00.85) and Cr-rich magnetite rim (Mg# = 0.17, Cr# = 0.91; Appendix 4). Spinel contains up to 0.22\u00a0wt% CoO, 1.43\u00a0wt% ZnO, 0.10\u00a0wt% V2O3 and 0.07\u00a0wt% TiO2.\n\n\n4.1.3\nPseudomorphic serpentinite\nPseudomorphic serpentinite (the sample GL-3) is dark green and its surface texture is homogeneous. At this serpentinite margins, yellowish-creamy weathering rinds developed. Two subtypes of a pseudomorphic microfabric are predominating, i.e., a hourglass textures and mesh texture after replaced olivine (Fig. 5B), whereas bastite after replaced pyroxene occurs subordinately. In addition, linearly arranged fine magnetite grains outline the edges, cracks and cleavage planes of the replaced protolith's olivine and pyroxene. Minor constituents are Cr-rich spinel, chlorite and dolomite. The latter two are occurring as fine-grained nests sparse in the whole rock, although especially common near the contacts with non-pseudomorphic serpentinite veins. Pentlandite and zircon occur as an accessory phases. Interestingly, zircon forms crystals up to 100\u00a0\u03bcm long, which are especially common adjacent to, and within the non-pseudomorphic serpentinite veins.\nSerpentine is characterized by a narrow range of the Mg# value (0.91\u20130.93), and a Cl content commonly below the detection limit and only occassionally reaching 0.02\u00a0wt% (Appendix 7). Typical chlorite classify as clinochlore with Mg#\u00a0=\u00a00.95, Fe2+\/Sum R2+ value\u00a0=\u00a00.05, Al2O3 content\u00a0=\u00a017.78\u00a0wt%, and Cl below the detection limit (Appendix 2). Cr-rich spinel composition is highly variable, i.e., it spans from Al-rich chromite, through chromite, till magnetite; the spinel Mg# value spans from 0.002 to 0.42, and Cr# value from 0.58 to 1.00 (Appendix 4). Some spinel grains shows a well-developed zoning, with distinctly more magnesian, although similarly chromian, core (Mg# = 0.31, Cr# = 0.63), compared to the rim (Mg# = 0.17, Cr# = 0.63). Spinels contain up to 0.09\u00a0wt% CoO, 1.25\u00a0wt% ZnO, 0.24\u00a0wt% V2O3 and 0.27\u00a0wt% TiO2. Dolomite is rich in FeO (2.29\u20132.73\u00a0wt%), and contains notable MnO (0.54\u20130.59\u00a0wt%) and SrO (0.18\u20130.24\u00a0wt%; Appendix 8). Pentlandite is rich in Co (2.86\u20132.95\u00a0wt%; Appendix 9). Zircon contains 0.82\u20131.10\u00a0wt% HfO2, up to 0.20\u00a0wt% UO2, up to 0.03\u00a0wt% ThO2, PbO below the EPMA detection limit, and is poor in FeO (0.17\u20130.33\u00a0wt%; Appendix 10).\n\n\n4.1.4\nNon-pseudomorphic serpentinite\nNon-pseudomorphic serpentinite (GL-8) is brownish-grey or subordinately bright green in larger blocks, at which surface numerous elongated, reddish-brown spots \u2013 a few minimeters in diameter each \u2013 cause subtle foliation. Non-pseudomorphic serpentinite occurs also in the form of small veins cutting pseudomorphic serpentinite; in such a case non-pseudomorphic serpentinite has a bright green color. In the larger blocks, non-pseudomorphic serpentinite sharply contacts with the chlorite schist. Minor constituents of non-pseudomorphic serpentinite are Cr-rich spinel, chlorite, dolomite and pimelite. Accessory phases are apatite, ilmenite and hematite. Non-pseudomorphic serpentinite shows interlocking (Fig. 5C) and interpenetrating textures, which constitute comparable volumes of the examined samples. Morphology of the protolith peridotite minerals is usually completely obliterated, although in places, linearly arranged fine magnetite grains outline the edges and cleavage planes of replaced olivine and pyroxene (Fig. 5C and D). Interestingly, some zoned Cr-rich spinel grains contain fine, euhedral chlorite inclusions in cores. Secondary, fine-grained serpentine veins cuts the non-pseudomorphic serpentinite groundmass. In addition, several types of nests are present: i) composed of pimelite, ii) composed of dolomite, and containing euhedral to subhedral magnetite crystals, and iii) built of parallel-aligned chlorite blades (pseudomorphs after replaced spinel).\nThe Mg# value of serpentine (0.94\u20130.96\u00a0wt%) in non-pseudomorphic serpentinite is higher than that of serpentine in pseudomorphic serpentinite (Appendix 7). A chlorine content of serpentine in non-pseudomorphic serpentinite is below, or close to the detection limit. Spinel composition is variable and includes Al-rich chromite, chromite, Cr-rich magnetite and magnetite; some grains are zoned \u2013 the core is Al-rich chromite, and the rim is chromite, Cr-rich magnetite or magnetite (Appendix 4). The spinels Mg# value varies from 0.001 to 0.37, and Cr# value from 0.61 to 1.00. In spinel grains with the well-developed zoning, the core is more magnesian and less chromian (Mg# = 0.24\u20130.37, Cr# = 0.61\u20130.71), than the rim (Mg# = 0.002\u20130.01, Cr# = 0.99\u20131.00). Spinels contain up to 0.18\u00a0wt% CoO, 1.27\u00a0wt% ZnO, 0.21\u00a0wt% V2O3 and 0.19\u00a0wt% TiO2. Apatite is abundant in both Cl (0.24\u20130.31\u00a0wt%) and F (0.61\u20130.68\u00a0wt%; Appendix 6). Hematite is abundant in Cr2O3 (3.78\u20136.51\u00a0wt%) and contains notable NiO (0.25\u20130.39\u00a0wt%; Appendix 11).\n\n\n4.1.5\nAmphibolitized eclogite\nGarnet amphibolites (eclogites retrograded in amphibolite facies) are fine- to coarse-grained, dark gray rocks, comprising amphibole, garnet, plagioclase and clinopyroxene with accessory Ti-phases (ilmenite, rutile, titanite), chlorite, quartz and epidote. In places are cut by 2\u20133\u00a0mm thick white quartz veins. Garnet forms porphyroblasts up to 3\u00a0mm in diameter, abundant in inclusions of quartz, rutile, amphibole and plagioclase. The porphyroblasts are surrounded by coronas of strongly pleochroic amphibole and plagioclase (Fig. 5E); however, they are fully preserved only in a few samples (e.g., GL-1). The matrix between garnet crystals is composed of plagioclase-clinopyroxene symplectites, in which the latter mineral is to different degree replaced by secondary amphibole. In the most retrogressed samples (like GL-4 subjected to chemical and isotopic studies), the symplectites are completely obliterated by recrystallization into a fine groundmass, composed of amphibole and plagioclase, while coronas are strongly reduced and rimmed by fibrous amphibole and chlorite. Noteworthy, coarse amphibole grains in the matrix are zonal. Ilmenite crystals, mantled by amphibole, developed titanite rims and often contain a rutile core.\nCores of amphibole grains classify as magnesio-ferri-hornblende, whereas rims as ferro-hornblende or ferro-tschermakite (Appendix 3). Amphibole crystals mantling ilmenite classify as ferro-tschermakite, and amphibole mantling titanite as magnesio-ferri-hornblende. In addition, fibrous amphibole, building outer parts of the coronas around garnet, is ferro-sadanagaite. Amphiboles are Cl-poor (i.e., Cl is usually below the detection limit), although ferro-hornblende and ferro-tschermakite, forming the zoned amphiboles rims, as well as ferro-tschermakite mantling ilmenite, contain 0.03\u20130.04\u00a0wt% Cl. Most plagioclases are of andesine composition (An42-49), with the exception of those forming coronas on garnets, which are usually oligoclase (An23; Appendix 12). Garnet represents an almandine-grossular-pyrope solid-solution (Prp18-21Alm51-55Sps2Grs24-26; Appendix 13). Garnet is poor in V2O3 (0.02\u20130.05\u00a0wt%) and TiO2 (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0wt%). Chlorite classifies as brunsvigite; it shows Mg# = 0.46, Fe2+\/Sum R2+ value\u00a0=\u00a00.53, Al2O3 content\u00a0=\u00a020.39\u00a0wt%, and it is Cl-free (Appendix 2). Titanite contains 1.54\u00a0wt% Fe2O3, 1.54\u00a0wt% Al2O3, 0.14\u00a0wt% V2O3, and is Zr- and Nb-free (Appendix 14). Ilmenite contains 0.45\u20130.47\u00a0wt% V2O3 (Appendix 5). Ilmenite enclosed in ferro-tschermakite contains 0.07\u00a0wt% Nb2O5 in contrast to ilmenite enclosed in titanite, which is Nb-free. Rutile contains 0.35\u00a0wt% V2O3, 0.06\u00a0wt% Nb2O5 and 0.04\u00a0wt% ZrO2 (Appendix 5).\n\n\n4.1.6\nMigmatitic paragneiss\nMigmatitic paragneiss is banded. Compositional bands, i.e., leucosome and melanosome, are parallel to the folded main foliation. Leucosome is creamy to yellowish and up to 20\u00a0mm thick, whereas dark gray to black melanosome thickness does not exceed 3\u00a0mm. Major primary constituents of paragneiss are K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, biotite, muscovite and garnet, whereas secondary phases are chlorite, sericite and kaolinite. Ilmenite, zircon and monazite occur as accessory phases. Some of the larger K-feldspar crystals enclose quartz, plagioclase and muscovite, as well as quartz-plagioclase aggregates. Myrmekites are present at the K-feldspar contact with plagioclase. Some K-feldspar grains are kaolinized, although kaolinite-group minerals occur also as veinlets. Biotite is chloritized in places. Garnet occurs as coarse grains associated with biotite, and as fine inclusions in coarse quartz grains. Several garnets \u2013 irrespective of a textural position \u2013 are cracked, and biotite chloritized in variable degree fills the cracks.\nPlagioclase has an oligoclase composition (An20-27; Appendix 12). Biotite classifies as annite, its Mg# value (0.44\u20130.49) shows a narrow span, and it contains notable Cl (0.02\u20130.05\u00a0wt%; Appendix 15). A muscovite Cl content is often below the detection limit and does not exceed 0.02\u00a0wt% (Appendix 16). Garnet is an almandine-pyrope solid-solution (Prp17-19Alm72-74Sps5-6Grs3), poor in V2O3 (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0wt%), TiO2 (0.02\u20130.03\u00a0wt%) and Y2O3 (\u223c0.04\u00a0wt%; Appendix 13). Chlorite classifies as ripidolite and brunsvigite, its Mg# = 0.48\u20130.51, Fe2+\/Sum R2+ value\u00a0=\u00a00.49\u20130.51, and contains 20.44\u201321.08\u00a0wt% Al2O3 and up to 0.02\u00a0wt% Cl (Appendix 2). The chlorine content of kaolinite-group minerals is near the detection limit (Appendix 16). Ilmenite contains 0.32\u00a0wt% V2O3 and 0.03\u00a0wt% Nb2O5 (Appendix 5).\n\n\n4.1.7\nGranitic pegmatite\nGranitic pegmatite is composed of coarse, bright gray to creamy crystals distributed irregularly, and several fine, black crystals and brownish-stained zones, sparse in the groundmass. Pegmatite is predominantly composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, chlorite and apatite. Accessory minerals are titanite, zircon, allanite-clinozoisite solid-solution, monazite, rutile and galena. Quartz occurs as coarse grains, building the rock groundmass jointly with K-feldspar and plagioclase, as well as fine- to medium-grained quartz and quartz-chlorite veins, filling interstices between feldspars or cutting feldspar grains. Several K-feldspar grains are slightly kaolinised, and plagioclase grains are slightly saussuritised in places. Apatite is medium- to coarse-grained and often arranged in elongated aggregates. Apatite encloses allanite-clinozoisite solid-solution crystals and subordinate monazite. Apatite and titanite are enveloped by chlorite. Zircon occurs as fine, euhedral prisms.\nA K-feldspar composition varies from poor in Ba (0.33\u00a0wt% BaO) to Ba-rich (5.55\u00a0wt% BaO; Appendix 12). Most of plagioclase (An26-33) has the oligoclase composition and only seldom has the andesine composition (Appendix 12). Chlorite is represented by brunsvigite; its Mg# (0.47\u20130.52) and Fe2+\/Sum R2+ (0.47\u20130.52) values, and Al2O3 content (20.13\u201320.93\u00a0wt%), show a limited range, and its Cl content is usually below the detection limit, only sporadically reaching 0.02\u00a0wt% (Appendix 2). The apatite Cl content is low (0.04\u20130.09\u00a0wt%), whereas the F content high (2.55\u20132.93\u00a0wt%; Appendix 6). Titanite is poor in Fe2O3 (0.21\u20130.62\u00a0wt%), abundant in Al2O3 (0.77\u20132.02\u00a0wt%), and very poor in V2O3 (0.04\u20130.06\u00a0wt%) and Nb2O5 (up to 0.17\u00a0wt%; Appendix 14). Zircon contains 1.10\u00a0wt% HfO2, 0.20\u00a0wt% UO2, ThO2 and PbO below the detection limit, and 0.19\u00a0wt% FeO (Appendix 10). Allanite-clinozoisite solid-solution crystals contain 0.27\u20130.29\u00a0wt% SrO, 0.74\u20130.90\u00a0wt% Y2O3, 1.34\u20132.05\u00a0wt% La2O3, 4.38\u20135.78\u00a0wt% Ce2O3, 3.69\u20134.04\u00a0wt% Nd2O3, 0.88\u20130.99\u00a0wt% Sm2O3, and up to 0.04\u00a0wt% Cl (Appendix 17).\n\n\n\n4.2\nBulk chemical composition\nTalcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w are characterized by a narrow range of SiO2 (57.30\u201360.46\u00a0wt%), MgO (24.27\u201327.21\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (5.06\u20135.12\u00a0wt%), TiO2 (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0wt%), Cr (2121.0\u20132148.4\u00a0ppm) and Co (57.4\u201384.8\u00a0ppm) contents, whereas Al2O3 (1.38\u20133.04\u00a0wt%), CaO (0.86\u20134.39\u00a0wt%) and Ni (1079\u20131561\u00a0ppm) contents in the talcose rocks show a larger span (Table 2\n). Especially high contents of MgO, Fe2O3, Cr, Ni and Co are notable as these elements are indicative of a genetic relation with ultrabasic rocks (i.e., a mantle material). Total Rare Earth Elements (REE) content (without Y) of the talcose rocks is low and relatively varied (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a02.13\u201313.81\u00a0ppm). The talcose rocks are characterized by a high and variable F content (197\u2013337\u00a0ppm).\nSerpentinites \u2013 without subdivision into a pseudomorphic and non-pseudomorphic variety, as bulk contents of major elements are relatively constant regardles petrographic and mineralogical differences \u2013 are poor in SiO2 (43.38\u201344.33\u00a0wt%), Al2O3 (1.18\u20131.56\u00a0wt%), CaO (0.04\u20130.58\u00a0wt%) and TiO2 (<0.01\u20130.02\u00a0wt%), and rich in MgO (34.16\u201334.21\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (6.75\u20137.14\u00a0wt%), Cr (2271.6\u20132292.1\u00a0ppm), Ni (1682\u20131891\u00a0ppm) and Co (81.9\u201389.5\u00a0ppm). Contents of these elements are comparable to those in the talcose rocks, and only slightly higher in the case of MgO, Fe2O3, Cr, Ni and Co, and slightly lower in the case of Al2O3, TiO2 and CaO. The most significant difference in the major elements contents, between serpentinites and talcose rocks, concerns the SiO2 content, in which serpentinites are less abundant than the talcose rocks. The total REE content in serpentinites (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a05.49\u20137.30\u00a0ppm) is constant and slightly lower than that, of most of the talcose rocks. Interestingly, serpentinites are relatively rich in F (40\u201399\u00a0ppm), although still nearly an order of magnitude poorer than the talcose rocks.\nThe examined amphibolitized eclogite has high concentrations of Al2O3 (16.55\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (12.08\u00a0wt%), CaO (8.84\u00a0wt%) and TiO2 (1.85\u00a0wt%), and low MgO (3.95\u00a0wt%), Cr (47.9\u00a0ppm), Ni (3.5\u00a0ppm) and Co (26.5\u00a0ppm). Cobalt, and especially nickel, contents are low in compare with most mafic rocks. The silica (52.99\u00a0wt% SiO2) and fluorine (184\u00a0ppm) contents of amphibolitized eclogite are intermediate between the contents of talcose rocks and serpentinites (Table 2). The total REE content of amphibolitized eclogite (111.77\u00a0ppm) is one-two orders of magnitude higher than \u03a3REE of the talcose rocks and serpentinites. Amphibolitized eclogite has a Zr\/Nb ratio\u00a0=\u00a043.2.\nMigmatitic paragneiss is the most abundant in SiO2 (67.77\u201377.39\u00a0wt%) among the examined rocks from Gil\u00f3w. The aluminum (11.06\u201316.24\u00a0wt% Al2O3) content of paragneiss is high, whereas the titanium (0.49\u20130.65\u00a0wt% TiO2) content intermediate, and the magnesium (1.29\u20131.64\u00a0wt% MgO) content low (Table 2). The iron content of paragneiss (3.38\u20134.27\u00a0wt% Fe2O3) is slightly lower than the content of talcose rocks, and the CaO content (1.43\u20132.18\u00a0wt%) is comparable. Chromium (54.7\u00a0ppm), nickel (25\u201328\u00a0ppm) and cobalt (9.0\u201310.9\u00a0ppm) contents of paragneiss are constant and relatively high as for felsic rocks, but about one-two orders of magnitude lower than the contents of talcose rocks and serpentinites. Migmatitic paragneiss is characterized by the highest \u03a3REE (137.41\u2013161.49\u00a0ppm) amongst the examined rocks, and the F content of paragneiss (231\u2013286\u00a0ppm) is comparable with the content of talcose rocks.\nA granitic pegmatite SiO2 content (62.28\u00a0wt%) is high, and the TiO2 content (0.04\u00a0wt%) low (Table 2). The calcium content of pegmatite (5.07\u00a0wt% CaO) is high, even higher than the content in the most Ca-rich talcose rocks, and lower only than the CaO content of amphibolitized eclogite. The content of Al2O3 in pegmatite (23.23\u00a0wt%) is the highest amongst the examined rocks; on the other hand, MgO (0.13\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (0.31\u00a0wt%), Cr (1.6\u00a0ppm) and Co (1.5\u00a0ppm) contents of pegmatite are the lowest in the studied samples set. Similarly, the Ni content of pegmatite (3.4\u00a0ppm) is the lowest amongst the examined rocks, although very similar to the Ni content of amphibolitized eclogite. Noteworthy, pegmatite is poor in F (78\u00a0ppm), which content is comparable to the content in serpentinites, and significantly lower than the contents in the remaining lithologies. The total REE content of pegmatite (32.07\u00a0ppm) is relatively low, and a couple times lower than \u03a3REE of amphibolitized eclogite and migmatitic paragneiss, although a couple times higher than \u03a3REE of the talcose rocks and serpentinites.\n\n\n4.3\nStable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios\nThe talcose rocks (GL-6, GL-C, GL-F) have the highest \u03b418O values (\u03b418O = +8.3\u2030 to\u00a0+8.7\u2030) amongst the examined samples from Gil\u00f3w. However, a comparable talcose rock from the Kletno deposit has even higher \u03b418O value of\u00a0+9.5\u2030. In contrast, serpentinite with a predominating pseudomorphic texture (GL-3) has the lowest \u03b418O value (+5.7\u2030) amongst the rocks from Gil\u00f3w (Table 3\n), which is within the range of abyssal serpentinites (\u03b418O value \u2248 +1.0\u2030 to\u00a0+6.0\u2030; Wenner and Taylor, 1973; Barnes et al., 2009). Non-pseudomorphic serpentinite (GL-8) has a notably higher \u03b418O value (+7.1\u2030).\nThe talcose rocks are characterized by a very uniform hydrogen isotope composition (\u03b4D values from \u221252\u2030 to \u221248\u2030), which are the highest among the examined samples (Table 3). The hydrogen isotope composition of pseudomorphic serpentinite is considerably lower (\u03b4D value\u00a0=\u00a0\u221264\u2030), although the \u03b4D value of non-pseudomorphic serpentinite (\u03b4D value\u00a0=\u00a0\u221248\u2030) is similar to that of the talcose rocks. Amphibolitized eclogite has the lowest \u03b4D value (-75\u2030) amongst the examined samples, whereas migmatitic paragneiss \u03b4D values (-69\u2030 to \u221266\u2030) are similar to that of pseudomorphic serpentinite.\n\n\n4.4\nChlorine content and stable isotope data\nAll analyzed samples have a low total chlorine content (a sum of a structurally-bound chlorine and water soluble chlorine), i.e., below the INAA detection limit (Table 3). The structurally-bound chlorine content of talcose rocks (3\u201312\u00a0ppm Cl) is the lowest amongst the examined rocks from Gil\u00f3w. Noteworthy, a comparable talcose rock sample from the Kletno deposit has a similar, low Cl content (4\u00a0ppm). Pseudomorphic serpentinite from Gil\u00f3w has considerably higher Cl content (30\u00a0ppm), which is slightly higher than that of non-pseudomorphic serpentinite (21\u00a0ppm). Amphibolitized eclogite structurally-bound chlorine content is even lower (18\u00a0ppm). Migmatitic paragneiss samples are the most abundant in Cl (32\u201337\u00a0ppm), and the granitic pegmatite Cl content (24\u00a0ppm) is comparable with the content of serpentinites.\nThe talcose rocks from the Gil\u00f3w deposit are characterized by highly negative to near-zero \u03b437Cl values (\u03b437Cl values span from \u22122.6\u2030 to \u22120.1\u2030; Table 3). Pseudomorphic serpentinite has the highest \u03b437Cl value (+2.0\u2030) amongst the studied samples. In contrast, non-pseudomorphic serpentinite has the near-zero \u03b437Cl value (\u22120.1\u2030), which is similar as in the talcose rock sample with the highest \u03b437Cl. Clearly negative \u03b437Cl value\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.5\u2030 was reported also for amphibolitized eclogite. Migmatitic paragneiss is characterized by the \u03b437Cl values range from clearly negative to near-zero (\u03b437Cl values span from \u22121.0\u2030 to\u00a0+0.1\u2030). The near-zero \u03b437Cl value was reported also for granitic pegmatite (\u03b437Cl\u00a0=\u00a00.0\u2030).\n\n\n4.5\nMonazite composition and Th-U-total Pb dating\nMonazite grains from the chlorite schist, separating talcose rocks and non-pseudomorphic serpentinites, were subjected to detailed chemical characteristics and dating. However, monazites from the chlorite schist adjacent to serpentinite and chlorite schist adjacent to the talcose rock, were treated separately due to pronounced differences in the chemical composition and calculated age.\nThe monazite grains in the chlorite schist adjacent to the talcose rocks, are present in the chlorite matrix, where forms ca. 3\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm long crystals. These monazite grains show no zoning, although several are altered, i.e., such grains are dismembered and have irregular edges. The fresh monazite grains have high ThO2 (6.59\u20139.26\u00a0wt%), and low UO2 (0.46\u20131.01\u00a0wt%), PbO (0.13\u20130.18\u00a0wt%), FeO (0.23\u20130.40\u00a0wt%) and ZrO2 contents (0.07\u20130.10\u00a0wt%; Appendix 18). An yttrium content is low and only slightly varied (0.54\u20130.94\u00a0wt% Y2O3). The examined monazites have Th-U-total Pb dates ranging from 394\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049\u00a0Ma (1\u03c3) to 342\u00a0\u00b1\u00a056\u00a0Ma (1\u03c3) (Appendix 18). The weighted mean age of monazites from the chlorite schist, adjacent to the talcose rock, is 365.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2\u00a0Ma (2\u03c3). Note that an altered monazite grain differ in a composition and shows geologically completely meaningless dating of 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0106\u00a0Ma (2\u03c3), thus it was exclued from the mean age calculation. Chemical composition of this altered monazite grain is not provided in the text and is available in supplementary materials (Appendix 18) only.\nIn the chlorite schist adjacent to serpentinite, monazite occurs as fine crystals (ca. 10\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm long) in the chlorite matrix (Fig. 5F), and also as very fine (ca. 0.5\u20132\u00a0\u03bcm long) inclusions in apatite. In both textural positions, monazite grains show no zoning. Only monazite occurring in the chlorite background size was sufficient to perform a reliable chemical dating, thus it was a subject of an investigation. This monazite has high ThO2 (3.14\u20135.69\u00a0wt%) and UO2 (0.58\u20133.42\u00a0wt%), and low PbO (0.10\u20130.28\u00a0wt%), FeO (0.21\u20131.41\u00a0wt%) and ZrO2 (from below the detection limit to 0.11\u00a0wt%) contents (Appendix 18). The yttrium content is relatively high and shows a moderate variation (1.01\u20132.49\u00a0wt% Y2O3). This monazite grains have Th-U-total Pb dates ranging from 461\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088\u00a0Ma (1\u03c3) to 375\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0Ma (1\u03c3) (Appendix 18). The weighted mean age of monazites, from the chlorite schist adjacent to serpentinite, is 389.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4\u00a0Ma (2\u03c3).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nQuality of the talc ore and association to the metallogenic province\nTalc from the Gil\u00f3w deposit does not meet the criteria for the raw material for pharmacy and cosmetics (Pi-Puig et al., 2020, and references therein) due to the high content of several heavy metals (2121.0\u20132148.4\u00a0ppm Cr, 1079\u20131561\u00a0ppm Ni; Table 2) and presence of asbestiform minerals in the ore, i.e., tremolite (both tremolite and actinolite sensu Leake et al., 1997) and anthophyllite are present (Appendix 3). However, a quality of the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w is sufficient as for the talc ore for ceramics and as a carving material, i.e., the quality is similar to that of talc mentioned by Borowski et al. (2015) and Vavro et al. (2015). The talc ore quality was sufficient to justify the exploitation in Gil\u00f3w, in the past (Dathe and Finckh, 1924). A location in the Variscan G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif, and monazite dates of ca. 390\u00a0Ma and ca. 365\u00a0Ma, links the Gil\u00f3w talc deposit formation with the Variscan metallogenic event (Variscan metallogenic province), which is in contrast to a majority of the European talc deposits, formed during the Alpine metallogenic event (Alpine metallogenic province) (Dill et al., 2008a, 2008b). Besides Gil\u00f3w, only Wiry and Kletno (Poland), Kosa\u0159e, Smr\u010dina, Zadn\u00ed Hutisko, P\u0159edn\u00ed Hutisko, \u0160vagrov and M\u011bd'n\u00fd (Czech Republic), and Sinatengr\u00fcn, G\u00f6pfersgr\u00fcn, Thiersheim I, Schwarzenbach a.d. s\u00e4chs\/Saale, Wirsberg and Erbendorf (Germany), were formed during the Variscan orogeny (Micyk, 1962; Sachanbi\u0144ski et al., 1991; Sachanbi\u0144ski, 1993; Dill et al., 2008a; Vavro et al., 2015; Dill and Kolb, 2019; Gil et al., 2020b).\n\n\n5.2\nGenetic type of talcose rocks\nThe talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w belong to the serpentinite-hosted type (Anderson et al., 1990; Hecht et al., 1999; van Gosen et al., 2004; Wilamowski and Wiewi\u00f3ra, 2004; Vavro et al., 2015; Woguia et al., 2021) as evidenced by high Cr, Ni and Co contents, i.e., 2121.0\u20132148.4\u00a0ppm, 1079\u20131561\u00a0ppm and 57.4\u201384.8\u00a0ppm, respectively. These contents are comparable with the contents of adjacent serpentinites (Fig. 6\n) and much higher than the contents of dolomitic marbles and their derivatives. Because the talcose rocks form as a result of serpentinites and dolomitic marbles metasomatism similar as nephrites, it is expected that oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios, diagnostic for the nephrite genetic types (Gil et al., 2015b), may be useful also for discrimination of talc genetic types. In the case of nephrite, O and H isotope compositions of serpentinite-related nephrites are similar to those of serpentinites \u2013 although the \u03b418O value of nephrite is usually slightly elevated relative to serpentinite \u2013 whereas \u03b418O and \u03b4D values of dolomite-related nephrites are more scattered and usually differ from those of marbles and serpentinite-related nephrites. In general, serpentinite-related nephrites are characterized by the \u03b418O values between\u00a0+4.5\u2030 and\u00a0+9.6\u2030, and \u03b4D values from \u221284\u2030 to \u201333\u2030, while dolomite-related nephrites are characterized by the \u03b418O values span \u221218.2\u2030 to\u00a0+10.4\u2030, and the \u03b4D values from \u2212179\u2030 to \u221228\u2030 (Yiu et al., 1988; Yui and Kwon, 2002; Liu et al., 2011a, 2011b, 2016; Burtseva et al., 2015; Gil et al., 2015a, 2015b; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Oxygen (\u03b418O values = +8.3\u2030 to\u00a0+8.7\u2030) and hydrogen (\u03b4D values\u00a0=\u00a0\u221252\u2030 to \u221248\u2030) isotope ratios of talc from Gil\u00f3w are in the range of both serpentinite-related and dolomite-related nephrites, although it is noticeable that the span of values reported for serpentinite-related nephrites is much narrower. Moreover, the \u03b418O and \u03b4D values of the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w are comparable to those of the serpentinite-hosted talcose rocks from the Kletno deposit (\u03b418O value = +9.5\u2030 (Table 3) and \u03b4D value\u00a0=\u00a0\u221262\u2030 (Gil et al. (2020)). Moreover, the \u03b418O to \u03b4D ratio of talc from Gil\u00f3w is similar to that of serpentinite-related nephrites, and only a few dolomite-related nephrite samples are characterized by a comparable ratio (Fig. 7\n). The \u03b418O and \u03b4D values of talc from Gil\u00f3w are comparable with the values of serpentinites from Gil\u00f3w (\u03b418O values = +5.7\u2030 to\u00a0+7.1\u2030; \u03b4D values\u00a0=\u00a0\u221264\u2030 to \u221248\u2030), and differ from the values of dolomite-derived talc veins from the Chuncheon nephrite deposit in South Korea (talc \u03b418O values\u00a0=\u00a0\u22127.7\u2030 to \u22127.3\u2030, and \u03b4D values\u00a0=\u00a0\u221290\u2030 to \u221286\u2030; Fig. 7; Yui and Kwon, 2002).\nFurther subdivision of serpentinite-hosted talc occurrences (Ali-Bik et al., 2012) classifies the Gil\u00f3w deposit along talc deposits formed at the serpentinite bodies margins as an effect of contact metasomatism with more siliceous rock subtypes, due to the lack of carbonates in the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w and associated high talc content. The another subtype of the serpentinite-hosted talc deposits is not restricted to serpentinite bodies margins, i.e., form in shear zones and faults cutting serpentinites, but the talcose rocks in that subtype of deposits are rich in carbonates (Ali-Bik et al., 2012, and references therein). The lack of carbonates in the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w is in contrast to wall rock serpentinites, in which dolomite is present.\nAccording to the classification scheme of mineral deposits, based on a geodynamic setting (Dill et al., 2008a), the Gil\u00f3w talc deposit should be classified into the thrust-bound and fold-related metamorphogenic deposits, and more detailed as the thrust-bound talc and asbestos deposits in (ultra)basic igneous rocks, as it is spatially related with serpentinite bodies enclosed in the strongly folded metamorphic massif, and several faults and mylonitic zones are present in Gil\u00f3w (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\n\n5.3\nGeotectonic setting of ultrabasites and basites\nUltrabasite, and especially metabasite bodies, scarce in the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif, are thought to be formed during a continental rifting of Saxothuringia, in an extensional, within-plate setting, or continental passive margin setting (Winchester et al., 1998; Kryza and Pin, 2002). Typical ultrabasites of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif are mantle-derived, garnet- and clinopyroxene-bearing peridotites, equilibrated in HP granulite facies (Brueckner et al., 1996). It is believed that G\u00f3ry Sowie ultrabasites did not represent abyssal peridotites, incorporated into the continental crust, as well as metabasites are not formed in the mid-ocean ridge (MOR) setting (ultrabasites and basites are not interpreted as ophiolite).\nUltrabasites from Gil\u00f3w, however, are not represented by peridotites, but only by a completely serpentinized rocks, without relics of peridotite phases. Garnet, as well as pseudomorphs after garnet, are absent in the examined serpentinites. Moreover, serpentinites from Gil\u00f3w show LREE\/HREE enrichment (Fig. 8\nA), a feature typical of ophiolitic serpentinites (Dilek and Yang, 2018). A majority of chlorine, present in the most primitive serpentinite sample from Gil\u00f3w (i.e., pseudomorphic serpentinite GL-3), is incorporated in serpentine group minerals (up to 0.02\u00a0wt% Cl; Appendix 7), which is typical for metaperidotites subjected to the seafloor metamorphism. Moreover, the most primitive serpentinite sample O and Cl isotope ratios (\u03b418O value = +5.7\u2030, \u03b437Cl value = +2.0\u2030) are similar to those of abyssal serpentinites, i.e., abyssal serpentinites \u03b418O value \u2248 +1.0\u2030 to\u00a0+6.0\u2030 (Wenner and Taylor, 1973; Barnes et al., 2009), and the \u03b437Cl value of serpentinite is positive if peridotite was serpentinized by seawater (Barnes et al., 2006). In addition, the examined amphibolitized eclogite has a MORB-like, flat REE pattern (Fig. 8A), and Zr\/Nb ratio = 43.2, both suggesting genetic relation with an ocean floor or back arc basin floor. However, it is not certain whether amphibolites and serpentinites from Gil\u00f3w are cogenetic, as amphibolites show evidences for a high-P metamorphism (e.g., garnet with amphibole-plagioclase coronas, clinopyroxene-plagioclase symplectites in the matrix), whereas the examined serpentinites did not show evidences for high-P conditions (e.g., garnet and pseudomorphs after garnet are absent). Amphibolitized eclogite REE and trace elements patterns differ from those of serpentinites (Fig. 8A and B), which also not supports the common origin and metamorphic-metasomatic history.\nSerpentinites from Gil\u00f3w differences relative to typical ultrabasites of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif, and serpentinites and amphibolite from Gil\u00f3w similarities with ophiolitic rocks, suggest that ultrabasites, and likely also metabasites, from Gil\u00f3w not belong to the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif, but are fragments of an ancient seafloor. Occurrence of the ophiolitic sequence members in their present position can be caused by a subduction of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (Saxothuringia) beneath an unspecified island arc, existing in the Saxothuringian Ocean (Jastrz\u0119bski et al., 2021), and subsequent erosion of the upper, oceanic plate. Alternatively, serpentinites (and perhaps also amphibolitized eclogite) can belong to the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite. That scenario cannot be ruled out as the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite is interpreted as overthrusted onto the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (Dubi\u0144ska and Gunia, 1997), and it is believed that the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif and Central-Sudetic Ophiolite were already in direct contact ca. 380\u00a0Ma (\u017bela\u017aniewicz, 1990). The Gil\u00f3w deposit is located merely\u00a0\u223c2.5\u00a0km away from the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif border with the Niemcza Shear Zone (hosting the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite fragments), and\u00a0\u223c3.0\u00a0km away from the nearest serpentinite body outcrop in the Niemcza Shear Zone. Noteworthy, a transition from the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif to the Niemcza Shear Zone is gradual and adjacent areas of this shear zone are predominantly composed of mylonitized G\u00f3ry Sowie gneisses (Mazur and Puziewicz, 1995).\n\n\n5.4\nTalcose rocks formation age and fluid source\nThe age of the talcose rocks formation is constrained by the Th-U-total Pb chemical dating of monazite from the chlorite schist adjacent to serpentinite (389.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4\u00a0Ma), and of monazite from the chlorite schist adjacent to the talcose rock (365.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2\u00a0Ma). Older of these dates is similar to the 388.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma SHRIMP U-Pb age of zircon from hornblendite of Bystrzyca G\u00f3rna (Ilnicki et al., 2019), as well as the age of the pressure peak in the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (high-P granulite facies, \u223c395\u2013390\u00a0Ma; Kryza and Fanning, 2007; Jastrz\u0119bski et al., 2021). However, similarity with the age of hornblendite from Bystrzyca G\u00f3rna should be treated with caution, because, till now, there are any evidence for hornblendite presence in Gil\u00f3w or its surroundings. Similarity of the date of monazite, from the contact zone (chlorite schist), with the pressure peak age, on the other hand, suggests that this date can reflect serpentinite juxtaposition with the country paragneiss, as this juxtaposition can take place under high-P conditions (e.g., can be caused by overthrusting). In such a scenario, 389.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4\u00a0Ma monazite date reflects subduction of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (Saxothuringia) beneath an unspecified island arc (which was subsequently eroded), or the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif juxtaposition with the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite, e.g., the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite overthrusting onto the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif (Dubi\u0144ska and Gunia, 1997). The latter interpretation is consistent with the view that the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite and G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif were already in a direct contact ca. 380\u00a0Ma (\u017bela\u017aniewicz, 1990). Note that these interpretations are not excluding each other if the hypothetical island arc was a part of the same oceanic lithosphere as the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite.\nThe older monazite dating can reflect the contact zone (chlorite) formation, whereas the younger (365.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2\u00a0Ma) likely dates subsequent amphiboles and talc crystallization. The younger date overlaps, within an analytical uncertainty, ca. 380\u2013370\u00a0Ma age span of amphibolite facies metamorphism, country paragneiss anatexis, and granites and pegmatites intrusion (van Breemen et al., 1988; Br\u00f6cker et al., 1998; Timmermann et al., 2000; Turniak et al., 2015; Budzy\u0144 et al., 2018; Jastrz\u0119bski et al., 2021). The talcose rocks formation during the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif was under lower-pressure amphibolite facies conditions, i.e., during a nearly terminal stage of the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif evolution, is supported by the presence of the talc-tremolite-anthophyllite assemblage in the talcose rocks. The talc-tremolite-anthophyllite assemblage forms at low pressure (<0.2 GPa), mid-amphibolite facies (Boskabadi et al., 2017, and references therein). In addition, the presence of talc-tremolite-anthophyllite assemblage and related low pressure mid-amphibolite facies conditions of the talcose rocks formation, are similar to those reported for the Kletno deposit in the \u015anie\u017cnik Massif, also situated in the Central Sudetes (Gil et al., 2020b).\nTalcose rocks inherited Mg (24.27\u201327.21\u00a0wt% MgO), Cr (2121.0\u20132148.4\u00a0ppm), Ni (1079\u20131561\u00a0ppm) and Co (57.4\u201384.8\u00a0ppm) from serpentinites (34.16\u201334.21\u00a0wt% MgO, 2271.6\u20132292.1\u00a0ppm Cr, 1682\u20131891\u00a0ppm Ni, 81.9\u201389.5\u00a0ppm Co) as high contents of these elements are typical of serpentinite-derived metasomatites (Table 2; Figs. 6 and 9\n). Similarly, Fe (5.06\u20135.12\u00a0wt% Fe2O3) of the talcose rocks is inherited from serpentinites (6.75\u20137.14\u00a0wt% Fe2O3; Fig. 9D), which is also typical of the serpentinite-derived rocks. However, a high Fe content is not necessary caused by inheritance from host-serpentinites as proven for some dolomite-related nephrites, which can contain even more Fe derived by fluids (Siqin et al., 2012; Gil et al., 2015a). Silica, calcium and fluorine contents of the talcose rocks (57.30\u201360.46\u00a0wt% SiO2, 0.86\u20134.39\u00a0wt% CaO, 197\u2013337\u00a0ppm F) are much higher than those of serpentinites (43.38\u201344.33\u00a0wt% SiO2, 0.04\u20130.58\u00a0wt% CaO, 40\u201399\u00a0ppm F), which suggests a possible added fluid component, likely originating from the migmatitic paragneiss (67.77\u201377.39\u00a0wt% SiO2, 1.43\u20132.18\u00a0wt% CaO, 231\u2013286\u00a0ppm F) and granitic pegmatite (62.28\u00a0wt% SiO2, 5.07\u00a0wt% CaO; 78\u00a0ppm F; Table 2; Fig. 9A and C). Although amphibolitized eclogite may also serve as Ca (8.84\u00a0wt% CaO) or F (184\u00a0ppm F) source, it is unlikely a silica source due to a SiO2 content (52.99\u00a0wt%) lower than in the talcose rocks.\nThe titanium content of the talcose rocks (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0wt% TiO2) is only slightly higher than the content of serpentinites (<0.01\u20130.02\u00a0wt% TiO2) with an overlap (Fig. 9E), suggesting Ti derivation from paragneiss (0.49\u20130.65\u00a0wt% TiO2) or pegmatite (0.04\u00a0wt% TiO2), which contain slightly more Ti, rather than derivation from amphibolitized eclogite having two orders of magnitute more Ti (1.85\u00a0wt% TiO2). A fluid-driven titanium mobility can be enhanced by a high F content of the fluid, increasing Ti mobility up to 100 times relative to a pure water (Rapp et al., 2010), which is probable in the case of Gil\u00f3w due to the F content of the talcose rocks, being the highest among the examined rocks. Consequently, differences in the Ti content between the talcose rocks and serpentinites are not so high to require such Ti-enriched fluid-source as amphibolitized eclogite, as well as eclogite was unlikely the source of Si as discussed above. However, the slightly higher Ti content of the talcose rocks than that of serpentinites can be due to a relative concentration of fairly immobile Ti, caused by removing of more mobile elements, i.e., the talc layer can be a metasomatic front where immobile elements get concentrated.\nAn aluminum content of the talcose rocks (1.38\u20133.04\u00a0wt% Al2O3,) is also higher than the content of serpentinites (1.18\u20131.56\u00a0wt% Al2O3), although there is an overlap (Fig. 9B). This elevated content can be related with a metasomatic derivation from paragneiss (11.06\u201316.24\u00a0wt% Al2O3), pegmatite (23.23\u00a0wt% Al2O3) or amphibolite (16.55\u00a0wt% Al2O3), although the Al derivation from amphibolite is ruled out by a principal component analysis (PCA) for major oxides (Fig. 10\n), evidencing a mass transfer between serpentinites, and country migmatitic paragneiss and granitic pegmatite, as well as uninvolvement of amphibolitized eclogite. However, similarly as in the case of Ti, the Al content of the talcose rocks may be relatively increased due to a removal of more mobile elements. The aluminum content of most talcose rocks is only slightly elevated relative to serpentinites, but it should be stressed out that the talcose rocks are separated from serpentinites by the chlorite schist, composed predominantly of penninite, containing 12.55\u201313.16\u00a0wt% Al2O3 (Appendix 2), which likely buffered a majority of Al carried by fluids. Thus, the chlorite schist is the core of the metasomatic front, concentrating immobile elements.\nThe talcose rocks are characterized by low REE contents (\u03a3REE 2.13\u201313.81\u00a0ppm; 1 to 10 times chondritic), slightly negative sloped LREE and MREE patterns, and a flat HREE pattern. The talcose rocks are also LREE\/HREE enriched and show no distinctive anomalies in the patterns. The talcose rocks REE patterns show similarities to the patterns of all the examined wall rocks, with the exception of amphibolitized eclogite. The latter has a MORB-like, flat REE pattern (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a0111.77\u00a0ppm). The LREE\/HREE enrichment and flat HREE pattern, characterizing the talcose rocks, are present also in serpentinites, which have, moreover, similar REE content (\u03a3REE 5.49\u20137.30\u00a0ppm). However, one of the studied serpentinites has positive Eu anomaly, which is atypical for the examined talcose rocks (Fig. 8A). The REE patterns of the talcose rocks show similarities also with those of migmatitic paragneisses (\u03a3REE 137.41\u2013161.49\u00a0ppm) and granitic pegmatite (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a032.07\u00a0ppm) despite differences in a total REE content. Paragneiss and pegmatite patterns have slightly negative LREE and MREE slopes and are LREE\/HREE enriched, similar as the talcose rocks. Notably, the REE patterns of the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w are also similar to the REE pattern of the talcose rock from the Kletno deposit (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a03.13\u00a0ppm), except of a slightly negative Eu anomaly in the sample from Kletno (Gil et al., 2020b), supporting a similar formation mechanism.\nSimilar as the REE patterns, trace element patterns of the talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w show pronounced, common features with the trace elements patterns of all the wall rocks, except amphibolized eclogite. The trace elements patterns of the talcose rocks are characterized by a negative Sr anomaly (common with serpentinite and migmatitic paragneiss patterns), negative Ti anomaly (common with serpentinite, paragneiss and granitic pegmatite patterns), positive Nb-La slope (common with paragneiss and pegmatite patterns), and positive Zr-Hf-Sm slope (common with pegmatite pattern) (Fig. 8B). The only similarities between the trace elements patterns of the talcose rocks and amphibolitized eclogite are the negative Ti anomaly and positive Nb-La slope, although these features are present also in the remaining wall rocks, and the former is less pronounced in amphibolitized eclogite than in all the remaining lithologies. A fluid, responsible for serpentinites transformation into the talcose rocks, derivation from felsic rocks (paragneiss and granitic pegmatite) is similar to that documented in the case of the dolomite-hosted Sinatengr\u00fcn, G\u00f6pfersgr\u00fcn and Thiersheim I deposits, where fluids were related with the Variscan Fichtelgebirge granite pluton (Dill and Kolb, 2019). Notably, the above mentioned talc deposits in Germany are also located in the Central European Variscan belt, moreover, similarly to the Gil\u00f3w deposit, are related with the Saxothuringian Zone, although with its border with the Moldanubian Zone (Dill et al., 2008b; Dill and Kolb, 2019).\nIn the Gil\u00f3w deposit, the transition from pseudomorphic serpentinites, through non-pseudomorphic serpentinites, towards the talcose rocks, is associated with a continuous increase of \u03b418O and \u03b4D values, and decrease of a Cl content and \u03b437Cl value (Table 3; Figs. 11 and 12\n\n), which is likely caused by an increasing fluid\/rock ratio. The observed trend is similar to that in the Western Alps where the serpentinite \u03b418O values increase, and \u03b437Cl values decrease, towards the contact with metasediments (Barnes et al., 2014). However, in the Western Alps, the \u03b4D values of serpentinites decrease towards the contact with metasediments (Barnes et al., 2014), which is in contradiction to the trend obserbed in Gil\u00f3w. In Gil\u00f3w, an oxygen isotope composition of pseudomorphic serpentinite (\u03b418O value = +5.7\u2030) falls in the range of typical values of abyssal serpentinites (\u03b418O value \u2248 +1.0\u2030 to\u00a0+6.0\u2030; Wenner and Taylor, 1973; Barnes et al., 2009), whereas the non-pseudomorphic serpentinite has a higher \u03b418O value = +7.1\u2030, which may reflect interaction with crustal fluids \u2013 likely granite- or sedimentary-derived \u2013 related with the talcose rocks (\u03b418O values = +8.3\u2030 to\u00a0+8.7\u2030; Fig. 11A) formation. The fluid\/rock interaction results in \u03b4D values shift from \u221264\u2030 in the case of pseudomorphic serpentinite, to \u221248\u2030 in non-pseudomorphic serpentinite, and \u221252\u2030 to \u221248\u2030 in the talcose rocks (Figs. 11B and 12B). There is no correlation between the \u03b4D values trend of serpentinites and talcose rocks from Gil\u00f3w, and the \u03b4D values of amphibolitized eclogite and migmatitic paragneiss from the same deposit; the latter two \u03b4D values being similar each other (Fig. 12B).\nPseudomorphic serpentinite has the highest structurally-bound chlorine content and \u03b437Cl value (30\u00a0ppm Cl, \u03b437Cl value = +2.0\u2030) among the analyzed rocks except of migmatitic paragneiss. Most of Cl in pseudomorphic serpentinite is incorporated in serpentine (up to 0.02\u00a0wt% Cl; Appendix 7) as expected for metaperidotites subjected to the seafloor metamorphism. The structurally-bound chlorine content and \u03b437Cl value decrease to 21\u00a0ppm and \u22120.1\u2030, respectively, in non-pseudomorphic serpentinite (Table 3; Figs. 11C and 12A). Noteworthy, most of Cl in non-pseudomorphic serpentinite is not incorporated in serpentine (Cl is below, or near to the detection limit; Appendix 7), but in apatite-(Cl) (0.24\u20130.31\u00a0wt% Cl; Appendix 6), documented only in this type of serpentinite. Apatite in non-pseudomorphic serpentinite is even more Cl-rich than apatite in granitic pegmatite (0.04\u20130.09\u00a0wt% Cl; Appendix 6), which can be explained by an incorporation of Cl from dehydrating serpentines during apatite growth under elevated temperatute conditions, similar as documented for apatite-(Cl) from granitic pegmatite hosted in serpentinites of the Szklary Massif (the Central-Sudetic Ophiolite member), bordering the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif from the east (Szuszkiewicz et al., 2018). A structurally-bound chlorine content and \u03b437Cl value drop continues to 3\u201312\u00a0ppm, and \u22122.6\u2030 to \u22120.1\u2030, respectively, in the case of the talcose rocks. High Cl contents and positive \u03b437Cl values are typical of abyssal serpentinites and high-temperature altered (gabbroic) oceanic crust (Barnes and Sharp, 2006; Barnes et al., 2008, 2009; Barnes and Cisneros, 2012), and their ophiolitic equivalents (Barnes et al., 2006), due to alteration by seawater-derived fluids. In contrast, metasediments of marine origin often have negative \u03b437Cl values (Selverstone and Sharp, 2013; Barnes et al., 2019). Low-T marine metasediments contain\u00a0\u223c100\u2013500\u00a0ppm Cl, although the Cl content decreases with an increasing temperature of metamorphism, to \u2248 5\u201340\u00a0ppm when amphibolite or eclogite facies conditions were reached (Selverstone and Sharp, 2013; Barnes et al., 2019), i.e., the metamorphic conditions recorded by the wall rocks in Gil\u00f3w. The chlorine content (32\u201337\u00a0ppm) and isotopic ratio (\u03b437Cl values span \u22121.0\u2030 to\u00a0+0.1\u2030) of migmatitic paragneiss from the Gil\u00f3w deposit is consistent with this overal trend. In addition, a granitic pegmatite chlorine geochemistry (24\u00a0ppm Cl, \u03b437Cl value\u00a0=\u00a00.0\u2030) is similar to that of migmatitic paragneiss (Fig. 11C). A low \u03b437Cl value of granitic pegmatite is consistent with known Cl isotope ratios of felsic igneous rocks (i.e., rhyolites), which \u03b437Cl values are shifted towards more negative values relative to associated mafic and intermediate intrusives due to magmatic brines assimilation (Ranta et al., 2021). Summing up, in the talcose rocks, interaction of pristine Cl, incorporated in serpentinites, with Cl carried by fluids, derived from migmatitic paragneisses and granitic pegmatite magmas, may explain negative to near-zero \u03b437Cl values. Of note, the pegmatite \u03b437Cl value in the range of migmatitic paragneiss values may be related also with the origin of pegmatitic melts, being interpreted as resulting from partial melting of the country paragneisses (Timmermann et al., 2000; Turniak et al., 2015; W\u0142odek et al., 2015), although more Cl isotope studies of granitic pegmatites are needed to verify this thesis.\nA high-temperature altered, mafic, oceanic crust is usually Cl-rich and is characterized by positive \u03b437Cl values due to a positive Cl isotope fractionation between amphibole and seawater (Barnes and Cisneros, 2012). However, amphibolitized eclogite from Gil\u00f3w is poor in structurally-bound chlorine (18\u00a0ppm) and has a negative \u03b437Cl value (\u22120.5\u2030). A low Cl content is likely an effect of Cl removal associated with a dehydration of the mafic protolith, caused by a subduction to eclogite facies depths. Furthermore, the negative \u03b437Cl value of amphibolitized eclogite may reflect a Cl introduction, to almost anhydrous eclogite, by crustal fluids during retrogression under amphibolite facies conditions. This hypothesis is supported by ferro-hornblende and ferro-tschermakite, forming rims around ilmenite and the rims of zoned amphiboles, the Cl content of 0.03\u20130.04\u00a0wt% (Appendix 3), contrasting with Cl below the detection limit of other phases (including the cores of zoned amphibole grains). Hence, an eclogite retrogression may be linked with an interaction with the same fluids as serpentinites transformation into the talcose rocks, which fluids were derived from migmatitic paragneisses and granitic pegmatites (Fig. 11C).\nThe above listed geochronological, geochemical and isotopic features point to the formation of the talcose rocks from the Gil\u00f3w deposit in a way of serpentinite replacement under the influence of fluids, derived from migmatitic paragneisses and intruding granitic pegmatites (felsic source). This contrasts with the origin of the talcose rocks in the seafloor setting, which formed in the way of a serpentinite interaction with fluids related with mafic rocks (Boschi et al., 2006a; Barnes et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA quality of talcose rocks from the Gil\u00f3w deposit in the G\u00f3ry Sowie Massif allows their usage as a carving material and in ceramics, although the presence of tremolite and anthophyllite in the ore, as well as high Cr and Ni contents of the talcose rocks, preclude its utilization in the pharmacy and cosmetics industry. Gil\u00f3w is a serpentinite-hosted talc deposit. More detailed, it belongs to the talc deposits formed at the margins of serpentinite bodies due to a contact metasomatism with more siliceous rocks. Moreover, the Gil\u00f3w deposit belongs to the thrust-bound and fold-related metamorphogenic deposits, and classifies as the thrust-bound talc and asbestos deposits in (ultra)basic igneous rocks type of Dill et al. (2008a).\nThe Gil\u00f3w deposit formation is related with the Variscan metallogenic event (Variscan metallogenic province). On the basis of the Th-U-total Pb chemical dating of monazite from the chlorite schist, the upper age limit of the talcose rocks formation is constrained to 389.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4\u00a0Ma, whereas the lower limit to 365.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2\u00a0Ma. The older date likely reflects the serpentinites juxtaposition with country paragneiss and chorite formation (Fig. 13\n). The younger date, overlapping ages of the amphibolite facies, country paragneiss migmatitization, and intrusions of granites and granitic pegmatites (\u223c380\u2013370\u00a0Ma), probably reflects a progressive recrystallization of chlorite into amphiboles and talc. The talcose rocks from the Gil\u00f3w deposit inherited MgO (24.27\u201327.21\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (5.06\u20135.12\u00a0wt%), Cr (2121.0\u20132148.4\u00a0ppm), Ni (1079\u20131561\u00a0ppm) and Co (57.4\u201384.8\u00a0ppm) from serpentinites, which are slightly more abundant in these compounds. In contrast, SiO2 (57.30\u201360.46\u00a0wt%), CaO (0.86\u20134.39\u00a0wt%), Al2O3 (1.38\u20133.04\u00a0wt%), TiO2 (0.02\u20130.04\u00a0wt%) and F (197\u2013337\u00a0ppm) contents in the talcose rocks are higher than in the host-serpentinites, reflecting a metasomatic introduction by fluids, likely derived from country migmatitic paragneisses or granitic pegmatites. An introduction of these elements from migmatitic paragneiss and granitic pegmatite is evidenced by the a negative \u03b437Cl value of the talcose rocks, and elevated \u03b418O values of the talcose rocks relative to those of serpentinites. Rare Earth Elements and trace elements patterns of the talcose rocks show a LREE\/HREE enrichment, positive Nb-La and Zr-Hf-Sm slopes, and negative Sr and Ti anomalies \u2013 features similar to migmatitic paragneiss and granitic pegmatite patterns.\nA formation of the talcose rocks at the expense of serpentinite lenses involved several metasomatic stages linked with a progressive increase of a \u03b418O value, as well as a progressive decrease of a Cl content, and \u03b4D and \u03b437Cl values, caused by fluids derived from country migmatitic paragneiss and granitic pegmatite (Fig. 13). Pseudomorphic serpentinite, similar to abyssal serpentinites (\u03b418O value = +5.7\u2030, \u03b4D value\u00a0=\u00a0\u221264\u2030, \u03b437Cl value = +2.0\u2030), recrystallized into non-pseudomorphic serpentinite (\u03b418O value = +7.1\u2030, \u03b4D value\u00a0=\u00a0\u221248\u2030, \u03b437Cl value\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.1\u2030), which, in turn, was transformed into the talcose rock (\u03b418O values span\u00a0+8.3\u2030 to\u00a0+8.7\u2030, \u03b4D values \u221252\u2030 to \u221248\u2030, \u03b437Cl values \u22122.6\u2030 to \u22120.1\u2030). Moreover, migmatitic paragneiss- and granitic pegmatite-derived fluids likely affected also eclogite bodies during a retrogression under amphibolite facies conditions (Fig. 13) as evidenced by a negative \u03b437Cl value (\u22120.5\u2030) and most of amphibolite's Cl incorporation in amphibole rims.\n\n","20":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nChina has emerged as the leading producer of gold in the world (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014; Deng and Wang, 2016). The Jiaodong gold province is known in the world for its giant gold resources (over 5000 tones, Fig. 1\n\nFan et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2020). The gold deposits of Jiaodong have been the topic of various studies including the nature, source, enrichment mechanism, and holistic genetic model (Zhai et al., 2004; Fan et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005; Mao et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2015, 2020; Zhu et al., 2015; Li and Santosh, 2017; Groves and Santosh, 2021). In spite of a large number of investigations, the genesis of the Jiaodong gold province remains debated, and it is difficult to fit the gold deposits in the Jiaodong gold province into current classic metallogenic models. Diverse models have been proposed, such as anorogenic gold deposits (Zhai et al., 2004), decratonic gold deposits (Zhu et al., 2015), Jiaodong-type gold deposits (Deng et al., 2015, 2020; Li et al., 2015) and orogenic gold deposit (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015, Groves and Santosh, 2016; Groves et al., 2020). At present, due to the strong correspondence between the Jiaodong gold mineralization and the peak of the destruction of the North China Craton (NCC), several workers advocate the model of decartonization of the NCC. The NCC was assembled from several Archean mircroblocks with initial cratonization at ca. 2.5\u00a0Ga and the final assembly of the continental blocks by 1.85\u00a0Ga (Zhai and Santosh, 2011; Gao et al., 2021). After a prolonged period of quiescence, the craton experienced extensive reactivation and destruction during the Mesozoic (Xu, 2001; Wu et al., 2005, 2021c; Zhu et al.,2012; Yang and Santosh, 2020; Yang et al., 2021). The peak period of NCC destruction is the Early Cretaceous is considered to have triggered the large-scale gold mineralization in the Jiaodong region along the NE part of the craton (Fig. 1). Most workers believe that mineralization is related to the devolatilization of enriched and metasomatized mantle sources (Yang and Santosh, 2020; Groves et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020; Zhu and Sun, 2021). However, the diverse models and debates surrounding the origin of the gold deposits in this region indicate that their formation involved more complex processes than previously recognized. Ore-forming fluid is the most dominant factor in hydrothermal mineralization (Peterson and Mavrogenes 2014; Mills et al. 2015; Tanner et al., 2016), and their nature, origin, composition, migration, and changes are important in understanding the leaching, migration, precipitation, and enrichment of ores. The characteristics of ore-forming fluid can be directly reflected by the fluid inclusions captured in minerals associated with the ore mineralization, especially quartz and calcite, in addition to the various hydrothermal minerals in the alteration of surrounding rocks (Fan et al., 2005; Li et al., 2018). Recent new techniques of in situ microanalytical experiments allow us to trace the metallogenic evolution on a more fine scale (Feng et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021).\nThe Jiaojia-Xincheng fault belt controls many super-large gold deposits, such as the Jiaojia, Xincheng, Sizhuang, Shaling, and Qianchen gold deposits, and the adjacent Sanshandao-Cangshang fault belt also controls many super- large gold deposits, such as Sanshandao, Xinli, Cangshang, Xiling, and Haiyu gold deposits, and the gold resources occupy more than two-thirds of the Jiaodong gold province (Fan et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2018). In the Sanshandao gold belt, Wen et al. (2016) studied the character of ore-forming fluid (0\u00a0m to \u22122000\u00a0m) based on the fluid inclusions and considered that the ore-forming fluid has a uniform evolutionary process and a more consistent mineralization temperature and salinity. For the Jiaojia gold belt, due to the restrictions of prospecting and exploration project, previous studies concentrated on the shallow (0\u00a0m to \u2212600\u00a0m) mineralization and fluid characteristics (Lu et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2021). The exploration and prospecting work at depth in the Jiaojia gold belt (\u2212600\u00a0m to \u22122000\u00a0m) has been recently completed, although the geological characteristics, mineralization, and metallogenic regularity in the depth remain uninterpreted due to lack of systematic work. In the Jiaojia gold belt, the Qianchen gold deposit (depth up to \u22122000\u00a0m) is the deepest deposit and is therefore an ideal window to explore the deep fluid characteristics and determine the origin and evolution in the gold deposit of the Jiaojia-Xincheng belt. It is also significant to make a comparative study of the two important metallogenic belts from deep to shallow domains that would provide insights into the Jiaodong gold mineralization.\nIn this study, we focused on the deep drilling samples (\u22121100\u00a0m to \u22121800\u00a0m) of the Qianchen gold deposit at the southern part of the Jiaojia gold belt. After a detailed field and petrological study, fresh and representative samples were selected for laboratory analysis. We applied a variety of experimental methods, mainly including a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), microthermometric measurements (THMS 600), RM-2000 laser Raman probe, LA-MC-ICP-MS, and other equipment. Here we present detailed mineralogical, fluid inclusion, elemental and isotopic composition of pyrite, and primary halo geochemical data for the deep ore body of the Qianchen gold deposit. We also synthesize data from previous studies in this area for comparison and discussion. Based on these, we evaluate the characteristics and evolution of deep and shallow ore\u2011forming fluids, intending to address the sources of ore-forming materials and fluids, to probe the genesis, and establish comprehensive metallogenic models. We also evaluate the resource potential of deep ore bodies and establish a primary halo model. Our multiproxy investigation from the Qianchen gold deposit provides insights into the fluid and mineralization of the Jiaodong gold province and the decratonization of the NCC.\n\n\n2\nGeologic background\nThe Jiaodong world-class gold district is located to the east of the Tanlu fault and along the south-eastern margin of the NCC (Fig. 1). The Jiaodong Peninsula is divided into the Sulu ultra-high pressure metamorphic belt and the Jiaobei Terrane by the Yantai\u2013Wulian fault (Zhou et al. 2008). The Jiaobei Terrane consists of the southern Jiaolai Basin and the northern Jiaobei Uplift. Precambrian metamorphic basements are mainly exposed in the Jiaobei Uplift and include the Archean metamorphic rocks and the Paleoproterozoic rocks together with volcanic and intrusive rocks (Zhai and Santosh, 2013).\nMesozoic granitoids are widely distributed in the Jiaodong Peninsula (Fig. 1). The Late Jurassic granitoid is mainly composed of syncollisional granitoids and calc-alkaline granitoids, which are thought to have formed from the remelting of the thickened lower crust at \u223c160\u00a0Ma (Yang et al., 2012), and are represented by the Linglong granite (in the west) and Kunyushan granitoids (in the east). In the Early Cretaceous, lower crustal melt mixed with mantle components to form high K calc-alkaline granites (130\u2013126\u00a0Ma, Jiang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2012) and are represented by the Guojialing, Sanshandao, Congjia, Beijie, and Shangzhuang examples. Subsequently, alkali granites (120\u2013110\u00a0Ma) and mafic dikes (121\u201387\u00a0Ma) were formed by melting of the ancient crust (Li et al., 2019) and upwelling of the lithospheric mantle, respectively (Ma et al., 2014).\nThe Jiaodong gold province has been divided into three gold belts, which are the Muping-Rushan gold belt, Penglai-Qixia gold belt, and Zhaoyuan-Laizhou gold belt from east to west (Fan et al. 2007). These gold belts are mainly controlled by NE-NNE-striking fault zones, such as Zhaoyuan-Pingdu, Jiaojia-Xincheng, and Sanshandao-Cangshang fault zones (Fig. 1). The Qianchen gold deposit occurs in Zhaoyuan-Laizhou gold belt and is controlled by the Jiaojia-Xincheng fault zone (Figs. 1 and 2\n). The Jiaojia-Xincheng fault zone is NE-striking and NW-dipping, and a series of gold deposits are developed together with the secondary faults such as the Wangershan fault zone, with a total gold resource of about 1300 tons (Yang et al., 2017). The Jiaojia gold belt is mainly exposed to Archean metamorphic rock, late Jurassic Linglong granite, and early Cretaceous Guojialing Granodiorite.\n\n\n3\nOre deposit geology\n\n3.1\nMineralization and alteration\nThe Qianchen gold deposit is a large gold deposit (>50\u00a0t of Au) located in the southern part of the Jiaojia gold belt. Ore-hosting elevation of the Qianchen gold deposit is mostly \u22121000 to \u22121800\u00a0m. The gold deposits occur mainly in the Linglong granite and Archean metamorphic rocks (Fig. 3\n), locally accompanied by lamprophyre and diorite porphyrite. There are over 34 gold ore bodies, which are often veined and show the characteristics of pinch and swell, with Au grade showing a range of 0.05\u00a0g\/t to 16.68\u00a0g\/t with an average of 2.45\u00a0g\/t. The ore body attitude is consistent with the main fracture surface, dipping towards the west to northwest at an angle of 4\u25e6\u223c47\u25e6. Gold deposits in the Jiaodong gold province can be divided into fracture-altered rock type and sulfide-bearing quartz vein type, and many of the Qianchen gold deposit belong to the fracture-altered rock type mineralization. The Qianchen gold deposit can be divided into three mineralization stages based on a cross-cutting relationship in the field and mineral paragenesis characteristics. Early stage (quartz-pyrite-gold): pyrite is mainly formed during this stage, with a high degree of crystallization and generally coarse grains, mostly in the form of euhedral agglomerates and disseminations, which is the main ore-forming stage of gold. Middle stage (quartz-polymetallic sulfide-gold): the sulfide grains are fine, and most of them are euhedral to subhedral granular, and some are anhedral granular, which is the main ore-forming stage of gold. The sulfide is mainly pyrite, often accompanied by chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. Native gold and silver are filled along pyrite and quartz fissures. There is also a small number of gold inclusions and interstitial gold. Late stage (quartz-calcite): most of the quartz is gray-white, and occurs in the form of quartz veinlets\/quartz-calcite veins.\nWall rock alteration in the Qianchen gold deposit is pervasive and is dominated by potassic alteration, silicification, beresitization, and phyllic alteration. The alteration phenomenon shows an obvious symmetry (Fig. 3), with the ore body as the center, and the alteration degree getting weakened. Most ore bodies are of altered rock type. Each prospecting profile often includes multiple alteration zones, such as phyllic plagioamphibolite, beresitization granite, pyllic metagabbro cataclasite, beresitization granite cataclasite, and beresitization cataclasite.\n\n\n3.2\nMineralogy\nPyrite is the most important sulfide and occurs in all the mineralization stages, which is also an important gold-bearing mineral. Natural gold in the Qianchen gold deposit is very common (2\u2013180\u00a0\u03bcm) (Figs. 4\n, 6a). Gold grains under reflected light or the BSE image show very bright features, and often appear as inclusions or occur in fissures (Fig. 4). Other metallic minerals include chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, magnetite, wulfenite and galenobismuthite (Fig. 5\n\n). There are also rare platinum group minerals, mainly hexaferrum, which contain Os and Ir (Figs. 5a and 6b). Non-metallic minerals mainly quartz, sericite, feldspar, and so on. As accessory minerals, monazite, zircon, barite, etc. can be observed. Except for pyrite and quartz, other minerals are relatively small in size.\n\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical techniques\nThree representative drill hole samples were selected for this study namely 340ZK4, 368ZK2, and 376ZK10 (Figs. 3 and 4). Selective sampling was carried out for different experiments and purposes. For the fluid inclusion analyses, we carefully identified the crosscut relationships and genetic associations between different ore veins and selected the early, middle, and late stage quartz veins. For the in-situ trace element and sulfur isotopic analysis of pyrite, samples from \u22121100\u00a0m to \u22121200\u00a0m and \u22121400\u00a0m to \u22121500\u00a0m zones were selected from drill holes 340ZK4 and 368ZK2 respectively. For the whole-rock analyses, we selected the deepest drill hole 376ZK10 for sampling, the elevation from \u22121600\u00a0m to \u22121800\u00a0m.\n\n4.1\nMineral microanalysis\nWe carried out detailed mineralogic and petrographic analyses of the representative the samples from Qianchen gold deposit. Detailed mineral identification was carried out using the Phenom XL scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS), Beijing, China, which is equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Backscattered electron (BSE) images were acquired with an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV and beam current 3 or 4\u00a0nA in the SEM user interface. The collection time of each BSE image is 1\u00a0min and the semi-quantitative point analyses lasted 30\u00a0s.\n\n\n4.2\nFluid inclusion analyses\nDoubly polished plates of around 0.2\u00a0mm thickness were prepared for mineralogical and fluid inclusion studies, and representative inclusions were selected for microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy. Samples from quartz veins of three stages all carry fluid inclusion assemblages (FIAs) suitable for microthermometry and laser Raman spectra. Primary, secondary, and pseudo-secondary fluid inclusions were distinguished using the criteria of Van den Kerkhof and Hein (2001). All descriptions follow the FIAs (Wilkinson, 2001).\nMicrothermometric measurements on fluid inclusions were carried out at the IGGCAS, using a THMS 600 programmable heating\/freezing stage and equipped with Carl Zeiss Axioskop 40 and Nikon transmission\/reflection optical microscope\u00a0+\u00a0camera (photography) system, which can directly observe the continuous change of phase state of fluid inclusions during heating or freezing. The stage was calibrated by calibrating the critical point of water (374.1\u00a0\u00b0C), the freezing point of water (0\u00a0\u00b0C), and the triple-point of pure CO2 (\u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C) using synthetic fluid inclusions provided by Fluid INC. The measuring accuracy of the freezing and heating table is \u00b10.5\u00a0\u2103, \u00b10.2\u00a0\u2103, and \u00b12\u00a0\u2103 respectively in the temperature range of \u2212120\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u221270\u00a0\u2103, \u221270\u00a0\u223c\u00a0100\u00a0\u2103, and 100\u00a0\u223c\u00a0500\u00a0\u2103. In the process of temperature measurement, the heating rate is controlled at 0.2\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u00a0\u2103\/min. The heating rate of CO2-containing inclusions decreases to 0.2\u00a0\u2103\/min near phase transition temperature (such as solid CO2 melting and CO2 clathrate melting), and 0.2\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.5\u00a0\u2103\/min near freezing point and homogenization temperature of H2O \u2013 NaCl inclusions (Fan et al., 2003). The fluid inclusions (mole fraction), salinity, CO2 density, and total density were calculated by MacFLINCOR (Brown and Hagemann, 1995), and the Steele-Macinnis (2012) formula was used to calculate the pressure.\nThe compositions of single fluid inclusions were identified by the RM-2000 laser Raman probe produced by the Renishaw company in Britain at the IGGCAS. The Ar\u00a0+\u00a0laser was used with a wavelength of 532\u00a0nm, and the counting time of the measured light spectrum was 10\u00a0s, counting every 1\u00a0cm\u22121 (wavenumber), and the peak was taken in the whole band of 100\u00a0\u223c\u00a04000\u00a0cm\u22121. The laser beam spot size was about 1\u00a0\u00b5m, and the spectral resolution was 2\u00a0cm\u22121 for the minerals and gas phases (e.g., CO2 and CH4) (Liu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021a).\n\n\n4.3\n\nIn-situ trace element analysis of pyrite\nElement in situ analysis of pyrite was conducted using LA-ICP-MS at the Wuhan Sample Solution Analytical Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. The detailed operating conditions and data reduction for laser ablation systems and ICP-MS instruments are the same as described by Zong et al. (2017). Laser sampling was performed by the GeolasPro laser ablation system, which consists of a MicroLas optical system and a COMPexPro 102 ArF excimer laser (maximum energy of 200\u00a0mJ and wavelength of 193\u00a0nm). And we used Agilent 7700e ICP-MS to acquire ion signal intensities. Helium is the carrier gas and argon is the supplementary gas, and the two are mixed before entering ICP. The laser ablation system also included A \u201cwire\u201d signal smoothing device (Hu et al., 2015). The spot frequency and size of the laser were set to 5\u00a0Hz and 32\u00a0\u00b5m, respectively. Trace element compositions of pyrite were calibrated by NIST 610. Meanwhile, MASS-1 (USGS) was used as an unknown sample to verify the accuracy of the calibration method. Each analysis consisted of approximately 20 to 30\u00a0s of background collection followed by 50\u00a0s of sample data collection. The background and analysis signals were selected and integrated offline with excel based ICPMSDataCal software, and time drifts correction and quantitative calibration were carried out for trace element analysis (Liu et al., 2008).\n\n\n4.4\n\nIn-situ S isotope analysis of pyrite\n\nIn-situ S isotope analysis of pyrite was measured using Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS (Made in Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), which equipped a Geolas HD excimer ArF laser ablation system (Made in Coherent, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) at the Wuhan Sample Solution Analytical Technology Co., Ltd, Hubei, China. We used helium as a carrier gas for the laser ablation system. To avoid the Down Hole fractionation effect of sulfur isotope ratio in the analytical process (Fu et al. 2016), a large beam spot (44\u00a0\u03bcm) and a low frequency (2\u00a0Hz) laser conditions were selected, and about 100 laser pulses were denuded in a single analysis. At the same time, a signal smoothing device is equipped (Hu et al. 2015) to ensure stable signals under slow frequency conditions. The laser energy density is fixed at 5.0\u00a0J\/cm2. Equipped with nine Faraday cups and 1011 \u03a9 resistance amplifiers, the Neptune Plus uses L3, C, and H3 Faraday cups for simultaneous static reception of 32S, 33S, and 34S signals. The high-performance Jet\u00a0+\u00a0X cone combination is used to improve signal strength. Nitrogen (4\u00a0mL\/min) is introduced into the plasma to reduce polyatomic ion interference. Medium-resolution modes (about 5000) are adopted. Pyrite was corrected with pyrite standard PPP-1 and the reference values of \u03b434Sv-CDT have been described by Fu et al. (2016). All the analyzed data were processed by professional isotope data processing software \u201cISO-Compass\u201d (Zhang et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.5\nWhole-rock element analyses\nWe collected fresh samples from deep drill cores of the ore body for whole-rock geochemical analyses using an atomic fluorescence spectrometer, X-fluorescence spectrometer, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at the laboratory of Shandong Sixth Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploration. For the specific experimental method, refer to Li et al. (2016, 2018). The main elements analyzed are Au, Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sn, W, Zn, As, Sb, Bi, and Hg. Element correlation analyses were carried out on the measured data, using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software (Templ et al., 2008; Zuo et al., 2013; Reimann et al., 2017).\nData processing and element zoning was calculated based on Harraz and Hamdy (2015), Wu et al. (2021b), and Li et al. (2016, 2020) as follows:\n\n(1)\nMetal concentration (M) was defined by M\u00a0=\u00a0Cx\u00a0\u2212\u00a0C0. Where C0 is the element mean background concentration and Cx is the measured element content. And element contrast or anomaly was calculated by the measured elemental concentration of the Qianchen gold deposit divided by the background concentration.\n\n\n(2)\nAll the M were standardized (Bi) for each element anomaly by Bi\u00a0=\u00a010aMi, where i and a are positive integers.\n\n\n(3)\nThe enrichment coefficient Ki of each element at each elevation was calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\ni\n\n=\n\n\nB\ni\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nm\n\n\nB\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\nAccurately calculate the sequence of elements in the same middle section with the same concentration center. For the uppermost or lowermost intercept elements, the concentration coefficient variation index (H) is used to measure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\nK\n\nmax\n\n\n\nK\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\nThe zone sequence was first preliminarily identified according to the concentration coefficient variation index. If H is large, that indicates the upward migration of these elements. And if H is small, that indicates the variation index in the sequence is in the lower part level.\n\n\n(6)\nFor elements in the middle part, variation difference of concentration coefficient (\u25b3H) is used to measure the difference of concentration trend: \u25b3H\u00a0=\u00a0Hupper-Hlower. The larger the difference value is, the greater the tendency of downward aggregation of this element is, and the more it should be ranked behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nFluid inclusions\n\n5.1.1\nPetrography and types of fluid inclusions\nThe fluid inclusions in the Qianchen gold deposit are small in volume and difficult to observe. A total of 140 fluid inclusions were analyzed. According to the phase and state characteristics of fluid inclusions at room temperature and laser Raman composition analysis, the fluid inclusions in the Qianchen gold deposit can be divided into three types (Fig. 7\n): (1) H2O\u2013NaCl (type I), (2) H2O\u2013CO2\u2013NaCl (type II), (3) CO2 (type III). The petrographic characteristics of each type of fluid inclusions are described below.\nThe main composition of type I inclusions is H2O (Fig. 7a, b), including mono-phase (LH2O) and two-phase (VH2O + LH2O) forms. It is the main type of inclusion in the Qianchen gold deposit, accounting for 50% of the total number of inclusions. According to the ratio of vapor to liquid, these inclusions can be divided into liquid-rich inclusion and vapor-rich inclusion. The liquid-rich inclusions have a vapor\u2013liquid ratio of 8\u00a0\u223c\u00a030% at room temperature, with sizes ranging from 3\u00a0\u223c\u00a07\u00a0\u03bcm. The vapor\u2013liquid ratio of vapor-rich inclusions is usually >60% at room temperature, and the size ranges from 3\u00a0\u03bcm to 8\u00a0\u03bcm. Type I inclusions occur in clusters and small amounts of isolated quartz veins at various stages of mineralization.\nType II inclusions are mainly composed of H2O and CO2 (Fig. 7c), and are important fluid inclusions in the Qianche gold deposit, accounting for 35% of the total number of inclusions. At room temperature, it mainly exists in the form of liquid-rich two-phase (VCO2+ LCO2\u00a0+\u00a0LH2O), with a small amount of three inclusion (VCO2\u00a0+\u00a0LCO2\u00a0+\u00a0LH2O). The vapor phase typically accounts for 10% to 75% of the total inclusion volume. This type of inclusion is small (2\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm), usually oval, plate-like, long strip, isolated or distributed in groups in various stages of mineral quartz veins.\nType III inclusions are mainly composed of CO2 (Fig. 7d), containing almost no water and containing single-phase pure CO2 or vapor\u2013liquid two-phase CO2 (VCO2\u00a0+\u00a0LCO2) at room temperature. The inclusions are small (4\u20138\u00a0\u03bcm), dark in color, and elliptic in shape. Most of these inclusions are isolated in quartz sulfide veins at \u22121100\u00a0m elevation, accounting for 15% of the total number of inclusions.\n\n\n5.1.2\nFluid inclusion microthermometry\nFluid inclusion microthermometry was carried out only on the primary fluid inclusions to avoid possible post mineralization effects on the mineralization environment. Individual clusters with similar phase ratios in intragranular quartz crystals are interpreted as primary in origin and considered to be analogs to FIAs suitable for further study. Large variations in the homogenization temperatures among the fluid inclusions that are spatially close together, though they can\u2019t be assigned to an FIA, are considered to be indications of heterogeneous stretching, trapping, or necking (Chi and Lu, 2008; Chi et al., 2021) and were not included in our analyses. A total of 134 sets of data were obtained through detailed microthermometric measurements of various fluid inclusions in representative samples at different ore-forming stages of the Qianchen gold deposit. The results are shown in Table 1\n, Table S1, and Fig. 9\n\n, as described below.\nThe quartz in the early stage of mineralization is mainly composed of H2O\u2013NaCl type (type I) and H2O\u2013CO2\u2013NaCl type (type II) inclusions. Type I inclusions yielded ice-melting temperatures ranging from \u221212.1\u00a0\u00b0C to \u22124.5\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to the salinities of 7.73\u201316.05\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent. The homogenization temperatures for type I inclusions were 218 to 351\u00a0\u00b0C, the estimated trapping pressures 20.47\u2013158.89 bars, and the total fluid densities 0.71\u20130.96\u00a0g\/cm3. After the type II inclusions were completely frozen, the first phase transition occurs into the melting of solid CO2 (Tm,CO2) with temperatures ranging from \u221257.1 to \u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C, which indicates the presence of other gases such as CH4. Next, the melting temperature of the clathrate (Tm,clath) was 3.9 to 7.5\u00a0\u00b0C and the corresponding salinity is in the range of 4.8\u201310.62\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. The homogenization temperatures of the CO2 phase are in the range of 16\u201328.1\u00a0\u00b0C, the final homogenization temperatures range from 287 to 358\u00a0\u00b0C, and the carbon phase density (\u03c1CO2) and total inclusions density (\u03c1) calculated are 0.65\u20130.81\u00a0g\/cm3 and 0.89\u20130.98\u00a0g\/cm3 respectively.\nA large number of primary fluid inclusions were captured in the quartz during the main ore-forming period, and the abundances in decreasing order are as follows: H2O\u2013NaCl type (type I), H2O\u2013CO2\u2013NaCl type (type II), and CO2 type (type III) inclusions. Type I inclusions yielded ice-melting temperatures ranging from \u22129\u00a0\u00b0C to \u22122.1\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to the salinities of 3.55\u201312.85\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent. The homogenization temperatures for type I inclusions are in the range of 201 to 312\u00a0\u00b0C, with estimated trapping pressures of 15\u201397.55 bars, and total fluid densities of 0.74\u20130.93\u00a0g\/cm3. After the type II inclusions were completely frozen, the first phase transition occurs into the melting of solid CO2 (Tm,CO2) with a temperature range from \u221257.3 to \u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C (which contains other gases such as CH4 or N2). Next, the melting temperature of the clathrate (Tm,clath) was 5.6 to 9.2\u00a0\u00b0C and the corresponding salinity was 1.61\u20138.03\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. The homogenization temperatures of the CO2 phase are 17.1\u201330.8\u00a0\u00b0C, the final homogenization temperatures range from 242 to 289\u00a0\u00b0C, and the carbon phase density (\u03c1CO2) and total inclusions density (\u03c1) calculated are 0.54\u20130.80\u00a0g\/cm3 and 0.82\u20130.99\u00a0g\/cm3 respectively. The initial-melting temperatures (Tm,CO2) of type III inclusions are \u221257.2 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a056.6\u00a0\u00b0C, the homogenization temperatures of the CO2 are 13.2\u201327.9\u00a0\u00b0C, and the fluid densities are 0.66\u20130.84\u00a0g\/cm3.\nIn the late mineralization stage, the major inclusion type is H2O\u2013NaCl type (type I), including mono-phasic H2O type and two-phase H2O type inclusions. Type I inclusions yielded lower ice-melting temperatures ranging from \u22129\u00a0\u00b0C to \u22120.5\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to the salinities of 0.88\u201312.85\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent. The homogenization temperatures for type I inclusions are 92 to 252\u00a0\u00b0C, the estimated trapping pressures 0.74\u201337.69 bars, and the total fluid densities 0.87\u20130.99\u00a0g\/cm3.\n\n\n5.1.3\nRaman spectroscopic results\nA confocal laser Raman spectrometer was used to analyze the composition of representative fluid inclusions. In addition to the characteristic peak of host mineral quartz, the CO2 characteristic peak and broad liquid H2O peak appeared on the Raman spectrum (Fig. 8). The number of CO2-containing inclusions accounted for about 40%, and very few inclusions contained CH4. The type I inclusions of the Qianchen gold deposit have obvious CO2 spectrum peaks, and the Type II inclusions are mainly composed of CO2 and H2O in the vapor phase and H2O in a liquid phase. Type III inclusions are mainly H2O.\n\n\n\n5.2\nTrace element compositions of pyrite\n\nIn situ trace elements of two elevation intervals (\u22121100\u00a0m to \u22121200\u00a0m and \u22121400\u00a0m to \u22121500\u00a0m) of pyrite analyzed by LA-ICP-MS are listed in Table S2 and displayed in Fig. 10\n. Evaluation of this data focused on significant trace elements in the pyrite samples from two elevations and the elements include Au, Ag, As, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Mo, Sn, W, Sb, Bi, Ti, and Cr.\nFor \u22121100\u00a0m to \u22121200\u00a0m elevation pyrite samples, the content of Au ranges from 0.002 to 0.088\u00a0ppm (av. 0.028\u00a0ppm). Pyrite at this elevation has higher As (9.46 to 341\u00a0ppm, av. 160\u00a0ppm), and Ti (1.47 to 2.77\u00a0ppm, av. 2.16\u00a0ppm). Silver, Co, Ni, Mo, Sn, W, Ba and Cr have a relatively concentrated content range, from 0.016 to 1.05\u00a0ppm (av. 0.337\u00a0ppm), from 1.51 to 86.9\u00a0ppm (av. 20.4\u00a0ppm), from 0.98 to 30.3\u00a0ppm (av. 11.0\u00a0ppm), from 0.0061 to 0.07\u00a0ppm (av. 0.0234\u00a0ppm), from 0.04 to 0.2\u00a0ppm (av. 0.101\u00a0ppm), from 0.0029 to 0.017\u00a0ppm (av. 0.0093\u00a0ppm), 0.0004 to 0.49\u00a0ppm (av. 0.1479\u00a0ppm) and from 0.075 to 1.55\u00a0ppm (av. 0.74\u00a0ppm), respectively. Copper, Zn, Pb, Sb, and Bi have a relatively dispersed content range, from 0.069 to 18.8\u00a0ppm (av. 3.27\u00a0ppm), from 0.48 to 9.41\u00a0ppm (av. 1.68\u00a0ppm), from 0.38 to 23.5\u00a0ppm (av. 6.47\u00a0ppm), from 0.0008 to 0.42\u00a0ppm (av. 0.188\u00a0ppm), from 0.28 to 10.2\u00a0ppm (av. 3.5\u00a0ppm), respectively.\nFor \u22121400\u00a0m to \u22121500\u00a0m elevation pyrite samples, the content of Au ranges from 0.0002 to 0.31\u00a0ppm (av. 0.053\u00a0ppm). Pyrite at this elevation has higher Ni (5.43 to 659\u00a0ppm, av. 112\u00a0ppm), W (0.0038 to 0.12\u00a0ppm, av. 0.0302\u00a0ppm) and Cr (0.23 to 2.93\u00a0ppm, av. 1.0\u00a0ppm). Silver, Mo, Sb and Ba have a relatively concentrated content range, from 0.034 to 1.53\u00a0ppm (av. 0.478\u00a0ppm), from 0.0041 to 0.057\u00a0ppm (av. 0.0218\u00a0ppm), from 0.021 to 0.36\u00a0ppm (av. 0.11\u00a0ppm) and from 0.0063 to 0.63\u00a0ppm (av. 0.1102\u00a0ppm), respectively. Arsenic, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Sn, Ti and Bi have a relatively dispersed content range, from 0.04 to 70.4\u00a0ppm (av. 32.2\u00a0ppm), from 0.0012 to 38.4\u00a0ppm (av. 25.9\u00a0ppm), from 0.045 to 16.7\u00a0ppm (av. 3.0\u00a0ppm), from 0.53 to 121\u00a0ppm (av. 13.0\u00a0ppm), from 0.012 to 42.9\u00a0ppm (av. 10.0\u00a0ppm), from 0.0011 to 0.32\u00a0ppm (av. 0.15\u00a0ppm), from 1.96 to 2.95\u00a0ppm (av. 2.38\u00a0ppm), from 0.0002 to 23.6\u00a0ppm (av. 6.0\u00a0ppm), respectively.\n\n\n5.3\nSulfur isotopic compositions of pyrite\nThe sulfur isotopic compositions of pyrite samples from the two elevation intervals (-1100\u00a0m to \u22121200\u00a0m and \u22121400\u00a0m to \u22121500\u00a0m) measured by La-MC-ICP-MS are presented in Table S3 and Fig. 11\n. The sulfur isotopic data show a slight difference between the two elevation pyrite. The pyrite at \u22121100 to \u22121200\u00a0m elevation has positive ranges of sulfur isotopic compositions, extending from 10.55 to 12.6\u2030. The pyrite at \u22121400 to \u22121500\u00a0m elevation represents relatively small \u03b434S values and ranges from 12.57 to 13.76\u2030.\n\n\n5.4\nPrimary halo geochemistry\nThe whole-rock geochemistry results of the sample at \u22121600\u2013-1800\u00a0m are listed in Table S4 and Fig. 15. We collected samples of mineralized altered wall-rock and two ore-veins respectively, as shown in Fig. 3c, which display significant differences in elements from high to low. In the ore body (-1718\u00a0m and \u22121768\u00a0m), the content of ore-forming elements shows an obvious increase (Fig. 16).\nThe correlation analysis of elements is an effective method to understand the affinity of each element by using the correlation coefficient between elements. Based on the theory of primary halo and previous experience (Li et al., 2016, 2020), 12 elements were chosen for correlation analysis, which are Au, Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Sn, W, As, Sb, Bi, and Hg. The correlation coefficient matrix of different elements are listed in Table 2\n. The elements that are positively correlated with Au are Sb\u00a0>\u00a0As\u00a0>\u00a0Bi\u00a0>\u00a0W\u00a0>\u00a0Ag\u00a0>\u00a0Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Mo\u00a0>\u00a0Hg\u00a0>\u00a0Sn.\nThe elemental abundance of the upper crust of the North China Craton (Yan et al., 1997) was used as the background value to calculate the contrast value (element anomaly). The calculated results of the contrast value of different elements at different elevations are listed in Table 3\n. The concentration center method was used to calculate the vertical zoning of the element related to Au. The concentration coefficient results are shown in Table 4\n, and the vertical zoning sequence is Hg-Zn-Au-Cu-As-Pb- Sb-W-Bi-Ag-Sn-Mo.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nCharacteristics and evolution of deep ore\u2011forming fluids\nPrevious studies have shown that ore-forming fluids in the Jiaodong gold deposits are comparable and dominated by H2O-NaCl-CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4 fluids with low-mediate temperature (200\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity (0\u201310\u00a0wt% NaCl eq.) (Fan et al., 2003; Wen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021). The Jiaojia-Xincheng fault belt and the Sanshandao-Cangshang fault belt are the two most important gold metallogenic belts of the Jiaodong gold province. Wen et al. (2016) studied the character of the ore-forming fluid (0\u00a0m to \u22122000\u00a0m) of the Sanshaodao gold belt and indicated that the ore-forming fluid is basically consistent from deep to shallow domain and that the Jiaodong gold province has a uniform fluid evolutionary process. However, previous studies focused on shallow ore bodies (\u2212100\u00a0m to \u2212600\u00a0m) of the Jiaojia gold belt (Hu et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2011), and indicated that the fuild characteristics between the Jiaojia gold belt and the Sanshaodao gold belt are similar. After the study of the deep deposit (the Qianchen gold deposit) in the Jiaojia gold belt, we have arrived at some general conclusions ad summarized below.\nThe ore\u2011forming fluid of the Qianchen gold deposit is characterized by low-media temperature and low salinity. The data of the three types of fluids inclusions obtained in the experiment are projected onto the homogenization temperatures -salinity map (Fig. 9). It can be seen that the temperature of ore-forming fluid gradually decreased from the early stage to the late stage, and the salinity decreased slightly from the early stage to the main ore-forming stage and significantly decreased from the evolution to the late stage of ore-forming (Fig. 9). It can be inferred that cooling and decompression are important factors of metal precipitation, and the late mixing of meteoric water resulted in a decrease in salinity. In terms of fluid composition (Fig. 8), the fluid inclusions of the Qianchen gold deposit are mainly H2O\u2013NaCl (type I) and H2O\u2013CO2\u2013NaCl (type II) with small volumes (mainly 4\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm). The type I inclusions occur from the early stage to the late stage. A large number of type II inclusions occur in the main mineralization stage, while type I inclusions dominate in the late stage. The co-existence of type I and type II fluid inclusions in quartz co-precipitated with natural gold and pyrite sulfides has been observed in the Qianchen gold deposit (Fig. 7k). The homogenization temperature is similar, indicating different compositions of the H2O-CO2 fluid phase (fluid immiscibility) involved in the precipitation process of gold and pyrite. Cooling can induce destabilization of metal complexes in ore-forming fluids and facilitate fluid immiscibility, resulting in the precipitation of gold. CH4 exists in a small number of inclusions of the Qianchen gold deposit. CH4 in hydrothermal fluids generally comes from three possible sources: (1) water\u2013rock interaction (Berndt et al., 1996; Cao et al., 2014; Potter et al., 1998, 2004); (2) mantle source (Abrajano et al., 1988; Kendrick et al., 2011); (3) biological source (Des-Marais et al., 1988; Ueno et al., 2006). As there are no sedimentary strata containing organic materials, biological sources are excluded. In addition, CH4 is almost nonexistent in fluid inclusions below 3000\u00a0m of the Sanshandao gold deposit (Wen et al., 2016), which indicates that mantle source is unlikely. We consider that the gold deposits in Sanshandao and Jiaojia may have similar initial fluid sources, thus the most likely source of methane is the reaction of hornblende, ilmenite, and plagioclase in the wall rock with fluid to form sphene, hydrogen, and actinite, and hydrogen further reduces CO2 to CH4 (Wen et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2021). Distinct types of fluid inclusions but similar homogeneous temperatures were found in the same growth zones of quartz from the Qianchen gold deposits (Fig. 7k), suggesting fluid immiscibility. In the process of immiscibility, CH4 and other reducing gases enter the gas phase, and the relative increase of SO4\n2- in the fluid leads to the relative oxidation of the residual fluid. At the same time, due to immiscibility, local oxidation occurs in the fluid, forming a small amount of SO4\n2- and combining with Ba2+ in the solution to form barite, resulting in the coexistence of barite and pyrite (Fig. 5i). The evolution trend is similar to those considered in previous studies on most gold deposits of the Jiaodong gold province, but the overall temperature is low and salinity varies widely.\nVertical projection analysis of the homogenization temperature and salinity of the deep inclusions in the Qianchen gold deposit show a certain pattern (Fig. 12\n). The elevations of the collected samples are \u22121100\u00a0m to 1200\u00a0m and \u22121400\u00a0m to 1500\u00a0m, and their vertical changes are slightly different. From the deep to the shallow, the salinity range becomes larger in the late stage, and the salinity increases slightly, while the temperature has little change trend. Compared with the characteristics of the gold deposits in the Sanshandao gold belt (Wen et al., 2016) and the shallow gold deposits in the Jiaojia gold belt (Hu et al., 2021), the temperature of the Jiaojia gold belt is slightly higher than that of Sanshandao gold belt in the shallower part, while the temperature range of deep part is similar (from the characteristic of the Qianchen gold deposit). Concerning salinity, from shallow to deep, the gold deposits in Jiaojia and Sanshandao belts show broadly similar ranges and trends, and the salinity increases and the range becomes larger gradually. As the fluid moved upward, the pressure changed, and variations in pressure would influence the phase separation and fluid density (Chen et al., 2021c; Hu et al., 2021). The phase separation plays a vital role in elemental partitioning during the evolution of fluid chemistry (Ulrich et al., 2002; Klemm et al., 2007, 2008; Landtwing et al., 2010), and can lead to fluid immiscibility. There is also a slight change in salinity (Fig. 9b and 12), and salinity decreases with depth and temperature, often as a result of meteoric water mixing. Taken together, we believe that the Jiaodong gold province has a unified ore-forming fluid system. The Sanshandao gold belt and the Jiaojia gold belt have similar properties of ore-forming fluids, which are dominated by H2O-NaCl-CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4 with the characteristics of low-medium temperature and low salinity. Metal precipitation was caused by decompression, cooling, phase separation, fluid mixing, and fluid-rock interaction. Fluid immiscibility was an important mechanism of mineralization.\n\n\n6.2\nEvaluation of pyrite signature from two elevations\nFrom \u22121100\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22121200\u00a0m to \u22121400\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22121500\u00a0m, the variation characteristics of pyrite\u2019s trace elements in the two orebodies of the Qianchen gold deposit show that there is little change in element content in general, but there are some differences in some elements, such as As, Ni, Ti, W, Bi, Pb, which can reflect the changes in the properties of ore-forming fluids and the precipitation and enrichment of ore-forming elements with shallower depths and lower temperatures (Fig. 10). Pyrite is prevalent in most hydrothermal systems, and the precipitation of pyrite can effectively control the distribution of a large number of trace elements of economic and environmental importance, such as Au, Ag, As, and heavy metals (Deditius et al., 2008; Large et al., 2009). Numerous studies have shown that they can occur as structurally bound elements (i.e. solid solutions) or as micro- to nano-mineral inclusions (Cline, 2001; Palenik et al., 2004; Reich et al., 2005; Deditius et al., 2009, 2011). Gold deposits are generally well correlated with As and Cu, and microscopic observation shows that pyrite is usually accompanied by chalcopyrite, and natural gold, electrum, and other minerals are often found in the mineralized parts with more pyrite and chalcopyrite. Previous studies proposed that in the reducing environment, As in pyrite replaces S in the structure of pyrite in the form of anion As1\u2212, while in the relatively oxidized and shallow system, As can appear in pyrite in the form of As3+ (Simon et al., 1999; Cline, 2001; Emsbo et al., 2003; Reich et al., 2005; Deditius et al., 2008, 2009, 2011). From deep to shallow, the metallogenic environment will change to a certain extent, resulting in changes in redox conditions. As shown in Figs. 10\u00a0and\u00a013\na and g different linear changes are observed in As. Fig. 13a, b, and d show a positive correlation between Au and As and Ag in the elevation of \u22121400\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22121500\u00a0m, but there is no obvious linear correlation between Au and As and Ag in the elevation of \u22121100\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22121200\u00a0m. In the Au vs. As diagram (Fig. 13a), all the plots fall below the Au saturation line, which suggests that gold may be undersaturated in the ore-forming fluids (Reich et al., 2005). There are several examples of gold occurring as lattice-bound metal besides native gold (Sun et al., 2022). In addition, the content of Ag is low (<1); therefore there are no independent sliver minerals, and silver enters into the lattice of pyrite (Cook et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2022). However, Fig. 13d reflects that in the two elevation samples, both Au and Cu have a good positive correlation, and the results of scanning electron microscopy show that natural gold and chalcopyrite are closely associated (Fig. 4). The slope of the shallow elevation is relatively high, which may indicate that this elevation has better mineralization. In addition, Fig. 13c shows that Zn content changes little at different elevations, while Pb content increases at shallow elevations, which indicates that the mineralization processes of the two elevations are not completely consistent. People often use the ratio of Co\/Ni and the content of Co and Ni to judge the origin of pyrite and the properties of the fluid. Usually, magmatic-hydrothermal pyrites have higher Co\/Ni ratios >1, while sedimentary diagenesis pyrites have lower ratios and high Ni concentrations (Bajwah et al., 1987; Reich et al., 2016). As can be seen from Fig. 13e and f, the ore-forming fluid of the Qianchen gold deposit might have been sourced from the mixture of metamorphic fluid and magmatic-hydrothermal fluid due to its wide range of Ni (0.98 to 659\u00a0ppm) and Co (0.0012 to 86.9\u00a0ppm) content and Co\/Ni ratio (0.00023 to 55.94), and the deep domains had more contribution from the basement components as reflected by higher Ni content and lower Co\/Ni ratio. The As\/Bi ratio (Fig. 13g) is used to judge the depth and denuded degree of the ore body (Lin, 1999; Wu et al., 2021a). Generally, the As\/Bi ratio\u00a0<\u00a02 of the drilling sample indicates the characteristics of deep ore bodies, while the As\/Bi ratio >10 reflects shallow ore bodies (Lin, 1999; Wu et al., 2021a). Thus the pyrite samples belong to the deep ore body. In addition, the ternary diagram of (Au\u00a0+\u00a0Bi\u00a0+\u00a0Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) \u2013 (As\u00a0+\u00a0Sb\u00a0+\u00a0Ag\u00a0+\u00a0Ba) \u2013 (Ti\u00a0+\u00a0Cr\u00a0+\u00a0Co\u00a0+\u00a0Ni) shown in Fig. 13h can indicate the depth of mineralization (Chen et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2013), which corresponds to the deep and shallow mineralization sites.\nThe \u03b434S of pyrite at the two elevations show some difference (Fig. 11). The \u03b434S of \u22121400\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22121500\u00a0m pyrite is low (8.09\u00a0\u223c\u00a011.05\u2030), while the \u03b434S of \u22121100\u00a0\u223c\u00a01200\u00a0m pyrite is high (10.55\u00a0\u223c\u00a012.6\u2030). The corresponding trace elements and S isotope diagrams (Fig. 14\n\n\n) are also different. The sulfur isotope is generally heavy, which is consistent with the sulfur isotope characteristics of the whole Jiaodong gold province. The metallogenic temperature of the Qianchen gold deposit is relatively low (<350\u00a0\u00b0C); therefore SO4\n2- and H2S are the most important sulfur species under a low-temperature equilibrium system (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Chen et al., 2021b). In a hydrothermal metallogenic system, sulfur isotope fractionation rarely occurs during the production of pyrite from H2S (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Chen et al., 2021b). Therefore, the properties of ore-forming fluids changed during the mineralization process at these two elevations, but overall it is generally consistent. The fluid-rock interaction could lead to the increase of \u03b434S (Fan et al., 2021), and the phenomenon of hydrothermal fluids leaching ore-forming materials from wall rocks has been widely observed in Carlin-type gold deposits (Large et al., 2011). The changes in temperature and pressure conditions and oxygen fugacity during the migration of ore-forming fluid will affect the fluid properties. Evidence from fluid inclusion shows that the mixing of other sources and immiscibility of fluid are important factors. The S isotope value of the shallow gold deposit (300\u00a0M) in the Jiaojia gold district is in the range of 8\u00a0\u223c\u00a013\u2030 (Mills et al., 2015), which is basically consistent with the S of the deep pyrite, reflecting the unified homology of ore-forming fluids. The metallogenic belt of the Sanshandao fault and the Jiaojia fault is distributed parallel, and there are certain differences in the sources of minerals and fluids. The S isotope values of the Jiaojia-Sanshandao gold deposit range from 1.9 to 13\u2030 (Fig. 11b, Mao et al., 2008; Deng et al., 2015; Mills et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017), and the S isotope values of gold deposits in Sanshandao belt are smaller. The gold deposits in the Jiaodong Peninsula are mainly hosted in the Guojialing granite, Linglong granite, and Jiaodong Group metamorphic rocks. The \u03b434S values of the Linglong granite range from 6.1 to 10.1\u2030 (Yang, 1998). The Guojialing granite shows a broader S isotopic range, from 2.7 to 10\u2030 (Li et al., 1993). The metamorphic rocks of the Jiaodong group and Jinshan group have a more concentrated range, from 7.2 to 7.6\u2030 and 5.6 to 9.8\u2030, respectively. Combined with the trace element characteristics (most of them appear as magmatic source pyrite) and sulfur isotopic characteristics (a more concentrated distribution) of pyrite, the ore-forming fluids of the Qianchen gold deposit are inferred to be mainly magmatic hydrothermal fluids, and mixing with a minor volume of metamorphic fluids, suggesting that the regional magmatic rocks and metamorphic rocks both contributed to the source.\n\n\n6.3\nPrimary halo model and prospecting potential\nThe primary geochemical halo of an ore deposit was defined by Safronov (1936) as a region including enriched ore-formation and associated elements in hydrothermal mineralization, which are commonly used to detect the hidden and deep mineralization (Gundobin, 1984; Goldberg et al., 2003; Filzmoser et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016), especially hydrothermal gold deposits have a very good effect (Li et al., 1999, 2013a, 2020). The axial zoning of the primary halo in an ore deposit is linked to the direction of fluid flow and provides information about the presence of deep ore bodies (Beus and Grigorian, 1977; Li et al., 2006, 2016; Zuo et al., 2009). Whether it is concentration zoning or component zoning, the core of the discrimination is to effectively determine the regionalization boundaries between each zoning (Li et al., 1999, 2006, 2013a). Therefore, it is necessary to determine the component boundaries of the relevant trace elements in the study area through combined feature analysis. To provide a reliable classification basis and lower limit value for subsequent prospecting and prediction problems. Correlation analysis is to consider two or more variable elements with correlation, to understand the relationship between variable elements. Gold has a positive correlation with Ag, Cu, Mo, Sn, W, As, Sb, Bi, and Hg elements, and a negative correlation with Pb and Zn. The formation of minerals such as galena and sphalerite may have consumed a certain amount of the component, with a little competition with the formation of gold. Previous studies have concluded that the characteristics of the near-ore halo, supra-ore halo, and sub-ore halo of hydrothermal deposits indicate the commonness of element combination, and summarized the ideal axial zoning sequence of primary halos of hydrothermal gold and non-ferrous metal deposits (Li et al., 1999, 2013a). The upper or outer part of an ore body is generally rich in As-Hg-Sb-F-Ba-B, the main ore body, and their central part often rich in Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn, and for the sub-ore halo or the lower part of an ore body is rich in Mo-Bi-W-Mn-Ti-Ni-Co. Gold is the most direct and important indicator element for the formation of gold orebodies, while Ag is an important associated element. Arsenic, Sb, and Hg are indicative elements of the supra-ore halo characteristics of gold deposits. Under the condition of Au anomalies, the occurrence of strong As, Sb, and Hg anomalies indicates the existence of blind ore in the deep. The strong anomalies of Cu, Pb, and Zn reflect the superposition of stage II, which may form rich orebodies. Bismuth and Mo are sub-ore halo indicator elements. The occurrence of strong anomalies of Bi and Mo indicates the tail of the ore body. However, when the strong anomalies of Bi and Mo coexist with the strong anomalies of As, Sb, and Hg indicator elements, it indicates that there is a large downward extension of the ore body or blind ore body in the deep.\nThe vertical zonation (Hg-Zn-Au- Cu-As-Pb- Sb-W-Bi-Ag-Sn-Mo) of ore-forming elements calculated by the concentration-centered method can reflect the variation law of elements from top to bottom and from alteration to orebody and then to alteration zone, which basically accords with the characteristics of element zonation. The study on the enrichment intensity of metallogenic elements was carried out on the \u22121715\u00a0m ore body (Fig. 16), and it was found that this part of the ore body was enriched with both the low-temperature elements of the supra-ore halo and the high-temperature elements of the sub-ore halo, so this part may be the superposition of the supra-ore halo and sub-ore halo. A mineralization prediction and primary halo model (Fig. 17\n) show that the ore body in the study section (\u22121700\u00a0m to \u22121800\u00a0m) is a superposition of mineralization, the Qianchen deposit has great mineralization and a promising prospecting potential.\n\n\n6.4\nComprehensive metallogenic model\nThe age of the Jiaodong gold deposit ranges from 130\u00a0Ma to 100\u00a0Ma and erupted at 120\u00a0Ma (Yang and Zhou, 2001; Fan et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Deng et al., 2020), corresponding to the peak period of the NCC destruction. Since the Early Cretaceous, the subduction and continuous roll-back of the Paleo-Pacific plate caused a strong extension in eastern North China, constituting the major tectonic framework of the Jiaodong gold mineralization (Fan et al., 2003, 2005; Deng et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021; Zhu et al. 2015; Zhu and sun 2021). Based on the previous studies, a comprehensive metallogenic model is proposed (Fig. 18\n). The Jiaojia-Xincheng fault belt controls the medium to super large gold deposits, such as Jiaojia, Xincheng, Sizhuang, Shaling, and Qianchen gold deposits, and the Sanshandao-Cangshang fault belt controls the large to super large gold deposits, such as Sanshandao, Xinli, Cangshang, Xiling, and Haiyu gold deposits, this gold resources occupy more than two-thirds of the Jiaodong gold province (Fan et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2018). The sulfur isotope values of the Qianchen gold deposit are generally high, which is consistent with the sulfur isotope characteristics of the Jiaodong gold province. The sulfur isotope composition of the sulfide in the Jiaodong gold deposit is basically consistent with the occurrence of main-granite and associated rock-lamprophyre. On the one hand, it indicates that the ore-forming fluid of the Jiaodong gold deposit might be the magmatic-hydrothermal source. On the other hand, the sulfur in the Jiaodong gold deposit was inherited from its host rock or source rock, and the ore-forming fluid might have strongly interacted with the surrounding rock. Previous studies proposed that mantle fluid and crust-mantle interaction play an important role in the formation of the Jiaodong gold deposit based on C\u2013H-O-S-Pb-He-Ar isotope evidence (Deng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2005). Wang et al. (2022)believed that the metasomatic lithospheric mantle underwent large-scale melting, forming mantle-derived volatile magma, although the magma may not have been abnormally enriched Au, but could effectively extract and further enrich Au in the metasomatic lithospheric mantle. The presence of unusual platinum group element minerals (mainly consisting of Os and Ir) might also indicate the mantle material contribution (Fig. 6b). The Au-bearing hydrous magma derived from the partial melting of the metasomatized sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), underwent magmatic-hydrothermal differentiation and fluid exsolution, and the Au was enriched and partitioned into exsolved fluids that evolved to auriferous fluids (Wang et al., 2018, 2019, 2022).\nIn the fluid evolution process, there are many efficient gold precipitation mechanisms, such as sulfidation, fluid immiscibility, fluid reduction, and Au-As coupling substitution (Fan et al., 2003; Li et al., 2013b; Wang et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021). The Qianchen gold deposit shows obvious fluid immiscibility. Au(HS)2\n- is the main migration form of gold in the ore-forming fluid under medium acidic and low temperature conditions (Stef\u00e1nsson and Seward, 2004), the loss of H2S in ore-forming fluids (through sulfide or fluid immiscibility) can not only rapidly reduce the solubility of gold, but also control the evolution of metal sulfide and oxide assemblages. The evolution of mantle-derived magma can release medium and low salinity CO2-H2O-rich fluids (Ridley and Diamond, 2000). CO2 can regulate the PH of the fluid to keep it within the stability range of gold-sulfur complexes, thereby increasing the solubility of gold (Phillips and Evans, 2004). In addition, CO2 can accelerate the formation of the gas phase, and its boiling can lead to the decrease of PCO2 and the increase of pH in the residual liquid phase, thus destabilizing the gold-sulfur complex and gold precipitation (Lowenstern, 2001). In the process of its upward migration, the ore-forming fluid inevitably reacts with the surrounding rock, thus forming various alterations such as potassic alteration, silicification, sericitization, phyllic alteration, and beresitization. The constant addition of late fluids from different sources and mixing with the initial fluids and concurring fluid-rock interaction lead to significant changes in the properties of the fluids, thus showing a small difference in the trace elements and sulfur isotopes of pyrite. The significant fluid activities, multiple sources of Au in the mantle and ancient basement, and the large fault structures promoted the formation of the giant Jiaodong gold province.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nOur study leads to the following main conclusions.\n\n(1)\nNatural gold is the most important form of Au, and the accompanying PGE minerals hint at contributions from mantle material in the Jiaojia gold belt.\n\n\n(2)\nThe primary ore-forming fluids of the Qianchen gold deposit are characterized by medium\u2013low temperatures and salinities, and abundant CO2, the change has little to do with depth. Metal precipitation was caused by decompression, cooling, phase separation, fluid mixing, and fluid-rock interaction. And fluid immiscibility is an important mechanism of mineralization.\n\n\n(3)\nThe characteristics of trace elements and S isotopes of pyrite at different elevations reflect changes in fluid properties, which can be affected by ore-forming conditions (temperature, pressure, and oxygen fugacity), fluid-rock interaction, and continue mixing of the metamorphic-hydrothermal and meteoric fluids.\n\n\n(4)\nThe Jiaodong gold province has a unified ore-forming fluid system. The Sanshandao gold belt and the Jiaojia gold belt have similar properties of ore-forming fluids, but there are slight differences between each deposit.\n\n\n(5)\nPrimary halo model shows that the studied ore body (\u22121700\u00a0m to \u22121800\u00a0m) is a superposition of mineralization and that the Qianchen deposit has great potential for prospecting.\n\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Jiangnan Orogen, with estimated total gold resources of \u223c970\u00a0t, is the most important gold province in South China (Xu et al., 2017a). Gold deposits in the orogen are mostly hosted by Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks, and were developed around major NE-trending faults and their secondary WNW-trending structures (Niu and Ma, 1991; Mao and Li, 1997; Gu et al., 2012). Despite decades of research, the regional gold metallogenesis is still unclear, and various ore deposit models have been proposed, including orogenic, epithermal, intrusion-related, and intracontinental reactivation (Mao and Li, 1997; Peng and Frei, 2004; Gu et al., 2007, 2012; Dong et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2013; Deng and Wang, 2015; Ni et al., 2015; Zhu and Peng, 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). A key dispute lies in the mineralization age, which has been variably suggested as Neoproterozoic, Early Paleozoic, and Late Mesozoic (Luo, 1990; Hu et al., 1995; Mao and Li, 1997; Gu et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2008; Han et al., 2010; Ni et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020a). Another uncertainty is about the ore-material source, which have been interpreted to be low-grade metamorphic sedimentary rocks, mantle, intrusions, or connate seawater (Luo, 1990; Niu and Ma, 1991; Ma and Liu, 1992; Mao et al., 2002; Xiao et al., 2002; Peng et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2021). The Mesozoic was an important Au metallogenic epoch in the Jiangnan Orogen. The Au mineralization is spatially associated with granitic intrusive bodies (Xu et al., 2017a and references there in), and fluid inclusion and H\u2013O\u2013C\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopic data also indicate that the ore forming materials were derived directly from the granitic magma (and possibly also from metamorphic units) (Xu et al., 2017a and references therein). Therefore, gold deposits in the Jiangnan Orogen vary greatly in terms of their age, ore-forming material source, and potential magmatic\/metamorphic metallogenetic link, which have resulted in the many ore deposit models proposed.\nA number of geochronological studies also have been carried out on the Au deposits in northeastern (NE) Hunan, yielding a wide age range from ca. 460 to 70\u00a0Ma (Mao and Li, 1997; Dong et al., 2008; Han et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021a, Zhou et al., 2021b). However, most of these studies were based on Rb\u2013Sr dating on fluid inclusions extracted from quartz veins, which commonly show relatively large errors. Further geochronology using robust methods on minerals with suitable compositions is required to provide robust ages of the Au mineralization events. 40Ar\/39Ar method has become one of the most robust methods in dating of hydrothermal ore deposits (Phillips et al., 2012; Fairmaid et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019b). Recently, Deng et al. (2017) obtained the muscovite Ar-Ar plateau age (130.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma) from the Dayan prospect at the Wangu Au deposit, suggesting an Early Cretaceous Au metallogenic event. Ore-forming materials at Wangu may have sourced from the meta-sedimentary ore host, with possible contribution from the Late Mesozoic granites and mantle (Deng et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2020). Sun et al. (2020) reported muscovite Ar-Ar age (\u223c220\u00a0Ma) from the Zhengchong Au deposit in NE Hunan, suggesting an older Late Triassic Au metallogenic event. Ore-forming materials at Zhengchong were possibly sourced from the metamorphosed Lengjiaxi Group sedimentary rocks (or deeper metasedimentary sequences), but not from granites (Liu et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020). Thus, previous studies have revealed at least two Mesozoic gold mineralization epochs in NE Hunan.\nDue to the variety of metallogenic epochs and the complexity of the sources of metallogenic materials, there are many different opinions regarding the genetic type of the Au deposits in NE Hunan. Gold deposits such as the Huangjindong and Wangu deposits do not exhibit clearly spatial links with magmatic rocks. These deposits were once believed to be telethermal deposits, syn-magmatic epithermal-mesothermal deposits (Xu, 1965), or syn-genetic sedimentary deposits (Meng and Xie, 1965). In recent years, studies focusing on the genesis of the NE Hunan have mainly defined these deposits as orogenic-, epithermal-, and magmatic hydrothermal-type deposits (Mao and Li, 1997; Dong et al., 2008; Goldfarb et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). In addition, by summarizing the geological, geochemical, and tectonic features of the gold (polymetallic) deposits of all periods in the northeastern Hunan Region, Xu et al. (2017a) proposed a new genetic model, i.e., the \u2018\u2018intracontinental reactivation type\u201d, to explain the genesis of these deposits (Deng et al., 2017). Though lots of studies have been done for these deposits, the ore genesis is still controversial.\nThe Lishupo gold deposit is located in the central part of the Jiangnan Orogen. For this deposit, the mineralization age, ore-fluid nature, ore-material source, and any genetic link with the granodiorite remain poorly constrained. This study aims to answer these questions through integrating petrographic, geochronologic and S\u2013Pb\u2013H\u2013O isotopic analyses of the ore-related sulfides and associated gangue minerals. H\u2013O isotopes are important tracers of the evolutionary history of the ore-forming fluids. Sulfur and Pb isotope studies provide an efficient tool for determining and tracing the origin of these components in ore deposits. Based on the systematic field work and thin section observations, we have documented the detailed ore geological characteristics and alteration\/mineralization styles. Mineralization age and granodiorite emplacement age were constrained by biotite 40Ar\u201339Ar and zircon U-Pb dating, respectively. The ore-fluid\/-material sources were determined with S\u2013Pb\u2013H\u2013O isotopic data, and these new metallogenic information are combined to investigate genetic links with magmatic rocks, and synthesize a metallogenic model for the Lishupo gold deposit.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nSouth China consists of the Yangtze Block in the northwest and the Cathaysia Block in the southeast (Fig. 1\na). The Jiangnan Orogen was formed by Neoproterozoic accretion and subsequent collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks in southern China (Fig. 1a; Shu, 2012). Spatially, the extent of the orogen is defined by the exposures of Neoproterozoic metamorphosed sedimentary and minor mafic rocks and widespread granite intrusions (Wang et al., 2017a, Wang et al., 2017b). The orogen is clearly bordered by the Jiangshan-Shaoxing (Jiangshao) Fault to the southeast, whereas its indistinct boundaries to the northwest are defined.\nNortheastern Hunan is located in the central Jiangnan Orogen (Xu et al., 2009a) (Fig. 1a). Exposed sequences in the region include the Neoproterozoic Lengjiaxi and Banxi Group (Gp.) metasedimentary rocks and Mesozoic proluvial\u2013alluvial\u2013neritic\u2013fluvial red beds. The Lengjiaxi Group is composed of low-grade metamorphosed turbidites consisting of sandy slates, silty slates, metamorphic siltstones and metagreywackes, which are uncomfortably overlain by the Banxi Group that is constituted of clastic sediments comprising sandstones, slates, phyllites, intermediate\u2013felsic tuffs, and conglomerates (Xu et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2011; Deng et al., 2017).\nThree sets of regional faults were documented in NE Hunan (NW-, EW-, and NE-\/NNE-trending). After the Early Neoproterozoic Wuling Orogeny, N\u2013S-directed compression has intensely folded the Lengjiaxi Gp. sequences (Fig. 1b). The subsequent middle Neoproterozoic Xuefeng Orogeny had formed the NW-trending faulting and folding (Xu et al., 2017a). EW-trending Early Paleozoic (Caledonian) structures include tight\/overturned folds and the accompanying ductile shear zones under a N\u2013S compressional stress regime (Deng et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017a; Zhou et al., 2021a, Zhou et al., 2021b). Geophysical data interpretation suggested that many of these EW-trending folds extend across the crust (Xu et al., 2009a; Wen et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017). In the Triassic, the Indochina-South China collision may have changed the regional stress into NW\u2013SE-directed (Chu et al., 2012; Wang and Shu, 2012), forming a series of ENE-\/NNE-trending thrust and folds (Xu et al., 2009a; Li et al., 2011), while N-S-directed compression was likely weakened but persisted. The N\u2013S compression probably stemmed from the collision of the South China Block with the North China to the north and Indochina Blocks to the southwest (Faure et al., 2014). Under the different stress regimes, a series of NE-trending fold belts were developed in NE Hunan (Xu et al., 2017a; Zhou et al., 2021a, Zhou et al., 2021b). In the Late Mesozoic, the regional stress changed again to WNW-directed, which reactivated preexisting NE-\/NW-\/E-trending faults to form a largely NNE-trending structural framework (Xu et al., 2017a). This stress regime is also compatible with the numerous NE-SW- to NNE-SSW-trending folds and thrust structures in the South China Block (Zhou et al., 2021a, Zhou et al., 2021b), which have been interpreted to be formed during the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous tectonic event (Xu et al., 2009b; Li et al., 2014).\nFour magmatic episodes in the Neoproterozoic, Early Paleozoic, Early Mesozoic, and Late Mesozoic were identified in NE Hunan (Zhou et al., 2006; Zhao and Cawood, 2012; Charvet, 2013; Shu et al., 2014, Shu et al., 2015). In the Late Neoproterozoic, mantle plume-related or backarc tectonics may have rifted South China apart to form the South China Rift Basin and extensive magmatism, including granitic plutons at Banbei, Changsanbei, Getengling, and Daweishan (Wang et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2017a; Deng et al., 2018). Intensive Early Paleozoic intracontinental orogeny may have closed the South China Rift Basin (Faure et al., 2009; Charvet et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015), forming regional high-grade metamorphism and synorogenic granites at Hongxiaqiao and Banshanpu (Li et al., 2015). Triassic intrusions are represented by the Wangxian granodiorite-porphyry (zircon U\u2013Pb age: 224.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4\u00a0Ma; Yang et al., 2018). The post-orogenic extension may have induced widespread regional granitic intrusion (Li et al., 2015). The Jurassic-Cretaceous NW-directed Paleo-Pacific subduction may have first thickened the South China crust and then extended it by slab-rollback, forming many NE-trending grabens and rift-related bimodal volcanism and granite emplacement (e.g., Lianyunshan, Zhang et al., 2008; Yi et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013, 2014).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\nThe Lishupo gold deposit is one of the latest-discovered gold deposits in NE Hunan. The Lishupo has a total resource of 4.3\u00a0t Au with an average grade of 4.76\u00a0g\/t Au (Hunan BGMR, 2019). Exposed stratigraphy at Lishupo comprises the Neoproterozoic Lengjiaxi Group, which contains the Xiaomuping and Huanghudong formations. The Xiaomuping Formation (main ore host) slate and meta-sandstone are exposed mainly in central and northwestern Lishupo. Meanwhile, the Huanghudong Formation, consisting of slate and meta-sandstone\/greywacke, is exposed mainly in southwestern Lishupo.\nMajor structures at Lishupo include NE\/EW-trending faults and WNW-trending ductile shear zones (Fig. 2\n), with the latter being developed along the slate layers with quartz veining. These quartz veins are locally lenticular and show plastic deformation. The ductile shear zones (NNE-dipping at 20\u201335\u00b0 dip angle) are 4.5\u00a0km long and 2\u20136\u00a0m wide, and control the distributions of granodiorite plutons and gold orebodies. The NE- trending faults (dip angle: 25\u201340\u00b0) are 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0km long and 4\u20138\u00a0m wide. Meanwhile, the EW-trending (south-dipping) faults in southwestern Lishupo (dip angle: 20\u201340\u00b0) are 3\u20134\u00a0km long. Magmatic rocks at Lishupo are dominated by medium-\/fine-grained granodiorite, which intruded the Lengjiaxi Group. The granodiorite contains mainly euhedral\u2013subhedral plagioclase, anhedral quartz, hornblende, and biotite, and accessory Fe-Ti oxides, titanite, apatite, and zircon.\nAt Lishupo, six gold ore veins (No. I to \u2165) were identified (Fig. 2). The gold orebodies are mainly hosted in ductile shear zones and minor along the Lengjiaxi Group- granodiorite intrusive contact (Fig. 3\n). The orebodies in the Lishupo gold deposit are centered on a series of shear zones exhibiting ductile deformation characteristics that are located mainly within sericite-chlorite slates of the Lengjiaxi Group (Fig. 4\na\u2013c). Quartz veins display lenticular structures (Fig. 4d). Microscopic-scale ductile shear zones are common, in which the main minerals are quartz, sericite and chlorite (Fig. 4f). Wallrock alteration are featured by silicification, with quartz\u2013(sulfide) veinlets, sericitization, with disseminated pyrite and quartz\u2013sericite veinlets, chloritization, with chlorite as the predominant hydrothermal mineral and carbonatization, with calcite in quartz veins (Fig. 4g-i). Gold mineralization styles at Lishupo include auriferous quartz\u2013sulfide veinlets, and dissemination in altered wallrocks (Fig. 5\na\u2013c). Metallic minerals include pyrite and arsenopyrite, and minor pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena. Non-metallic minerals include quartz, sericite, chlorite, and carbonates (dolomite and calcite). Metallic minerals occur as euhedral\u2013subhedral grains or replacement of earlier mineral phase (Fig. 5d\u2013i). Biotite occurred in the polymetallic sulfides vein (Fig. 5j-l). Trace element compositions of the pyrite and arsenopyrite from other deposits in the same region indicate the existence of invisible gold (Sun et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2022). As a result, we consider that the pyrite and arsenopyrite are the primary auriferous sulfides in the Lishupo deposit.\nBased on its vein-crosscutting relations, mineral assemblages (Fig. 6\n) and paragenesis (Fig. 7\n), the alteration and mineralization at Lishupo comprise three stages: (1) quartz (Q1)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py1)\u2013arsenopyrite stage; (2) quartz (Q2)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py2)\u2013polymetallic sulfides stage; (3) quartz (Q3)\u2013carbonate stage. In general, stage 2 is the main mineralization stage due to abundant auriferous sulfides in the quartz veins. Stage 1 veins are cut by stage 2 (main mineralization stage) quartz (Q2)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py2)\u2013polymetallic sulfide veins (Fig. 6a\u2013b), in which the sulfides include pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrrhotite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sphalerite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0galena (Fig. 6a\u2013b, d\u2013f), and non-metallic minerals include quartz, biotite, sericite, chlorite, and dolomite. Stage 1 and 2 veins are cut by stage 3 ore-barren quartz (Q3)\u2013carbonate veins with little to no sulfide minerals (Fig. 6c\u2013f).\n\n\n4\nSamples and analytical methods\n\n4.1\nSampling\nA total of 15 drill-core samples were collected from Lishupo, including all stage 1 to 3 veins. Seven representative samples for the oxygen-hydrogen isotope analyses were crushed to 40\u201380 mesh. Six auriferous pyrite samples selected for the sulfur-lead isotope analyses were milled to 200 mesh. The biotite (for Ar-Ar dating) and zircon (for U-Pb dating) samples were collected from drill-hole ZK602-9 and ZK4401-4, respectively. These samples can provide robust geological and age information.\n\n\n4.2\nBiotite 40Ar\u201339Ar dating\nBiotite sample (ZK602-9) was collected from the sulfide-bearing ores of stage 2 from ore vein \u2161 (180\u00a0m depth). Biotite grains were crushed and sieved to 40\u201380\u00a0\u03bcm, and then hand-picked under a binocular microscope to achieve\u00a0>\u00a099% purity at the China University of Geoscience (CUG Wuhan). The 40Ar\u201339Ar dating was performed at the Key Laboratory of Tectonics and Petroleum Resources of Ministry of Education (China University of Geosciences), using an ARGUS IV mass spectrometer with a mini efficient preparation system (80\u00a0mL). In the analysis, a CO2 laser (10.6\u00a0\u03bcm, 50\u00a0W) was used to heat the biotite samples, and fluid inclusions were extracted with a crusher and an air reservoir (31 L) and pipette (0.1\u00a0mL). The ARGUS IV collector has five faraday cups, of which the H2, H1, Ax, L1 and L2 were used measure the 40Ar, 39Ar, 38Ar, 37Ar and 36Ar signal, respectively. A turbo pumping station was used to achieve ultra-high vacuum conditions, and the biotite was then heated by the laser for 60\u00a0s to release the gases. Released gases was fixed at \u221280 to \u2212120\u00a0\u00b0C, and absorbed water and partial active gases were kept in the cold-trap. The gases were purified in the Zr-Al purification pump for 400\u00a0s, and then the Ar isotope compositions were measured in the mass spectrometer. Detailed instrumentation and analytical method procedures were as described by Bai et al. (2018). Data processing (incl. curved\/linear data regression, blank evolution analysis, age and J-value calculation, and air shot calculation) and plotting were performed with the ArArCALC (ver 2.52) program (Koppers, 2002). The analytical uncertainty was reported as 1\u03c3.\n\n\n4.3\nLA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating\nZircon grains from granodiorite ZK4401-4 (drill-core sample from 100\u00a0m depth) were separated by conventional magnetic and heavy liquid separation technique, and then handpicked under a binocular microscope. Subsequently, the zircon grains were mounted in epoxy resin, polished down to expose their interior, and then their morphology and internal structure were observed with optical microscopy (transmitted\/reflected light) and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging.\nThe analysis was performed at the Analysis and Testing Research Center of the China Metallurgical Geology Bureau (Shandong branch), using a COMPex PRO ArF Excimer Laser coupled with a Thermo Xeries 2 ICP\u2013MS. Analytical conditions include 8.5\u00a0J\/cm2 energy density, 8\u00a0Hz repetition rate, and 30\u00a0\u03bcm spot diameter. Zircon 91,500 was used as a standard for data calibration (Wiedenbeck et al. 1995). Data processing was conducted with the software ICPMSDataCal 4.3 (Liu et al. 2010), and age calculation and concordia plotting with ISOPLOT 3.0 (Ludwig, 2003). Common Pb correction was done with the method proposed by Andersen (2002).\n\n\n4.4\nHydrogen\u2013oxygen isotope analyses\nThe analyses were performed with a Finnigan-MAT253 mass spectrometer at the Analysis and Testing Research Center of Nuclear Industry (Beijing Institute of Geology). The quartz samples (from various stages and types of ore veins) were separated and handpicked to achieve\u00a0>\u00a099% purity. Oxygen was liberated from the quartz samples by reacting with BrF5 (Clayton and Mayeda, 1963), and the oxygen was then converted to CO2 on a Pt-coated carbon rod. Water in the fluid inclusions from the quartz grains was released by heating in an induction furnace (to\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0\u00b0C) and then reacting with Zn powder at 410\u00a0\u00b0C to generate hydrogen for the analysis (Friedman, 1953). The results were reported relative to VSMOW standards in per mille (\u2030), with\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u2030 precision for \u03b4D and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030 for \u03b418O. The ore-fluid \u03b418OFluid values were calculated with the formula 1000 ln\u03b1quartz-fluid\u00a0=\u00a03.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 T\u22122\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.40 (Clayton et al., 1972), where \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0fractionation factor and T\u00a0=\u00a0average homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions of the same stage (Hunan BGMR, 2019).\n\n\n4.5\nSulfur\u2013lead isotope analyses\nThe analyses were performed at the same laboratory as the H-O isotope analyses. The sulfide (pyrite and arsenopyrite) samples from quartz-sulfide ore veins were handpicked to attain\u00a0>\u00a099% purity. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) was prepared by combusting the sulfides with V2O5 at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C, and then the sulfur isotope compositions were measured with a MAT 253 gas isotope mass spectrometer. The GBW-04414 and GBW-04415 silver sulfide were analyzed as the standards, yielding \u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u2030 and\u00a0+\u00a022.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u2030, respectively. The results were reported relative to the Canon Diablo Troilite (CDT) in the \u03b434S notation, and the analytical precision is better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030. Meanwhile, lead from the sulfides was separated\/purified via conventional cation-exchange technique (AG1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08, 200\u2013400 resin) with diluted HBr as the eluent, and then analyzed with an IsoProbe-T Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS). Analysis of the Pb standard NBS981 yielded 208Pb\/206Pb\u00a0=\u00a02.1681\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0008, 207Pb\/206Pb\u00a0=\u00a00.91464\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00033, and 204Pb\/206Pb\u00a0=\u00a00.059042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000037 (2\u03c3).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nBiotite Ar-Ar age\nThe step-heating biotite 40Ar\u201339Ar measurement results for sample ZK602-9 are listed in Table 1\n, with the corresponding plateau and isochron ages illustrated in Fig. 8\n. The biotite 40Ar\u201339Ar plateau age is 208.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a02.09), calculated from nine successive stages with 48.9% of the released 39Ar (Fig. 8a). The normal isochron age (209.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.34\u00a0Ma, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.34) is consistent with the plateau age (Fig. 8b), suggesting that the quartz-sulfide veining occurred ca. 210\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n5.2\nZircon U-Pb age\nThe zircon samples are generally euhedral prismatic (size: 50\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcm), with aspect ratios of 2:1\u20133:1. The zircons are vaguely oscillatory zoned in CL images, and have varying but generally high U (1441\u20137700\u00a0ppm, avg. 4081\u00a0ppm) and Th (1074\u20134927\u00a0ppm, avg. 2662\u00a0ppm) contents (Fig. 9\n), giving Th\/U\u00a0=\u00a01.34\u20131.70 (avg. 1.50) that resemble typical magmatic zircons (Table 2\n; Hoskin and Schaltegger, 2003). Fourteen zircons plot along\/near the concordia, yielding 206Pb\/238U age\u00a0=\u00a0425\u2013436\u00a0Ma and a weighted mean age of 430.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.43; Fig. 9). This age likely represents the emplacement age of the granodiorite.\n\n\n5.3\nHydrogen-oxygen isotope compositions\nThe quartz H-O isotope compositions are listed in Table 3\n, featuring \u03b418OVSMOW = +15.5 to\u00a0+\u00a017.6\u2030 and \u03b4DVSMOW\u00a0=\u00a0\u201381.2 to \u201370.3\u2030. T from average homogenization temperature of the same-stage fluid inclusions (Hunan BGMR, 2019; Stage 1\u00a0=\u00a0305\u00a0\u00b0C, Stage 2\u00a0=\u00a0253\u00a0\u00b0C, Stage 3\u00a0=\u00a0175\u00a0\u00b0C). The calculated fluid \u03b418OFluid values are\u00a0+\u00a010.3 to\u00a0+\u00a010.9\u2030 (stage 1), +6.7 to\u00a0+\u00a06.9\u2030 (stage 2), and\u00a0+\u00a02.9 to\u00a0+\u00a03.1\u2030 (stage 3).\n\n\n5.4\nSulfur-lead compositions\nThe pyrite S and Pb isotope compositions are shown in Table 4 and 5\n\n, respectively. The pyrite samples have \u03b434SCDT\u00a0=\u00a0\u201313.7 to \u20134.6\u2030 (avg. \u20139.4\u2030). The sulfur isotopic signatures of the pyrite suggest a single sulfur source, and sulfur is present mainly in sulfide minerals, suggesting that no differential fractionation has occurred between the sulfide phases. Therefore, the average \u03b434SCDT value of the sulfide minerals in the Lishupo deposit may represent the \u03b434S\u2211S value of the ore-forming system. The samples have 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a018.230\u201318.642 (mean 18.452), 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.615\u201315.755 (mean 15.683), and 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a038.582\u201339.100 (mean 38.876).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nTiming of regional gold mineralization\nIn the Jiangnan Orogen, there are some reported Triassic gold mineralization ages using different methods. For example, the Au-Sb mineralization at the Longshan deposit in the central Jiangnan Orogen most likely occurred at 210\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma, based a Sm\u2013Nd isochron age of scheelite (Zhang et al., 2019c). The Gutaishan Au-Sb deposit formed at 224\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma based on a hydrothermal 40Ar\/39Ar age (Li et al., 2018). The timing of Au mineralization constraining from arsenopyrites at the Pingqiu deposit is 235\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma (Gu et al., 2016). Combined with the geological evidence for Au events, these isotopic age data are considered to indicate an important Au event in the Triassic (Xu et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2019a; and references therein). In the NE Hunan, previous geochronological works yielded ambiguous results for the regional gold mineralization. For instance, Rb\u2013Sr isochron ages were reported for the auriferous quartz at Tuanshanbei (222.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4\u00a0Ma; Han et al., 2010), Wangu (ca. 70\u00a0Ma and 425\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033\u00a0Ma; Mao and Li, 1997; Dong et al., 2008; Han et al., 2010), Huangjindong (152\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0Ma, Dong et al., 2008; 462\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma, Han et al., 2010), and Yanlinsi (electron spin resonance (ESR) age: 214.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u2013155.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0Ma; Huang et al., 2012). Such discrepancy may be caused by that Rb\u2013Sr isochron ages have generally large errors, due to the varying proportion of primary and secondary fluid inclusions in the samples. Meanwhile, ESR ages can be modified via isotopic resetting by overprinting thermal events.\nThe Ar-Ar geochronology has been widely applied in constraining hydrothermal mineralization ages due to its high accuracy. Recently, Deng et al. (2017) reported muscovite Ar\u2013Ar plateau age (130.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma; MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.9) from the Dayan Au prospect (NE Hunan). This Early Cretaceous Au metallogenic event is inferred to have occurred in response to the extension led by the Paleo-Pacific subducting slab rollback (Li and Li, 2007), or to the subduction direction change from coastline oblique to parallel (Mao et al., 2013). In this study, microscopic observations show that the biotite precipitated only in Stage 2, and the mineral assemblage consisting of quartz, dolomite, chlorite, pyrite, and galena is consistent with that of the gold-bearing ores in Stage 2 (Fig. 5j-l), suggesting that the biotite is of hydrothermal origin. Our Late Triassic biotite (cogenetic with the auriferous pyrite) Ar-Ar age (plateau age 208.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25\u00a0Ma) represents the timing of gold mineralization, and thus the Lishupo granodiorite (430.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma) is likely pre-mineralization and ore-unrelated. Regionally, this Late Triassic metallogenic event in NE Hunan was likely linked to the Paleo-Pacific subduction (Li and Li, 2007) or the post-collisional tectonics between the South China and the Indochina and\/or North China blocks (Wang et al., 2007; Mao et al., 2013).\n\n\n6.2\nSources of ore-forming fluids and materials\nSulfur and Pb isotope analyses provide an efficient tool for tracing the origins of sulfide components in ore deposits. The Lishupo pyrite \u03b434SCDT values fall in a relatively narrow range (\u201313.7 to \u20134.6\u2030) and show minor overlap with those of the Neoproterozoic slate ore-host and gold deposits, whose sulfur was interpreted to have sourced from metamorphic rocks (Fig. 9; Xu et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). The asymmetric \u03b434SCDT whiskers for pyrite in the slates (in the box-and-whisker plots) (Fig. 10\n) can also be explained by hydrothermal fluid-wall rock reaction (Zhang et al., 2018). The ore-pyrite \u03b434SCDT values are distinctly lower than those of porphyry ore sulfides in the region (Fig. 10), whose sulfur is predominantly magma-sourced (Lu et al., 1984; Liu et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017a, Wang et al., 2017b). The \u03b434SCDT values are also lower than those of bulk mantle (0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 \u2030), igneous rocks (+1\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a03\u2030), and crustal sulfur (mean\u00a0+\u00a07\u2030; Chaussidon et al., 1989; Chaussidon and Lorand, 1990). However, the Lishupo pyrite \u03b434SCDT values overlap significantly with those of Late Permian-Triassic and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous sediment-hosted orogenic gold deposits (Fig. 10), suggesting that the sulfur may have been derived from sediments in the accretionary wedge during the Late Triassic Paleo-Pacific subduction (Li and Li, 2007; Goldfarb et al., 2014; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Groves and Santosh, 2016), or the interactions between South China and the Indochina and\/or the North China blocks (Wang et al., 2007; Mao et al., 2013).\nLead isotopic features of the pyrite in the Lishupo deposit are similar to many other gold deposits in NE Hunan (incl. porphyry deposits), but distinct from those in the Lengjiaxi Group and Mesozoic granites in the study area (Fig. 11\n). This suggests that the lead may have sourced from deep-lying and high-grade metamorphic rocks (Xu et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2018). As there is typically limited lead being carried in low-salinity ore-forming fluids in orogenic gold systems (Kerrich, 1983), the Pb isotopes in deposits such as Lishupo can provide only limited insights into the source of metals because substantial amount of Pb would be sourced from the local fluid trap area during alteration events (Zhang et al., 2018). In the 207Pb\/204Pb vs. 206Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb vs. 206Pb\/204Pb diagrams, the Pb isotope data lie between the orogenic and upper crustal evolution curves (Fig. 11), suggesting that the lead was likely sourced from deep metasedimentary rocks in the belt.\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes are important tracers of the evolutionary history of ore-forming fluids. Quartz samples from the three stages yielded similar \u03b418OVSMOW values (+15.5 to\u00a0+\u00a017.6\u2030) to those of quartz from lode gold deposits (\u03b418OVSMOW, 10\u201318\u2030; Kyser et al., 1986; Kerrich, 1987; Goldfarb et al., 1991, 1997; McCuaig and Kerrich, 1998; Ivanove, 2000; Kerrich et al., 2000; Jia et al., 2001). \u03b4DVSMOW values of the Stage 1 and 2 ore forming fluids are also within the range of typical lode gold deposits (McCuaig and Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Chen et al., 2012). However, such obtained fluid represents a bulk extraction of fluid inclusion waters possibly from many generations of fluid inclusions within gold-bearing quartz. The inclusion waters of multiple generations will lead to lower \u03b4D measurements during bulk extraction (Baatartsogt et al., 2007; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). In the \u03b4DVSMOW vs. \u03b418OFluid discrimination plot (Fig. 12\n), the Lishupo Stage 1 and 2 samples plot inside the metamorphic or magmatic water fields or outside the fields but close to the metamorphic water and orogenic-type gold deposits fields. This indicates that the ore-forming fluids may have derived mainly from metamorphic-sourced terrane, which is typical of orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 2003; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015).\nIn summary, based on these H\u2013O\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopic composition data, it is inferred that the ore-forming fluids and metals of the Lishupo deposit were mainly sourced from the metamorphosed source. However, considering exposed Neoproterozoic slates in the study area have only undergone greenschist facies metamorphism, the slates may not be an effective ore-forming material source. A deeper and higher metamorphic grade source is required (Tomkins, 2010), either from higher facies metamorphic rocks underlying the slate unit or from a subduction zone related to the orogenic event associated with gold deposition (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Groves and Santosh, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018).\n\n\n6.3\nGenesis of the Lishupo Au deposit\nGold deposits in the NE Hunan such as Yanlinsi, Zhengchong, Xiaojiashan, Hengjiangchong, Wangu, Huangjindong, and Lishupo deposits have been produced (Ye et al., 1988; Huang et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017b; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b), and the metallogenic models have been proposed to be intrusion-related, orogenic-type and intracontinental reactivation-type (Mao and Li, 1997; Dong et al., 2008; Goldfarb et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2017, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b). Intrusion-related deposits are spatially and temporally associated with a range of felsic intrusions. They have a metal association that includes mainly Au, Mo, Bi, and W. Alteration mineral and metal zonation surrounding intrusions are features common to intrusion-related deposits. However, such features are not observed in the Lishupo deposit. Mineralization features at Lishupo resemble typical orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015 and references therein): (1) Auriferous quartz\u2013carbonate\u2013sulfide veins are structurally controlled by ductile shear zones; (2) Gold mineralization at Lishupo are hosted in the highly-deformed Lengjiaxi Group slate and meta-graywacke; (3) Metallic minerals at Lishupo include mainly pyrite and arsenopyrite, and minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena; (4) Ore-related alterations include silicification, sericite, chlorite, and carbonate.\nBased on the S\u2013Pb\u2013H\u2013O isotopic data, it is likely that the ore fluid and material were metamorphic-sourced with certain magmatic input. In the metamorphic devolatilization model for orogenic gold deposits (Pitcairn et al., 2006; Phillips and Powell, 2010; Tomkins, 2010), the source rocks are devolatilized by metamorphism at the greenschist\u2013amphibolite-facies boundary. This released auriferous fluids and the gold ores are deposited in the greenschist-facies metamorphic zone. However, the exposed Neoproterozoic slates have only undergone greenschist-facies metamorphism, and thus may not be the main ore sulfur and metal source. A deeper metamorphic source is required (e.g., Tomkins, 2010; Zhang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020b), for instance from the metamorphic rocks beneath the slate unit, a metamorphosed accretionary sediment wedge or metasomatized lithosphere mantle (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Groves and Santosh, 2016; Deng et al., 2020).\nIn the central Jiangnan Orogen, the gold deposits discovered (e.g., Huangjindong, Wangu, Yanlingsi, Zhengchong, Xiaojia, Pingcha, Chanziping, Mobin, Liulincha, Banxi, Woxi and Yangtuanwan) are commonly hosted in Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and controlled by ductile shear zones, and are characterized by quartz veins with relatively minor sulfide minerals (Deng, et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2018, 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b), suggesting orogenic-type mineralization across the central Jiangnan Orogen (He et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2013; Ni et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b). Future exploration in the region should concentrate on the zone of critical structural geometries in the Neoproterozoic slates. Significant characteristics for exploration including: (1) the schistosity zone and interlayer fracture zone in the Neoproterozoic slates; (2) asymmetrical fold deformation zones and related faults; (3) zones second-order of NE and WNW -trending faults; (4) intersections between such faults and regionally related to NNE- to NE-trending crustal-scale oblique-slip faults.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nAlteration and gold mineralization at Lishupo comprises three stages: (1) quartz (Q1)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py1)\u2013arsenopyrite mineralization, (2) quartz (Q2)\u2013dolomite\u2013pyrite (Py2)\u2013polymetallic sulfide mineralization, and (3) quartz (Q3)\u2013carbonate veining.\n\n\n(2)\nBiotite 40Ar\u201339Ar dating constrains the Lishupo gold mineralization at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0210\u00a0Ma, broadly coeval with the Late Triassic regional gold mineralization in NE Hunan.\n\n\n(3)\nMultiple (H-O-S-Pb) isotopic data suggest the ore fluid and material were likely originated from a deep metamorphic source. The isotopic data and mineralization characteristics altogether demonstrate that the Lishupo gold mineralization is best classified as orogenic-type.\n\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Malayer-Esfahan metallogenic belt (MEMB) is one of the most important Zn-Pb (\u00b1Ba\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Ag), Fe-Mn-Pb (\u00b1Ba\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Cu), and barite metallogenic belts in Iran (Fig. 1\n) (Momenzadeh, 1976). The belt is located on the northern margin of the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone which experienced several phases of tectonic and magmatic activity as well as metallogenesis, spatially associated with areas of continental fault-bound sedimentary basins (Momenzadeh, 1976; Mohajjel and Fergusson, 2014). Most ore deposits in the MEMB can be clustered into nine districts in which the Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous sedimentation was particularly extensive (Fig. 2\n). These clusters or districts, from northwest to southeast, are (Fig. 2): Southeast Malayer, South Arak, Delijan, Aligoudarz, Golpaygan, Khonsar, North Tiran, Irankouh, and South Shahreza mining districts. The MEMB hosts three world-class (Irankouh, Ahangaran, and Emarat) and more than ten medium-sized sediment-hosted Zn-Pb (\u00b1Ba\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Ag), Fe-Mn-Pb (\u00b1Ba\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Cu), and barite deposits that are presumed to have formed in the Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous, and traditionally been considered to represent a typical sediment-hosted ore belt in Iran (Figs. 1 and 2) (Momenzadeh, 1976). Previous investigations on the MEMB ore deposits have resulted in the development of three main genetic models: (1) Syn-sedimentary to early diagenetic Zn-Pb mineralization occurrences in a sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX)-like environment at Irankouh and Ahangaran before subsequent regional metamorphism and remobilization in post-Cretaceous times (e.g., Momenzadeh, 1976; Momenzadeh et al., 1979; Rastad, 1981; Zamanian, 1993); (2) Sub-seafloor replacement mineralization in an Irish-like environment at Kouh-Kolangeh, Robat, and Ahangaran (Peernajmodin, 2018; Peernajmodin et al., 2018; Maanijou et al., 2020); (3) Epigenetic or Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) formations (Ghazban et al., 1994; Ehya et al., 2010; Hosseini-Dinani and Aftabi, 2015; Karimpour and Sadeghi, 2018; Liu et al., 2019).\nThe Southeast Malayer, South Arak, and Delijan mining districts contain sideritic-ankeritic iron deposits in the MEMB (Fig. 2). These deposits are Shamsabad, Ahangaran, Sarchal, Darreh-Rasoul, Golparabad, Kahak, Raveh, Khoreh, and Meimeh (Fig. 2) (Izanloo et al., 2016; Aghamolaei et al., 2017; Peernajmodin, 2018; Foroutan-Nia et al., 2021). The Fe orebodies occur as stratabound, stratoid, and lenticular bodies and are mainly hosted in the Lower Cretaceous carbonates and locally in the Jurassic siliciclastic rocks (Fig. 2). One of the most important districts for sideritic-ankeritic iron mineralization in the MEMB is the Lower Cretaceous Delijan mining district (DMD) which is host to the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh iron deposits (Izanloo, 2018) (Fig. 2). The Raveh, Kahak, and Khoreh iron deposits are in the Markazi Province, 43, 36, and 26\u00a0km northwest of the city of Delijan, respectively (Fig. 2). The potential reserves of iron ore have been estimated to be 8 million metric tons of ore grading 40-49\u00a0wt% Fe (Izanloo, 2018). In this study, we focus on the geological evolution of the iron mineralization at Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits and examine precisely how sideritic-ankeritic orebodies formed in the hydrothermal carbonate assemblage. We demonstrate the paragenesis and mineralogical assemblages that are associated with sub-seafloor replacement of pre-existing carbonate. In addition, the sulfur isotope composition and fluid inclusions of mineral phases from the different ore facies were analyzed to evaluate potential fluid sources and ore-forming processes during hydrothermal activity.\n\n\n2\nGeology of the DMD\nThe MEMB is situated in the northern part of the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone (Fig. 1). The Sanandaj-Sirjan zone is separated from the Central Iran Microcontinent by the Tertiary Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic belt to the northeast (Fig. 1). To the southwest, the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone is separated from the Zagros Mountains by the Main Zagros Thrust Fault. The MEMB consists of a Precambrian basement overlain by Paleozoic sediments (Fig. 2). The metamorphic basement is represented by \u223c578 to 596\u00a0Ma leucogranite and biotite-rich granite rocks in the Muteh area of the MEMB (Hassanzadeh et al., 2008). These basement rocks are overlain by Lower Cambrian or Ordovician sedimentary rocks. In this belt, the Middle Paleozoic Formations are not developed and the Lower Cambrian sedimentary rocks (Kahar Formation) are directly overlain by the Permo-Triassic rocks in the Mahalat-Muteh, and Borujerd-Damaneh districts (Momenzadeh, 1976). Most of the ore-bearing sedimentary sequences in the MEMB are Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous and are strongly deformed as a consequence of the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean during the post-Cretaceous orogeny (Momenzadeh, 1976).\nThe DMD lies within the MEMB which comprises Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sedimentary- (volcanic) rocks deposited in a back-arc basin (Mohajjel and Fergusson, 2014). District geology is characterized by extensive faulting, folding, and very low-grade metamorphism (Izanloo, 2018), and is mapped according to a framework of tectonic packages of varying scales (Fig. 3\n; Izanloo et al., 2016; Izanloo, 2018). The Upper Triassic \u2013 Middle Jurassic Shemshak Formation is one of the most extensive lithostratigraphic rock units within the DMD (Figs. 3\u00a0and\u00a04\nC). Highly variable thicknesses reaching up to\u00a0\u223c\u00a01000\u00a0m, a nearly exclusively siliciclastic nature, widespread coal beds, and environments ranging from proximal alluvial fans to deep marine are characteristic features of the Shemshak Formation (Fursich et al., 2009). It mainly consists of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, siltstone, shale, and highly carbonaceous shale.\nThe Lower Cretaceous sequence consists of a basal conglomerate (Kc1) overlain by fine-grained quartzitic sandstone (Kc2), tuff (Kcv), dolomite (Kc3), carbonate and siliciclastic-rich sediments (Km), massive orbitolina limestone (Kl), and marl, as well as shale and limestone (Ks), and unconformably overlie the Shemshak Formation of Jurassic sequence (Figs. 3\u00a0and\u00a04A). All of these units were deposited during episodes of rifting, volcanism, and post-rift subsidence (Izanloo, 2018). The Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits in the DMD are hosted by the Lower Cretaceous carbonatic-siliciclastic rocks (Figs. 3 and 4). The geology and host rock of all three deposits are similar (Fig. 3). The Kc2, Kcv, Kc3, and Km units within the Lower Cretaceous sequence, host to Fe mineralization in the DMD (Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits) (Fig. 4C). These units are approx. 400\u00a0m thick but increase in thickness from north of the Khoreh to the Kahak deposit (Fig. 4C). Near the deposits, the Kc2 unit consists of a \u223c40-m-thick succession of mostly gray to red quartzitic sandstones with minor interbeds of altered intermediate composition tuffs (Kcv) (Fig. 4B). The dark-gray dolomitic rocks of the Kc3 unit conformably overlie the Kc2 unit with a maximum thickness of\u00a0\u223c\u00a050\u00a0m (Fig. 4A). There are also interbedded layers of intermediate composition tuffs (Kcv) within this stratigraphic unit (Fig. 4B and C). Tuffs are thinly (10-50\u00a0cm) bedded, have sharp bases and their main constituents are plagioclase and lithic crystals. The crystals are generally aligned, resulting in laminae. Disseminated and rounded oxide pyrite crystals are present. Silicification and carbonatization widely occur in tuffaceous rocks. The Km unit which conformably overlies the Kc3 unit consists of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic-rich sediments (Fig. 4).\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\nMineralogical, geochemical, and fluid inclusion microthermometric studies were performed on 80 samples collected from the ore zones, dumps, and outcrops of the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits. Forty-two polished and twenty thin-polished sections of representative ore samples were investigated under reflected and transmitted light.\nFive doubly-polished sections from coexisting siderite and barite were prepared for microthermometric studies to obtain a preliminary estimate of the temperatures and salinities of the ore-bearing fluid. Fluid inclusions were observed only in the barite. No suitable fluid inclusions were identified in the siderite; the observed inclusions were either too small for microthermometric measurement or were considered to be secondary occurrences. Fluid inclusion assemblages were mapped and classified petrographically using the criteria by Roedder (1984), and Goldstein and Reynolds (1994). Microthermometric measurements were carried out using a Linkam THMSG-600 heating\u2013freezing stage at the Department of Economic Geology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran. The stage was calibrated with a series of synthetic fluid inclusions of known compositions. The accuracy is\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C below 350\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00b0C on freezing. Salinities of liquid-rich fluid inclusions were calculated from measured last ice-melting temperatures using the equation of Haas (1976).\nA subset of 3 polished thin sections was selected for electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of ankerite, regional dolomite, hydrothermal dolomite, and calcite, from the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits in order to characterize them and determine the overall paragenetic sequence. The polished thin sections were carbon-coated and analyzed on a Cameca SX100\u00ae electron microprobe at the Iranian Mineral Processing Research Center (IMPRC), Karaj, Iran. Elements measured include Fe, Ca, Mg, and Mn; and standards for these elements are chalcopyrite, dolomite, and rhodonite, respectively. The detection limits for major and minor elements are 0.05\u00a0wt%, and 0.01\u00a0wt%, respectively. Operating conditions are electron beam potential of 20\u00a0keV, current of 20nA, and a beam diameter of 3\u00a0\u03bcm. Data were reduced using ZAF matrix correction.\nBarite samples for S isotopic analysis were separated carefully with a dental drill. Sulfur isotope analyses from the same batch of powder were performed at the Radiogenic and Stable Isotope Geochemistry Laboratories, in the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS). Barite powder (10\u201325\u00a0mg) and sodium metaphosphate with a weight ratio of 1:10 were fully mixed with copper turnings in a quartz tube and then combusted to 720\u00a0\u00b0C. Resultant SO2 gases were isolated cryogenically in a vacuum line and sealed in an ultrapure quartz tube. The purified SO2 gases extracted from sulfate were used to analyze the sulfur isotopic ratio in a Finnigan Delta-S mass spectrometer. The error of reproducibility is better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030, based on multiple analyses of the standards.\n\n\n4\nOre geology and mineralization\nThe known deposits of the DMD (Raveh, Khoreh, and Kahak) are stratabound and mainly hosted either within the dolomites or sandstone rocks (Fig. 4C). The Raveh deposit is large, reaches lengths of 200 to 250\u00a0m, and has a thickness ranging from 15 to 20\u00a0m, with an average ore grade of approximately 55% Fe. The Khoreh deposit is approximately 50\u201380\u00a0m long and on average 10\u201320\u00a0m thick. The Kahak deposit is on average 10\u00a0m long and 3\u00a0m thick. Field investigation indicates that siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite are concentrated in Kc2, Kcv, Kc3, and Km units. The orebodies are conformably interlayered with the host rocks and have relatively transitional boundaries (Figs. 3\u00a0and\u00a04C). Mineralogical and petrographical studies show that the most important primary ore mineral is siderite. The siderite is associated with ankerite and ferroan dolomite in almost all deposits, especially in those within the carbonate rocks. Orebodies in the lower parts of the ore zones tend to be enriched in siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite; while the orebodies in the upper parts of the ore zones are richer in iron oxide\/hydroxides (hematite, gothite and limonite minerals).\nThe carbonatic units in the area are the most likely rocks to react with hydrothermal fluids. These rocks were replaced and altered by ore-forming fluids. Almost all outcrops and mining operations are located in the oxidation zones. These zones involve supergene alteration products. This mainly includes hematite and goethite (iron oxy-hydroxide gossans) derived from the supergene alteration of primary siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite, which is preserved only in the deeper part of the deposit (Izanloo et al., 2016; Izanloo, 2018). Microscopically, almost all ore samples from the gossans contain siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite relics within a hematite, goethite, and limonite matrix. This oxy-hydroxide zone is widespread throughout the mining district and is commonly brecciatic and sometimes has a specular texture. This iron oxy-hydroxide gossan type of ore corresponds to>85% of the total number of mine excavations and prospects and also comprises the largest portion of the deposits in the district. Most parts of the deposits are characterized by secondary oxide mineral assemblages.\nExtensive sideritization, dolomitization, and silicification of the dolomites and sandstone rocks of the Kc2, Kcv, Kc3, and Km units are associated with the iron ore lenses (Fig. 6). Siderite-dolomite-quartz and siderite-only assemblages dominate in direct contact with the iron ores. This is followed outward by dolomite-only assemblages that account for 50 to 70% of the altered rock volume. The altered rocks generally have transitional contacts with the unaltered limestones. The deposits are characterized by vein-veinlet-shaped stringer zone overlain by stratiform-stratabound zones (Fig. 5\n\nA). Based on the textures and style of mineralization, three major textural ore-facies are distinguished: massive, bedded, and vein-veinlet ores (stringer zone) (Izanloo et al., 2016; Izanloo, 2018) (Figs. 5 and 6).\nSemi-massive to massive-replacement iron ores dominate in the deposit (Fig. 5A and B). The geometry and structural characteristics indicate that calcitic and dolomitic host rocks were replaced by the siderite mineralization, and the host-rock inclusions represent unreplaced relics (Fig. 6C and 7E). This ore-facies is best described as massive conformable lenses, forming some of the highest-grade ore in the mines, with vertical intersections of up to 10\u00a0m of\u00a0>\u00a050 percent Fe. The massive ore-facies comprise siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite with barite, and minor pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena as sulfide minerals (Figs. 6, 7, and 8\n\n). In all deposits of the DMD, the mineralogy of the stringer zone and bedded ore facies is similar to the mineralogy of the massive ore facies. However, in some hand specimens, compositional banding with a probable pre-supergene origin is still recognizable. They have many characteristics in common, especially the occurrence of iron minerals in bands parallel to bedding, separated by bands of more or less barren host rocks (Fig. 5E, and 6A, B). The bedded ore facies of stratigraphically higher iron horizons comprise several related styles of stratiform iron carbonate and vary from 0.10 to 1.0\u00a0m in thickness. In the stringer zone, iron ores mostly occur as networks of veinlets within the host rock, or as a matrix between larger host-rock fragments (Fig. 5). Veins ranging from a few centimeters to 0.30\u00a0m thicknesses occur throughout the deposits, containing siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite, barite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena; however, these facies of vein mineralization are quantitatively a minor component of the main ore. Angular, brecciated mineralization is preferentially developed in the stringer zone (Fig. 5A and B).\n\n\n5\nMineralogy, mineral chemistry, and paragenesis\nDetailed textural investigations of the ore assemblages reveal the presence of replacement textures among the carbonate minerals. Based on hand specimens selected from the outcrops and drill cores and considering different petrographic features (color, size, and their interrelations), two types of dolomites were distinguished in the DMD deposits: regional or diagenetic dolomite (DR) and hydrothermal dolomite (DH). The microcrystalline calcite (Cal 1) of the limestones has been almost completely replaced by regional dolomite, ferroan dolomite, siderite, and ankerite (Fig. 6C and 7C). The regional dolomite (DR) replaces primary calcite (Cal 1) within the barren limestone rocks. DR is a fine-grained (0.4\u20134\u00a0mm) dolomicrite that is fabric-retentive and suggests that dolomitization has started shortly after the inception of burial, at low temperatures during the early stages of the diagenesis. These dolomites are named regional dolomites (DR). The micro-textures of the regional dolomites are replaced by closely packed anhedral saddle hydrothermal ferroan dolomites (DH) (Fig. 6E and 7B, D). Locally, the limestone\u2013dolomite contact is characterized by a halo of dolomite crystals occurring in clusters within the leached limestone, which represents a transitional zone between the altered and unaltered host rocks of the associated orebody. In comparison with DR dolomite, the hydrothermal ferroan dolomite occurs in coarse-crystalline euhedral rhombs, granular, massive, and irregular forms (Fig. 6D and 7B). The intensity of DH dolomitization increases with increased depth. Both dolomite minerals are partially and locally replaced by ore minerals (ankerite, siderite, barite, and sulfide minerals) (Fig. 6E, F and 7D, E, F). XRD analyses of DH dolomite from the ore deposits show an association of the dolomite with quartz, ankerite, and calcite (Fig. 8A, B, C, D). DH dolomite occurs in two generations at the deposits in the DMD. The first generation of DH dolomite (DH 1) is characterized by fine grain sizes and is associated with the fine-grained siderite (Sid 1) and ankerite (Ank 1) formed during the early ore stage (Fig. 6E and 7C, D). The second generation (DH 2) is characterized by coarse-grained idiomorphic forms and is associated with coarse-grained siderite (Sid 2), and ankerite (Ank 2) formed during the last ore stage (Fig. 6C and 7B). The Si content of both dolomites (DR and DH) vary between 0.02 and 0.47\u00a0wt%, without a significant difference in between DR and DH (Fig. 9\nA). DH dolomite in the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits is commonly Fe-rich (5.47 to 0.83\u00a0wt%) (Fig. 9B), which is consistent with deep burial or hydrothermal fluids (Tucker and Wright, 1990; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994; Azmy et al., 2008, 2009; Conliffe et al., 2009; Maghfouri et al., 2014, 2016). A coarse crystalline calcite cement (Cal 2) is the last diagenetic phase recorded in the ore-bearing Lower Cretaceous carbonates which partly to completely fills the remaining pores and fractures still open after the DH precipitation. The Mg content of DH and DR ranges from 10.12 to 13.37\u00a0wt%. In the dolomite minerals, Fe is positively correlated with Mn, and Ca shows a negative correlation with Si (Fig. 9B). Calcites have Ca contents in the range from 39.07 to 43.28\u00a0wt% (average value of 41.81, n\u00a0=\u00a05, Table 1\n). The Mg contents of calcites cover a narrow span between 0.06 and 1.17\u00a0wt% (average value of 0.53, n\u00a0=\u00a05). Calcite has Fe of\u00a0<\u00a00.25\u00a0wt% (Fig. 9B, Table 1).\nStrong iron mineralization has led to the replacement of most former minerals with siderite and ankerite. Ankerite is quite abundant in all deposits of the DMD and is partially replaced by iron oxy-hydroxide minerals (Fig. 6E, F, and 7E). Two generations of ankerite are present in the deposits from the DMD: the microcrystalline disseminated ankerite (Ank 1) and the coarse crystalline ankerite (Ank 2). Early-stage ankerite (Ank 1) is associated with Sid 1 (Fig. 6E and 7D, E). The textural relationships between siderite and ankerite indicate a co-genetic crystallization. XRD analysis reveals the presence of an association of ankerite with quartz, siderite, and calcite (Fig. 8A, B). The ankerites are composed of 10.88 to 26.53\u00a0wt% Ca, 5.41 to 12.56\u00a0Mg and 1.05 to 7.58\u00a0wt% Mn (Fig. 9B, Table 1). Ankerites from the Kahak deposit show a compositional range with values of 11.48 to 18.22\u00a0wt% Fe, 0.3 to 0.39\u00a0wt% Si (Table 1).\nSiderite is the second most abundant component of the mineralization after ankerite, as it occurs in all the Kc2, Kcv, Kc3, and Km units, in the massive ore facies and the footwall altered sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks of the stringer zone. Under the microscope, the siderite appears commonly as fine-grained subhedral forms (Sid 1) and as large as 3 to 5\u00a0mm in diameter (Sid 2) (Figs. 6 and 7). Siderite is associated with ankerite, dolomite, barite, quartz, calcite, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of an association of siderite with quartz and calcite.\nTwo generations of pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite are well developed in Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh. The early generation (Py1, Cpy1, Gn1, and Sph1) is fine-grained and disseminated, while the later generation (Py2, Cpy2, Gn2 and Sph2) is coarse-grained and euhedral, with massive and vein-veinlets type ore textures, filling the fractures and intergranular pores between siderite and ankerite (Fig. 7A). Sulfides and barites filled intergranular pore space and vugs of regional dolomites (DR). Detailed petrographic observations have revealed that oxidization has overprinted the DMD orebodies, resulting in an extremely complex oxidized mineral assemblage. >4 oxidation products have been identified, including hematite, goethite, pyrolusite, and limonite.\n\n\n6\nFluid inclusion studies\nBarites from the hydrothermal ore stage display a close association with iron mineralization. They are also rich in fluid inclusions; hence they are selected for petrographic and microthermometric studies. Based on the composition and phases present at room temperature, two main types of fluid inclusions were identified in the hydrothermal barites from the deposits of the DMD (Fig. 10\nA, B). They include (1) liquid-rich two-phase, and (2) liquid-rich and\/or vapor-rich mono-phase inclusions. The fluid inclusions measured are the two-phase (liquid\u00a0+\u00a0vapor; L\u00a0+\u00a0V) inclusions and range in size from 2 to 15\u00a0\u03bcm. The liquid-rich two-phase inclusions are the most abundant ones in barites of the main mineralization stage. Inclusions in barite are found as clusters at the core of the host crystals can be very large (8\u00a0\u03bcm) with respect to their host crystals. Therefore, inclusions in the barite are considered primary in origin and represent the fluid trapped during the crystal growth. Primary fluid inclusion assemblages in the barite are characterized by a consistent degree of fill (liquid\u2044vapor ratio) indicating little or no post entrapment re-equilibrium (leaking or necking down of inclusions). The results of the heating and freezing experiments from the barite samples are summarized in Table 2\n and are also shown in Fig. 10C, D. Twenty-five primary fluid inclusions were studied in the barite crystals. Ice melting temperatures (Tm(ice)) ranges from \u221218 to \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C yielding a wide range of fluid salinities between 7.8 and 16.8\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. Inclusions in barite homogenize (Th(l-v)) to the liquid phase between 162 and 210\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10C, D).\n\n\n7\nSulfur isotopes\nA total of fifteen sulfur isotopic analyses were completed in barite, from the stringer zone (n\u00a0=\u00a04), massive ore-facies (n\u00a0=\u00a07), and breccia ore (n\u00a0=\u00a04) of the Kahak deposit (Table 3\n). \u03b434S values in the Kahak deposit present a wide range of variation, from\u00a0+\u00a010.69 to\u00a0+\u00a031.98\u2030 (Table 3). The \u03b434S values of barites in the stringer zone range from 12.23 to 29.68\u2030. The \u03b434S values of the barite, associated with the iron mineralization in the breccia zone, vary between 18.13 and 26.97\u2030 (Fig. 14B). The \u03b434S values of barite for the massive ore facies range from 10.69 to 31.98\u2030 (Table 3).\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\n\n8.1\nSources of ore-forming fluids and sulfur\nTwo-phase (aqueous fluid\u00a0+\u00a0vapor bubble) primary inclusions have relatively uniform phase ratios and lack any evidence for boiling or phase separation at the site of mineral precipitation. Salinities of primary fluid inclusions, calculated using the temperature of final ice disappearance (between \u221218 and \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C), range from about 7.8 to 16.8\u00a0wt% NaCl (Table 2). The arithmetic mean of the homogenization temperatures for these inclusions are around 186\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 2, Fig. 10). To determine the origin of the ore fluid, we plotted the calculated salinities versus the measured homogenization temperatures (Fig. 11\nA; Kesler, 2005). In this diagram, the fluid inclusions show basinal and sea water characteristics (Fig. 11A). Therefore, we conclude that a decrease in temperatures and salinities from the stockwork zone towards the bedded ore facies occurred due to the mixing between cold seawater and hydrothermal fluids, where the proportion of seawater was higher in the bedded ore than in the stockwork zone. Based on the diagram of salinity versus homogenization temperature (Cooke et al., 2000; Wilkinson, 2001; Goodfellow, 2004; Large et al., 2005), the microthermometric data in the barite for the deposits from the DMD are consistent with those reported from SEDEX-deposits such as Selwyn basin, Canada (Goodfellow, 2004), Farahabad deposit, Central Iran (Maghfouri et al., 2020a), Mishu, Iran (Ghorbani et al., 2019; Ghorbani Derakhshi et al., 2020), Mansourabad, Central Iran (Maghfouri and Hosseinzadeh, 2018), and Mehdiabad, Central Iran (Maghfouri et al., 2015, Maghfouri et al., 2018a, Maghfouri et al., 2019, Maghfouri et al., 2020b, Maghfouri et al., 2021). Moreover, according to this diagram, the samples of the study area have formed within the temperature and salinity ranges of the vent-proximal SEDEX-type and Irish-type deposits (Fig. 11B). Like other SEDEX-type Zn-Pb deposits (Lydon, 1995; Leach et al., 2005; Maghfouri, 2017), ore-forming fluids in the deposits from the DMD are intermediate density metalliferous basinal brines (Fig. 11B). The results of fluid inclusion analysis show that the ore fluid is a moderate-temperature Na+\u2013Cl\u2212 system, which can be considered as broadly similar to what has been identified in vent-proximal SEDEX deposits, but slightly different concerning temperature, salinity, and density of the ore fluid.\nPrevious workers have interpreted strongly positive \u03b434S barite values in the sediment-hosted ore deposits (e.g., Selwyn Basin) to be the result of barite precipitation from a euxinic water column (Goodfellow and Jonasson, 1984). In this model, the \u03b434S barite values above coeval seawater develop from bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) in a restricted water column. However, barite minerals precipitated during diagenesis can preserve a wide range of \u03b434S values (e.g., Present et al., 2015). Sulfur isotope values recorded for the barite minerals collected from the deposits of the DMD range from\u00a0+\u00a010.69 to\u00a0+\u00a031.98\u2030, i.e., values are equivalent to or significantly higher than the \u03b434S composition of Lower Cretaceous seawater sulfate (Fig. 12\n) (15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 per mil; cf. Claypool et al., 1980). Typical values of coeval seawater overlap with the lowest part of our range of data suggesting that the sulfur in barite was primarily derived from the coeval seawater sulfate, either directly from the ocean or dissolved marine evaporites (Bottrell and Newton, 2006). This further indicates that the sulfur of the barite minerals from the deposits in the DMD was sourced from contemporaneous seawater modified by variable amounts of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) in a restricted basin (Kelley et al., 2004a,b; Bottrell and Newton, 2006; Wilkinson, 2014).\n\n\n8.2\nSub-seafloor replacement process\nIn the deposits of the DMD, syn-sedimentary faults controlled the formation of seafloor depressions that may have trapped brines, acted as conduits for ore fluids, and generated debris flow breccias that become mineralized. In addition, normal faulting also played a fundamental role in the localization of mineralization and hydrothermal alteration at the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits. The maximum thickness of ankeritic and sideritic mineralization in the massive-replacement ore facies is found to be close to the syn-sedimentary faults, suggesting that this syn-sedimentary structure acted as the most important conduit for hydrothermal fluid flow (Fig. 13\nA). As discussed above, the bedded ore facies of the ore deposits formed as exhalites on the seafloor, whereas the massive iron-rich portions formed by sub-seafloor replacement or infilling of existing dolomites (DR) (Fig. 13B). The distribution of DR in the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits may have been important for controlling the replacement of carbonate layers by hydrothermal dolomite (DH), ankerite, and siderite. Pre-mineralization (DR), and syn-mineralization dolomitization (DH) have both been documented in the district (Izanloo, 2018). Dolomite formed prior to the introduction of metal-bearing fluids, may have formed permeable horizons for the fluids, thereby controlling\/facilitating fluid flow through carbonate layers.\nPrimary textural features, assumed to represent syn-sedimentary exhalative co-precipitation of ore minerals, may also result from the sub-seafloor replacement by siderite and ankerite layers within dolomite during sedimentation and early diagenesis (e.g., Anarraaq deposit, northern Alaska; Kelley et al., 2004a, b). Therefore, the various mineralized ore facies at Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits represent both syn-sedimentary mineralization (bedded ore facies) on\/near the seafloor and \u201cdiagenetic\u201d mineralization by sub-seafloor process (stringer zone and massive-replacement ore facies). However, the diagenetic mineralization occurred simultaneously with or shortly after the syn-sedimentary mineralization and was related to the same, albeit evolving, mineralizing system. Sub-seafloor replacement is recognized as an important process in SEDEX and Irish-type deposits (Goodfellow et al., 1993; Perkins and Bell, 1998; Wilkinson, 2014) and is postulated in several VMS deposits (e.g., Doyle and Allen, 2003; Tornos et al., 2015; Maghfouri et al., 2018b). Wilkinson (2014) defines sub-seafloor replacement deposits as deposits where the ores are hosted by carbonate and clastic rocks; they also have syn-sedimentary normal faults controlling the deposition of massive sulfides, formally known as sub-seafloor replacement SEDEX. These deposits (e.g., Mehdiabad) have many morphological and textural similarities to Irish-type ore bodies. Based on Wilkinson (2014), it is clear that the sub-seafloor replacement SEDEX-type deposits ore bodies are more akin to typical examples of the SEDEX family than to typical examples of the MVT clan. A similar model has been proposed by Maghfouri et al. (2019, 2020b) for the Mehdiabad and Farahabad deposits in Iran, where zones of massive ore facies formed through sub-seafloor replacement by hot (>200\u00a0\u00b0C) hydrothermal fluids. At the Shamsabad deposit in MEMB, early Fe-Mn seafloor exhalites were followed by major sub-seafloor siderite and ankerite deposition by replacement of host limestone (Peernajmodin, 2018). Collectively, our findings provide strong evidence for a subsurface carbonate replacement-style mineral system at the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits.\n\n\n8.3\nConceptual model of ore genesis\nBased on sedimentological and stratigraphic evaluation of the Lower Cretaceous units, we propose the following idealized two-stage model, illustrated in Fig. 13. A comparison of the representative deposit-scale stratigraphic columns through the three deposits (Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh) indicates that each deposit is located in lithologically distinct parts of the Lower Cretaceous units (Fig. 4C). The orebody is hosted in dolomite, sandstone, and tuff rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Kc2, Kcv, Kc3, and Km units (Fig. 4C). Ores are stratabound and occur as beds or lenticular bodies (Fig. 5A, B). The geological characteristics of the iron deposits suggest that the geometry of the deposits is controlled by the sedimentary bedding. There are notable similarities between the mineralization, geometry, and morphology of the ore facies of the early stage (ore stage 1) from Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits and the major sedimentary-exhalative deposits (Maghfouri et al., 2017; Tajeddin et al., 2019; Movahednia et al., 2020). Syn-sedimentary mineralization in a deep-water basinal setting has been proposed to account for the finely-layered and concordant nature of ore minerals. Distinct points along segmented syn-sedimentary normal fault arrays are identified as feeders to many of the orebodies within the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits. These feeders control the location of the orebodies along various fault segments (Fig. 13A). Here, fluids spill out into the hanging wall near the base of the Kc1 and Kc2 units (Fig. 13B). Hydrothermal fluids entering these sedimentary units along the syn-sedimentary fault systems produced hydrothermal dolomites and early-generation siderite, ankerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena.\nAt the deposits of the DMD, the bulk of the siderite, ankerite, barite, sphalerite, and galena mineralization is restricted to stratabound replacements and breccias (ore stage 2). In this latter stage, formational brines in the Jurassic sediments of the basement were heated by underlying Kcv volcanism, forming a high temperature (>200\u00a0\u00b0C), acidic, reducing crustal hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 13B). The hydrothermal fluids ascended along syn-sedimentary normal faults and reacted with the volcanic and siliciclastic rocks of the footwall sequence, acquiring abundant Fe and other elements of economic importance. The hydrothermal fluids vented into the sub-seafloor depositional basin and replaced the marine carbonates by fluid-rock interaction (Fig. 13B). This is supported by the observation that the highest-grade ore samples contain the least preserved dolomite. Continued up-flow of metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids in the sub-seafloor led to the replacement of early-stage (stage 1) siderite and, ankerite by later-stage (stage 2) siderite, and ankerite. Replacement and veining are the dominant processes responsible for the formation of ore mineralization in this stage (Fig. 13B). Most of the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh sideritic and ankeritic mineralization were deposited during this main mineralization stage in relation to subsurface replacement processes in the host rocks, due to the favorable porosity and permeability conditions (Fig. 13B). Based on textural evidence, we conclude that there was no large time interval between stages 1 and 2, and propose that these two stages might have formed almost contemporaneously.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nThis paper presents geological, textural, fluid inclusions, and S isotope data from the deposits of the Delijan Fe mining district. The stratabound ores occur as replacement bodies within the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary (volcanic) rocks, as well as along major syn-sedimentary faults. The ore consists of ankerite and siderite with subordinate amounts of barite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite, and is associated with dolomite, quartz, and calcite alteration. Bedded ore facies including laminated and disseminated siderite (Sid 1) and ankerite (Ank 1) with host rock laminae suggested that the early stage of mineralization in the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits was syn-sedimentary to early diagenetic and formed on the seafloor. Massive-replacement ore facies and stringer zone siderite (Sid 2) and ankerite (Ank 2) associated with the lithology of host rocks provide unequivocal evidence of replacement as the most important process in the formation of the deposits from the Delijan Fe mining district. This latter stage (stage 2) of mineralization in the Kahak, Raveh, and Khoreh deposits formed at the sub-seafloor. The primary ore bodies, which are in the form of irregular veins, and lenses and include unreplaced host rock relics, are typically a result of replacement mineralization linked to the sub-seafloor hydrothermal processes. The ore-forming fluids were basinal brines with 7.8 to 16.8\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. salinities and the ore precipitation occurred under moderate temperatures between 162 and 210\u00a0\u00b0C. The sulfur isotope composition of barite minerals shows a wide range of values (+10.69 to\u00a0+\u00a031.98\u2030). These values reflect that the sulfate-rich brine has derived from the Lower Cretaceous seawater. The geological setting and mineral paragenesis of the deposits from the Delijan Fe mining district are comparable with most sub-seafloor replacement SEDEX-type deposits such as Mehdiabad, Mansourabad, and Farahabad in Central Iran and the Shamsabad and Ahangaran deposits in the MEMB. This model explains syngenetic-diagenetic mineralization events following host rock sedimentation during Lower Cretaceous basin evolution. Tectonic uplift and related faulting during post-primary carbonatic Fe mineralization deformation events played a role in the fracturing of host carbonates, facilitating the action of meteoric waters. Iron oxy-hydroxide gossans were derived from iron carbonate (siderite, ankerite, and ferroan dolomite) ore bodies by intensely supergene alteration and karstification processes.\n\n","23":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGold ores are generally associated with sulfide and sulfarsenide minerals in different kinds of hydrothermal gold deposits, including orogenic (e.g., Morey et al., 2008), Carlin (e.g., Bakken et al., 1989) and epithermal types (e.g., Griffin et al., 1991). Meanwhile, gold has commonly no genetic link with carbonate minerals, which are usually considered as post-ore and mineralization-unrelated (e.g., Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Lubben et al., 2012). Therefore, genetic study correlating siderite and gold precipitation is rarely conducted.\nGold precipitation is always attributed to the perturbance of physicochemical conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, oxygen fugacity) caused by fluid processes such as immiscibility or mixing (e.g., Heinrich et al., 1996), which would destabilize gold complexes in the fluid and cause the subsequent gold precipitation (Loucks and Mavrogenes, 1999; McCuaig and Campbell, 1998; Seward, 1973). However, the major controlling factors of gold precipitation associated with siderite and the differences from gold precipitation in sulfide are not clear.\nAt the Jiudian deposit (part of the world-class Jiaodong gold province), gold is closely associated with pyrite and siderite in the first and second ore stage, respectively, with the latter having higher gold grade. More importantly, the reason why gold precipitation is more efficient with siderite (compared with pyrite) is still poorly understood. We combined the mineral assemblage, quartz texture and fluid inclusion microthermometry, together with geochemical characteristics of pyrite and gold-dominant minerals (electrum or native gold) from the two ore stages to explore the uncommon and high-efficiency gold precipitation mechanism related to Fe carbonate at Jiudian.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Jiaodong peninsula is located in the southeastern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), and the southeastern\/western margin bounded by the Sulu ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt and the Tan-Lu fault zone (Fig. 1\na). The peninsula can be divided into the western Jiaobei terrane and the eastern Sulu terrane along the Wulian-Yantai fault zone (Zhou et al., 2008) (Fig. 1b). The Jiaobei terrane is composed of the Jiaobei Uplift in the north and the Jiaolai Basin in the south (Fig. 1b). In the Jiaobei Uplift (with the majority of gold resource of the gold province), outcropping rock units include the Precambrian metamorphic basement and Mesozoic intrusions (gold ore host). The gold province contains several super-large goldfields (e.g., the Sanshandao, Linglong, and Jiaojia). The Sulu terrane in the southeast consists predominantly of UHP metamorphic rocks and late Mesozoic granitoids, and the relatively few gold deposits are mainly distributed along the Muping-Rushan fault (Fig. 1b).\nPrecambrian metamorphic rocks are mainly distributed in the Jiaobei terrane, and include the Neoarchean Jiaodong Group, the Paleoproterozoic Jingshan and Fenzishan groups, and the Neoproterozoic Penglai Group (Fig. 1b). The Jiaodong Group is composed of biotite plagioclase gneiss, biotite granulite, plagioclase amphibolite, and tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneisses (amphibolite- to granulite-facies), and are mainly distributed in the Laizhou and Zhaoyuan districts. The SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages of leptites and TTG gneisses of the Jiaodong Group range from 2.9 to 2.7\u00a0Ga (Jahn et al, 2008). The Jingshan and Fenzishan groups overlying the Jiaodong Group were metamorphosed to granulite-facies at 2.2 to 1.9\u00a0Ga (Wan et al., 2006), and are mainly consisted of marble and schist with minor amphibolite (Dong et al.,2010). The Penglai Group is locally distributed in the Qixia district, and mainly consists of slate, quartzite and marble, with low greenschist-facies metamorphism (Faure et al., 2003).\nThe Mesozoic felsic intrusive rocks are widely emplaced in the Jiaobei Uplift (Fig. 1b) during in three episodes: (1) the Linglong granites emplaced into the Precambrian basement in the Late Jurassic (165\u2013150\u00a0Ma), composed of biotite granite and minor hornblende granite (Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2012); (2) the Guojialing granodiorite, consisting of monzonite, granodiorite and monzogranite, intruded into both the Linglong granite and the Precambrian basement in the middle Early Cretaceous (132\u2013123\u00a0Ma) (Hou et al., 2007); (3) in the late Early Cretaceous (120\u2013110\u00a0Ma), the Aishan granites were emplaced into both the Linglong and Guojialing granitoids in the northern margin of the Jiaobei Uplift (Goss et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). In addition, a large number of intermediate-mafic dikes (e.g., lamprophyre, diabase, and diorite) intruded into the Precambrian metamorphic rocks and the Mesozoic intrusions along NE- to NNE-striking faults during 130\u2013110\u00a0Ma (Li et al., 2016).\nMost gold deposits in the Jiaodong gold province are distributed along a series of NNE-NE-, EW- and NW-trending faults (Fig. 1b). The NNE- to NE-trending faults, which are considered as the secondary faults of the Tan-Lu fault zone, are the dominant ore-controlling structures in the district (Yang et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.2\nDeposit geology\nThe Jiudian gold deposit (>30\u00a0t Au @ 4.93\u00a0g\/t) as an important part of the Zhaoye metallogenic belt, located at the boundary between the Jiaobei Uplift and the Jiaolai Basin (Fig. 1b) (Li et al., 2015). Local exposed strata include amphibolite and biotite plagioclase gneiss of the Yetou Formation (Jingshan Group), which overlies the Jiaodong Group along an unconformity. The orebodies are hosted in the Cuizhao monzogranite of the Linglong granite complex. The Zhaoping fault is the largest and most important ore-controlling structure, and its NNE- to NE-trending secondary faults control the distribution of most ore veins (Fig. 2\n). Over 20 auriferous quartz veins have been discovered at Jiudian, among which the No. 1 vein as the largest lode is about 5\u00a0km-long, and its southwest section is where our samples were collected (Fig. 2). This lode strikes 20\u00b0-55\u00b0 and dips 60\u00b0-80\u00b0 NW. 11 orebodies have been identified in the No. 1 vein system, with the maximum length of 220\u00a0m. The gold grade ranges from 1.52 to 67.83\u00a0g\/t with an average of 4.57\u00a0g\/t (Jiang and Zhang, 2011; Li et al., 2015).\nAccording to crosscutting relationships and mineral assemblages, four mineralization stages can be distinguished: (I) pyrite-milky quartz, (II) pyrite-smoky grey quartz (the first ore stage), (III) quartz-siderite-polymetallic sulfide (the second ore stage), (IV) quartz-calcite-pyrite. The stage I milky quartz veins without gold mineralization contain abundant quartz and minor coarse-grained pyrite (Fig. 3\na\u2013c). Intense sericitization occurs along these quartz veins, and alteration assemblage contains sericite, quartz and minor pyrite. The stage II pyrite-smoky grey quartz veins crosscut the sericitization zone and stage I milky-white quartz veins (Fig. 3d\u2013f). These veins are strongly controlled by the NNE-trending fractures and its secondary fractures, with their widths ranging from several centimeters to tens of meters. The main minerals in these veins contain smoky-grey quartz and medium- to fine-grained pyrite with abundant mineral inclusions (i.e., galena, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and minor electrum). The pyrite grains are euhedral or subhedral with size ranging from 20 to 500\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 3f; Fig. 4\nc). Gold minerals (electrum and native gold) occur as microscale inclusions up to 50\u00a0\u03bcm, or as veinlets filling in pyrite microcracks, or interstitial between pyrite grains (Fig. 3f; Fig. 4c). At Jiudian, stage III siderite stockwork ores with higher gold grade are also important mining target. The mineral assemblage of this stage includes pyrite, siderite, quartz, marcasite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, magnetite, electrum and native gold (Fig. 3g\u2013i; Fig. 4d\u2013g). The post-ore stage IV calcite veins crosscut previously altered rock, and has no genetic relationship with gold mineralization (Fig. 3j and k). These quartz-calcite veinlets have minor medium- to fine-grained pyrite, chalcopyrite and magnetite with the grain size smaller than 100\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 3j\u2013l).\n\n\n\n3\nSamples and analytical methods\n\n3.1\nSample preparation\nRepresentative samples were collected from two different types of gold ores: Stage II quartz-pyrite and Stage III quartz-sulfide-siderite ore veins from the Jiudian No. 1 orebody (Fig. 3e and g; Fig. 4a and b). Ore samples were cut and polished into thin sections for microscopic observation, and then determine the site for cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, backscattered electron (BSE) imaging and Tescan Integrated Mineral Analyzer (TIMA) mineralogical phase analysis. Representative electrum and pyrite with appropriate grain size from the two ore stages were selected to obtain the electrum major element compositions and pyrite trace element compositions, using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), respectively. Fluid inclusion petrography, microthermometric and Raman spectroscopic analyses were also conducted for primary fluid inclusions in quartz from the two ore stages.\n\n\n3.2\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nCathodoluminescence (CL) images of quartz from the two ore stages were performed on a MIRA3 TESCAN field emission (FE)-SEM at the Guangzhou Tuoyan Analytical Technology Co. Ltd., prior to the fluid inclusion study. In addition, backscattered electron (BSE) images were also acquired on the samples. The acceleration voltage is 10\u00a0kV and the current is 1.2nA. The scanning was performed once every 80\u00a0s.\n\n\n3.3\nTIMA mineralogical phase analysis\nMineral compositional mapping was obtained on carbon-coated thin sections with a MIRA3 SEM equipped at the Guangzhou Tuoyan Analytical Technology Co. Ltd. The analysis used an acceleration voltage of 25\u00a0kV, probe current of 8.16nA. Working distance was set to 15\u00a0mm, pixel spacing to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm and dot spacing to 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm. The current and BSE signal intensity were calibrated on a platinum Faraday cup using the automated procedure. EDS performance was checked using a manganese standard. The samples were scanned using the TIMA liberation analysis module.\n\n\n3.4\nElectron probe microanalysis (EPMA)\nRepresentative polished sections were carbon-coated, and the major and minor element compositions of electrum (or native gold) from the two ore stages were determined at the Wuhan SampleSolution Analytical Technology Co. Ltd. (Wuhan, China). Quantitative spot analyses were performed on a JEOL JXA-8230 electron microprobe with a 20\u00a0kV accelerating voltage, 50nA beam current, and 1\u00a0\u03bcm beam diameter. The same condition was used for 48 spot analyses to determine the Au and Ag contents (with the detection limit of 211 and 85\u00a0ppm, respectively). Natural minerals were used as standards. Analytical procedures followed those described by Liu et al., (2015).\n\n\n3.5\nLA-ICP-MS trace element mapping\nTrace elements of pyrite from two ore stages were determined with a NWR 193\u00a0nm ArF Excimer laser-ablation system coupled to an iCAP RQ (ICPMS), at the Guangzhou Tuoyan Analytical Technology Co. Ltd. The ICPMS was tuned using NIST 610 standard glass to yield low oxide production rates. Helium carrier gas (0.7\u00a0l\/min) was mixed with 0.89\u00a0l\/min Ar make-up gas before entering the ICP. The laser fluence is 5\u00a0J\/cm2, with a repetition rate of 30\u00a0Hz and a 5\u00a0\u03bcm spot size. The laser scanning speed is 25\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. The raw isotope data were reduced with the \u201cTRACE ELEMENTS\u201d data reduction scheme (DRS). The DRS runs within the freeware IOLITE package of Paton et al. (2011). In IOLITE, user-defined time intervals were established for the baseline correction procedure to calculate the session-wide baseline-corrected values for each isotope. Blocks of two standards (NIST 610 and GSE-2G) and one MASS-1 sulfide standard analyses were analyzed after every 5 to 8 unknown samples. For pyrite, 12 isotopes were measured (with their respective dwell times in milliseconds listed in parentheses): 49Ti (5), 57Fe (5), 59Co (5), 60Ni (5), 65Cu (5), 75As (5), 77Se (5), 121Sb (5), 126Te (5), 197Au (5), 208Pb (5) and 209Bi (5) corresponding to a total dwell time of 60\u00a0ms. The MASS-1 sulfide standard (Fe\u00a0=\u00a015.6%; Wilson et al., 2002) was used as the primary standard for calibrating 57Fe (5), 59Co (5), 65Cu (5), 75As (5), 77Se (5), 121Sb (5), 126Te (5), 197Au (5), 208Pb (5) and 209Bi (5). Meanwhile, 49Ti (5), 60Ni (5) and 208Pb (5) were corrected by GSE-2G (7.55% Fe) synthetic basaltic glass standard, which was prepared using material developed by Meyers et al. (1976). All the isotopes were corrected with the internal standard of 57Fe (Fe\u00a0=\u00a046.6%).\n\n\n3.6\nMicrothermometry and Raman spectroscopy\nMicrothermometric measurement for fluid inclusions in representative stage II and III quartz grains were carried out on a Linkam THMSG 600 heating-cooling stage with measured temperature of \u2212196 to 550\u00a0\u00b0C, and a Leize microscope for observation at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The measurement precision is\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C at temperatures below 30\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C at temperatures above 30\u00a0\u00b0C. The heating and freezing rate was controlled within the range of 0.2 to 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C\/min, and decreased to 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C\/min near the phase transition.\nRaman spectra for determining the fluid inclusion compositions were obtained with a XPLORA PLUS visible micro confocal Raman spectrometer at the GIGCAS. The light source is 532\u00a0nm argon laser with 5mW output power and 5 to 8\u00a0s counting time. The counting time of some samples is appropriately extended. The laser beam spot size is about 1\u00a0\u00b5m, and the spectral resolution is 2\u00a0cm\u22121. Before the measurement, monocrystalline silicon (520.7\u00a0cm\u22121 Raman shift) was used as an internal standard. Raman spectra were acquired over the spectral range of 100\u20134000\u00a0cm\u22121.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nGold occurrence and compositions\nPyrite is the predominant host mineral of the visible gold in stage II auriferous quartz vein ores (avg. 4.16\u00a0g\/t Au; unpubl. report) (Fig. 3f; Fig. 4c). Fine gold grains (size: 1 to 37\u00a0\u03bcm) commonly occur either as irregular inclusions intergrown with galena, or as microfracture-infill in (or on the grain margin of) pyrite. While siderite is more closely associated with visible gold in stage III ores (avg. 13.51\u00a0g\/t Au; unpubl. report) (Fig. 4d\u2013g), with significantly coarser gold grains (size: 2 to 64\u00a0\u03bcm) distributed adjacent to the corroded margin of siderite and pyrite (\u00b1magnetite), as inclusions in siderite, or in the peripheral section of siderite veinlets (Fig. 4d\u2013g).\nThe analyzed gold grains from Jiudian show varying Au (66.08 to 84.12\u00a0wt%) and Ag (15.45 to 32.61\u00a0wt%) contents, but only two grains have Au contents over 80\u00a0wt% (Table 1\n; Fig. 5\n), which means gold commonly occurs as electrum (Hough et al., 2009). Electrum (Elt1) in the first ore stage pyrite has gold fineness ranging from 671.5 to 712.5 (avg. 691.3), significantly lower than that of electrum (Elt2) associated with the second ore stage III siderite (736.1 to 844.8, avg. 761.4) (Fig. 4c\u2013g; Fig. 5; Table 1).\n\n\n4.2\nMicrotextures of pyrite and quartz\nFrom optical microscopic observation and BSE imaging, euhedral-subhedral pyrites from the two ore stages are both characterized by the corrosion textures and occur as intergrowth with quartz and\/or siderite. The core of pyrite is porous and mineral inclusion-rich. The rim of pyrite commonly has rare or no pores and mineral inclusions. The core and rim are separated by relatively sharp boundaries (Fig. 6\na and d).\nGold and arsenic contents show positive correlation in pyrite from the first ore stage, whose core (Py1-cr) has low As-Au concentrations, while the highest As-Au concentrations occur within the rim (Py1) (Fig. 6b and c). By contrary, the As and Au have abnormal decoupling characteristics in pyrite from the second ore stage, corresponding to Au and As enrichment in the core (Py2-cr) and rim (Py2), respectively (Fig. 6e and f).\nAccording to the CL images, quartz from both stages shows heterogeneous internal texture, two generations were recognized in quartz from either stage (Qtz1-1, Qtz1-2; Qtz2-1, Qtz2-2) (Fig. 7\nc and f). The common texture characteristics of quartz from both ore stages are represented by the residual bright generation (Qtz1-1, Qtz2-1) surrounded and\/or crosscut by the dark generation (Qtz1-2, Qtz2-2) (Fig. 7c and f). The Qtz1-2 and Qtz2-2 show closer paragenetic relation with the pyrite and siderite, which is the main gold host in the first and second ore stage, respectively, while Qtz1-1 and Qtz2-1 represents the earlier crystalized phase (Fig. 4c\u2013g; Fig. 7a\u2013f).\n\n\n4.3\nFluid inclusions in quartz\nBased on their phase characteristics at room temperature and laser Raman spectroscopic results, five types of fluid inclusions were distinguished in quartz from two ore stages: Type 1 H2O-CO2-NaCl inclusions: consisting of liquid-rich (Type 1a) (Fig. 8\na, j\u2013o; Fig. 9\na), vapor-rich two phase (Type 1b) (Fig. 8b and l) and three phase inclusions (Type 1c) (Fig. 8c, k, l); Type 2 CO2 two-phase inclusions (Fig. 8d and k; Fig. 9b); Type 3 H2O-NaCl inclusions: consisting of Type 3a liquid-rich (Fig. e, n, o; Fig. 9f) and Type 3b vapor-rich two-phase (Fig. 8f and n); Type 4 H2O-CO2-CH4-NaCl inclusions: consisting of Type 4a liquid-rich (Fig. 8g, m, o; Fig. 9c) and Type 4b vapor-rich two-phase (Fig. 8h and o; Fig. 9d); Type 5 CO2-CH4 two-phase inclusions (Fig. 8i, n and o; Fig. 9e).\nMicrothermometric measurements for 122 fluid inclusions in different generations of quartz from two ore stages were conducted. The salinity and bulk composition of fluid inclusions were calculated using the software MacFlincor (Brown and Hagemann, 1995), based on the computer program of Bakker (2003). These results are listed in Table 2\n and described below.\nIn the bright core Qtz1-1, Type 1a aqueous-carbonic two-phase inclusions occur predominantly as clusters or along growth zone (Fig. 7c; Fig. 8j), which homogenized to liquid phase at 270 to 328\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10\na; Fig. 12). Based on the Raman spectroscopic results, CO2 with minor H2O is the dominant compound detected in vapor phase of Type 1 inclusions (Fig. 9a). The CO2 clathrate melting temperatures (Tmclath) range from 5.7 to 8.8\u00a0\u00b0C, with calculated salinities of 3.8 to 9.0\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. (Fig. 10b; Fig. 12). The mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) occur at 0.087\u20130.242 (Fig. 11\n\n).\nType 1a, b, c and Type 2 fluid inclusions occur together as assemblages in dark quartz Qtz1-2 (Fig. 7c; Fig. 8k and l). The homogenization temperatures of Type 1a, b inclusions vary from 240 to 303\u00a0\u00b0C, with the Tmclath and calculated salinities of 5.4\u20138.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 3.0\u20139.4\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv., respectively (Fig. 10a and b; Fig. 12). The melting temperatures of solid CO2 (TmCO2) of Type 1c three-phase aqueous-carbonic inclusions are close to \u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 2), indicating the carbonic phase of fluid system is basically composed of CO2 (Diamond, 2001). The CO2 clathrates melted at 6.9 to 9.1\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to salinities of 1.8 to 5.9\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. (Fig. 10b; Fig. 12). The liquid CO2 and vapor CO2 in Type 1c inclusions partially homogenized to liquid or vapor phase at 28.2\u201330.6\u00a0\u00b0C (ThCO2), while the total homogenization temperatures (Thtot) of 306 to 363\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10a; Fig. 12). The calculated XCO2 of Type 1c inclusions occurs at 0.269 to 0.698 (Fig. 11). Type 2 inclusions have ThCO2 of 28.8 to 30.4\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 2).\nThe bright core of quartz from Qtz2-1 mainly contains Type 4a and minor Type 1a fluid inclusions (Fig. 7f; Fig. 8m). Type 4a inclusions have homogenization temperatures from 275 to 344\u00a0\u00b0C and higher Tmchath between 10.4 and 13.2\u00a0\u00b0C than that of Type 1 H2O-CO2-NaCl inclusions (<10\u00a0\u00b0C), indicating the existence of CH4 in the fluid, as confirmed by the laser Raman spectroscopic results (Fig. 9c; Fig. 10c; Fig. 12). Several Type 1a inclusions (with no CH4) have lower Tmclath of 1.8\u20133.2\u00a0\u00b0C, with calculated salinities of 11.6 to 13.4\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv., and homogenization temperatures of 319\u2013337\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10c, d a; Fig. 12).\nType 3 to 5 inclusions with varying vapor phase volumetric proportions commonly coexist within the same clusters in dark rim Qtz2-2 (Fig. 7f; Fig. 8n and o). Type 3 inclusions have Tmice of \u22125.8 to \u22121.3\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to salinities of 2.1\u20139.0\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv., and Thtot of 183 to 269\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10c and d; Fig. 12). Type 4 inclusions have Tmchath ranging from 10.8 to 13.4\u00a0\u00b0C, and Thtot between 208 and 290\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10c; Fig. 12). The homogenization temperatures of Type 5 vapor-phase inclusions (23.5\u201329.3\u00a0\u00b0C) (Table 2) are lower than those of Type 2 inclusions, which also indicate the coexisting of CH4 with CO2, which was determined by laser Raman spectroscopic results (Fig. 9e).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nPrecipitation mechanism of gold in the first ore stage\nEarly bright Qtz1-1 from the first ore stage was precipitated from the H2O-CO2-NaCl fluid system, with higher temperature and lower salinity than the fluid environment when dark Qtz1-2 was formed. Qtz1-2 shows closer paragenetic relationship with pyrite (Fig. 7a\u2013c; Fig. 10a and b; Fig. 12), suggesting that it may be more representative of the first ore-fluid product. Type 1 two-phase fluid inclusions with varying vapor phase proportions and similar homogenization temperatures (240 to 303\u00a0\u00b0C) coexist with Type 1c three-phase and Type 2 pure CO2 inclusions within the same plane or clusters in Qtz1-2 (Fig. 7c; Fig. 8k and l; Fig. 12), implying the occurrence of fluid immiscibility (Diamond, 2001; Ramboz et al., 1982). The salinity of Type 1a inclusions is higher than that of Type 1c inclusions (Fig. 10b; Fig. 12), attributed to the preferential distribution of dissolved salt to aqueous end-member of the unmixing fluid (Trommsdorff and Skippen, 1986). Homogenization temperature data (Thtot) of fluid inclusions in Qtz1-2 are considered as a function of mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) constitute a possible H2O-CO2 solvus (Fig. 11), also confirming the occurrence of trapped immiscible fluid, i.e., when the temperature of original fluid dropped (Type 1c), fluid immiscibility occurred with Type 1a and Type 2 inclusions representing aqueous and carbonic end-member fluid, respectively (Fig. 11; Velasquez et al., 2014). Furthermore, the CO2 homogenization temperatures (ThCO2) of Type 1c three-phase aqueous-carbonic inclusions are similar to those of Type 2 carbonic inclusions (Table 2), also consistent with fluid immiscibility (Olsen, 1988).\nThe ore-forming fluid contains CO2 as a fluid pH buffer, maintaining enhanced gold concentrations in solution, thereby fluid can transport sufficient gold (Phillips and Evans, 2004). The CO2-rich ore fluid is common in many gold deposits at Jiaodong, which may be released from the dehydration and devolatilization from deep mantle reservoir (e.g., Deng et al., 2015; Mao et al., 2008). Fluid immiscibility would lead to H2S escape from the ore-forming fluid, causing the destabilization of Au (HS)2\u2212 which is the main complex transporting gold in hydrothermal solution under the conditions of low temperature, low salinity and high \u03b1H2S (Pokrovski et al., 2009; Williams-Jones et al., 2009), eventually triggering gold precipitation (Mikucki, 1998). Thus, fluid phase separation or immiscibility may have been the dominant gold precipitation mechanism of gold precipitation in the first ore stage, which is consistent with other quartz-vein type gold deposits in the Jiaodong gold province (e.g., Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015), and many orogenic lode-gold and epithermal Au deposits worldwide (e.g., Huston and Large, 1989).\n\n\n5.2\nHigh-efficiency gold precipitation associated with Fe carbonate\nBased on the mineral assemblage characteristics, the dark rim of quartz from the second ore stage (Qtz2-2) was regarded as the product which can better characterize the ore-forming fluid with respect to the bright core (Qtz2-1), for the same reason discussed in the previous section. Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in Qtz2-1, which represents the initiation of the second ore stage, are similar to those from the first ore stage (Fig. 10a, c; Fig. 12). Together with the presence of CH4 in the fluid, this indicates a new and relatively reducing fluid in the second ore stage rather than the evolved ore fluid.\n\nThe residual bright core Qtz2-1 was precipitated from the NaCl-CO2-CH4-H2O dominated hydrothermal system with higher temperatures and salinities, whereas the peripheral dark generation Qtz2-2 contains Type 3 aqueous inclusions with low homogenization temperatures and salinities (Fig. 10c and d; Fig. 12), which were probably trapped along with mixing of an external cold fluid, corresponding to the Th-salinity mixing tendency in the second ore stage (Fig. 12). Furthermore, the oxygen fugacity of the ore-forming fluid increased, evidenced by the presence of magnetite (Fig. 4g), thus the mixed oxidized low-temperature fluid may be the meteoric water. The rapid drop of pressure and temperature caused by the fracturing of the ore-controlling faults during seismic activity and mixing with the cold fluid may have triggered fluid immiscibility (or boiling), as evidenced by Type 1, 3, 4 inclusions with distinct vapor\/liquid ratios and salinities but similar homogenization temperatures, coexisting with Type 5 CO2-CH4 inclusions within the same clusters (Fig. 7f; Fig. 8n and o; Fig. 12; Craw et al., 1993; Diamond, 2001). In addition, several base metals (e.g., Cu, Pb, Zn) that are predominantly transported in chloride complexes would be precipitated as polysulfides (e.g., chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite; Fig. 3g\u2013i), triggered by fluid cooling (Brugger et al., 2016; Reed and Palandri, 2006; Zhong et al., 2015).\nMoreover, the mixing with oxidized meteoric water would result in fluid oxidation, consistent with the presence of magnetite in the second ore stage (Fig. 4g). Subsequently, partial oxidization, dissolution of pre-existing pyrite and precipitation of marcasite occurred via the following reactions (Fig. 3i; Fig. 4d) (Eqs. (1) to (4)) (Goldhaber et al., 1978; Schieber, 2007).\n\n(1)\n\n\nFe\n\nS\n\n2\n\n\n\n\npyrite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n3.5\n\nO\n2\n\n+\n\nH\n2\n\nO\n=\nF\n\ne\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n2\n\nH\n+\n\n+\n2\nS\n\nO\n4\n\n2\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n2\nF\ne\n\nS\n\n2\n\n\n\n\npyrite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n3.5\n\nO\n2\n\n+\n3\n\nH\n2\n\nO\n=\n2\nF\ne\nO\n\n\n\n\n\nOH\n\n\n\n\n+\n4\n\nH\n+\n\n+\n\n4\n\nS\n2\n\n\nO\n3\n\n2\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nn\n\nH\n+\n\n+\n\nn\n\nS\n2\n\n\nO\n3\n\n2\n-\n\n\n+\n\n2\n\nH\n2\n\nS\n=\n2\n\nH\n2\n\n\nS\nn\n\n+\nn\nH\nS\n\nO\n3\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nF\n\ne\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\nH\n2\n\n\nS\nn\n\n=\nF\ne\n\nS\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nmarcasite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\nS\n\nn\n-\n2\n\n0\n\n+\n2\n\nH\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese reactions may have led to the extensive consumption of O2, combined with the escape of H2S resulted from fluid immiscibility, so that pre-existing pyrite would be replaced by siderite via the following reaction (Fig. 3i; Fig. 4d\u2013g) (Eq. (5)) (Hu et al., 2020).\n\n(5)\n\n\n2\nF\ne\n\nS\n2\n\n+\n2\nC\n\nO\n2\n\n+\n4\n\nH\n2\n\nO\n=\n2\nF\ne\nC\n\nO\n3\n\n+\n4\n\nH\n2\n\nS\n+\n\nO\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction consumed (Eq. (5)) vast amount of CO2, as supported by the weakening of CO2 peak in the Raman results of fluid inclusions from the second ore stage (Fig. 9a\u2013d). Subsequently, the fluid pressure decreased dramatically, which further promoted the degree of fluid immiscibility. The H2S degassing caused by fluid unmixing would enhance the metasomatic reaction (Eq. [5]) in turn, and eventually a positive circulation formed between fluid immiscibility and replacement reaction. Furthermore, the consumption of CO2 would lead to the decrease in the capacity of ore solution containing gold (Phillips and Evans, 2004).\nThe above-mentioned mineral phase transformation reactions would produce a more acidic fluid environment due to vast H2S replenishment into the ore-forming fluid via the extensive siderite metasomatism (Eq. (5)), which was conductive to the stable existence of marcasite (Murowchick and Barnes, 1986). In addition, the decreasing pH may be the main factor for the increasing gold fineness in electrum from the first to the second ore stage (Fig. 4c\u2013g; Fig. 5) (Gammons and Williams-Jones, 1995; Pal'yanova, 2008), since the ratios of the concentrations of dissolved gold and silver in hydrothermal fluid only increase with the decrease of pH under the condition that pH is not extremely low or high (Liang and Hoshino, 2015), which is consistent with the weakly acidic ore fluid at Jiaodong (e.g., Li et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2017). Furthermore, the addition of CH4 into the hydrothermal system of the second ore stage could cause significant enlargement of the immiscibility field of CO2-H2O system, which also plays a critical role in enhancing immiscibility and mineralization (Naden and Shepherd, 1989). Elevated fluid immiscibility would break the equilibrium between minerals and fluid, then create an extremely disequilibrium fluid environment (e.g., Heinrich et al., 1996). Pyrite from the second ore stage is characterized by the decoupling of Au and As, which also indicates that it was crystallized under disequilibrium condition (Fig. 6e and f; Wu et al., 2021), which is distinctive from the more prevailing situation occurring in the first ore stage that the incorporation of Au into pyrite is controlled by the As content (Fig. 6b and c; Deditius et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2005).\nThe chain circuit correspond to the mutual promotion between mineral phase transformation processes and fluid immiscibility would result in the extreme disequilibrium of ore-fluid system, accompanied by systematic disturbance of the physicochemical conditions (including temperature, pressure, pH, and oxygen fugacity), which would trigger polymetallic sulfide deposition, and more importantly, the siderite formation with high-efficiency gold precipitation may have formed the stage III high-grade ores at Jiudian.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nTwo gold ore stages were identified in the Jiudian gold deposit, in which gold is closely associated with pyrite and siderite, respectively. The stage III siderite ore has higher gold grade, indicating more efficient gold precipitation.\n\n\n(2)\nFluid inclusions petrographic and microthermometric results suggest that Stage II pyrite-related gold deposition may be attributed to fluid immiscibility, consistent with many quartz-vein type gold deposits in the Jiaodong district.\n\n\n(3)\nThe incorporation of CH4 and similar homogenization temperatures of the ore-forming fluid indicate that the second ore stage may have been an independent event from the previous ore stage.\n\n\n(4)\nIn the second gold ore stage, the dramatic decompression during seismic activity and the mixing of the reduced hydrothermal fluid with the oxidized low-temperature meteoric water may have caused fluid immiscibility (boiling) and oxidation. Subsequently, the successive transformation from pyrite to marcasite and siderite had constructed a positive cycle of mutual promotion with fluid unmixing which was also enhanced by the existence of CH4. Therefore, an extremely turbulent and disequilibrated fluid environment was produced, which not only allowed high-efficiency gold precipitation associated with siderite formation, but also promoted the deposition of other base metals.\n\n\n\n\n","24":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nWith the discovery in 2007 of a group of conduit-hosted chromite deposits of world-class grade and size in the Ring of Fire ultramafic to mafic intrusive suite in northern Ontario (Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020), Canada joined the ranks of major potential suppliers of chromium to global markets. The Esker intrusive complex (EIC), part of the broader Ring of Fire intrusive suite, is located in the central part of the McFaulds Lake greenstone belt and is subdivided into at least two contemporaneous intrusions, the Black Thor intrusion (BTI) and Double Eagle intrusion (DEI; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2017, 2019, 2020a; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020), and contain major deposits of chromite (Burgess et al., 2012; Murahwi et al., 2012; Murahwi and Spooner, 2015; Aubut, 2015). Unlike typical conduit-hosted chromite deposits, the EIC is spatially associated with a significant resource of magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfides, the Eagle's Nest deposit (Mungall et al., 2010; Burgess et al., 2012; Metsaranta et al., 2015; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2017, 2019, 2020a; Zuccarelli et al., 2020, 2022), marking only the second such occurrence in the world next to the Uitkomst Complex, South Africa (Gauert, 2001). The EIC has undergone regional metamorphism to greenschist facies mineral assemblages along with folding and faulting, so it is now nearly vertically inclined and most of its original extent is either concealed or missing due to erosion (Metsaranta et al., 2015; Carson et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020). Our 3D modeling allows us to reconstruct a vertical section through the intrusive complex from interpreted feeder dikes and the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit, hosting magmatic sulfide mineralization, through ultramafic sills containing chromitite layers to an overlying layered mafic intrusion containing the potentially very large but poorly defined Thunderbird Fe-Ti-V magnetitite prospect (Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020).\nGlobal chromium production is almost exclusively from igneous chromitite deposits including podiform and stratiform types (e.g., Stowe, 1994; Cawthorn et al., 2005). Podiform chromitites occur in the mantle section of ophiolite complexes (e.g., Kempirsai deposit, Kazakhstan: Melcher et al., 1999; Distler et al., 2008). Stratiform chromitites are characterized by chromitite layers, with a typical thicknesses of\u00a0\u2264\u00a02\u00a0m, which can be traced over strike lengths of up to hundreds of km (e.g., Cameron, 1964; Cousins and Feringa, 1964; Scoon and Teigler, 1994). Global chromium production and reserves are dominated by the stratiform chromitites of the Rustenburg Layered Suite of the Bushveld Complex of South Africa (United States Geological Survey, 2021). A few authors (Prendergast, 2008; Mungall 2014; Lesher et al., 2019) have suggested the addition of conduit-hosted chromitites as a subset of stratiform chromitites. In this context, the term \u201cconduit\u201d is used to describe elongate bodies filled with komatiite- or boninite-associated ultramafic cumulates with bulk compositions too refractory to represent differentiated liquids. The liquids from which the cumulates were deposited have left the system and the observed body has therefore served as a conduit for magma which is no longer present. Although this argument must even be applied to the stratiform chromitites of the Bushveld and Stillwater complexes (Arndt, 2005; Mungall et al., 2016; Jenkins and Mungall, 2018), we reserve the term \u201cconduit-hosted\u201d for chromium mineralization occurring as relatively irregular layers and lenses up to tens of m in thickness within km-scale sill-like ultramafic intrusions (e.g., Sukinda, India: Mondal et al., 2006; Inyala-Railway Block, Zimbabwe: Prendergast, 2008; Ipueira-Medrado, Brazil: Marques et al., 2016; Black Thor, Canada: Carson et al., 2015; Lesher et al., 2019; Uitkomst, South Africa: Maier et al., 2004, 2018). Whereas the essential structural configuration of podiform chromitites is well established at a range of scales (Distler et al., 2008), and the structure of the giant stratiform deposits of the Bushveld is, by definition, quite straightforward, there is relatively little information publicly available regarding the structural configuration of conduit-hosted stratiform chromitites worldwide. Many of these have all been illustrated with schematic sections but their detailed 3D geometry is not well documented in the published literature.\nAlthough chromitites are commonly anomalously enriched in platinum-group elements (PGE) and are sometimes associated with important PGE-rich chromitite horizons like the UG-2 in the Bushveld Complex, most chromitite deposits are mined solely for chromium (e.g., Mungall and Naldrett, 2008). There are few examples of base-metal magmatic sulfides with clear associations to chromitite, the most notable example being the Nkomati Mine in the Uitkomst Complex, which is a conduit-hosted chromitite deposit underlain by a magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposit temporally and spatially associated with the Bushveld Complex (Gauert et al., 1995; Wabo et al., 2016). The roughly coeval subeconomic Ni and Cr mineralization of the 2742\u20132744\u00a0Ma Bird River intrusive suite (Timmins et al., 1985; Theyer, 1991; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2015), occurs in a similar tectonic setting as the EIC, both lying on the rifted margins of the Neoarchean microcontinent called the North Caribou superterrane (Percival et al., 2006; Mungall et al., 2010).\nOur paper presents a 3D model of the EIC of the Ring of Fire intrusive suite, to provide better insight into the subsurface architecture of conduit-hosted stratiform chromitite deposits and their ultramafic\u2013mafic host intrusions. Our 3D modeling, constrained by closely spaced exploration drillholes, was performed at both regional and local scales in order to capture the geometry of structures including lithostratigraphic contacts, faults and shear zones, as well as forms of chromitite horizons hosted within the ultramafic rocks of the complex. Unraveling the original architecture of this intrusive complex sheds light on the spatial relationship between sulfide mineralization and the rest of the larger magmatic plumbing system. Furthermore, the modeled spatial relationships between ore zones and the ultramafic host rocks provide some insights regarding the origin of chromite mineralization in the EIC. Importantly, our 3D model and its interpretations should provide useful guidelines for interpreting the genesis of other chromite deposits and their associated sulfide mineralization.\n\n\n2\nGeological Setting\nThe Ring of Fire intrusive suite is a significant meta-igneous component of the McFaulds Lake greenstone belt, a\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0km-long arcuate-shaped belt composed of metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks including silicate- and oxide-facies iron formation. This ultramafic to mafic suite intruded into 2773.4\u00a0\u00b1 0.9\u00a0Ma foliated tonalite to granodiorite and older supracrustal successions of the McFaulds Lake greenstone belt (e.g., Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020; Figs. 1 and 2\n\n). Bedrock in this area belongs to the Oxford-Stull domain of the North Caribou superterrane in the Archean Superior province (Thurston et al., 1991; Rayner and Stott, 2005; Percival et al., 2006; Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020). Most of the central portion of this arcuate-shaped greenstone belt, referred to as the Muketei assemblage (e.g., Metsaranta et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020), consists of dominantly mafic and felsic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks, associated clastic metasediments and iron formation. Dating of the lower part of this assemblage near the EIC is poorly constrained, with only a couple ages ranging from ca. 2734 to 2737\u00a0Ma for the uppermost volcanic rocks in the sequence near the McFaulds Lake volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (Rayner and Stott, 2005; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020). The southwest portion of the Muketei assemblage in the study area is separated from the adjacent Victory assemblage, which comprises a mafic to intermediate metavolcanic succession, by the regionally extensive McFaulds Lake shear zone (MFSZ; Metsaranta et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020; Fig. 2). The McFaulds Lake greenstone belt was intruded by Neoarchean ultramafic\u2013mafic rocks (2734.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma; Mungall et al., 2010; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a), defined as the Ring of Fire intrusive suite (Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta et al., 2015; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2015; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a). These rocks, possibly emplaced through the invasion of rift-related fault structures, intruded both the older felsic rocks and the overlying Muketei assemblage, apparently following the contact between the tonalite and overlying metavolcanic rocks (Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020).\nThe EIC, part of the Ring of Fire intrusive suite, includes two distinct ultramafic-dominated intrusions, the BTI and DEI, which host a number of major chromite deposits (e.g., Black Thor, Black Label, Big Daddy, Black Horse, Blackbird and Black Creek; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2017, 2019, 2020a; Fig. 2) providing geological resources totalling approximately 343 Mt at 32% Cr2O3 for the entire area (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2020 and references therein). The BTI and the DEI are interpreted to have been fed by distinct magmatic conduits (Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a). Both intrusions are composed predominantly of a thick lower ultramafic series and thinner mafic upper series (Fig. 3\n). The ultramafic series consist of dunite, peridotite (harzburgite), pyroxenite and chromite metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies. Dunite and peridotite lithologies are composed predominantly of serpentinized or talc-replaced olivine (75\u201395%). Magnetite is ubiquitous, occurring as a fine dusting of magnetite throughout, as well as on the periphery of chromite grains, due to serpentinization (Azar, 2010; Carson et al., 2013; 2015). These rocks also exhibit locally extensive talc-carbonate (i.e., magnesite) alteration. The pyroxenite consists primarily of orthopyroxene that is locally altered to a very soft talc schist with post-kinematic tremolite and some chlorite (Azar, 2010; Carson et al., 2013, 2015). Associated chromitite occurs in a variety of mineralization styles (e.g., very thinly laminated to very thickly bedded, lightly to heavily disseminated, and interbedded massive to semi-massive chromite) typically within intervals of dunite and peridotite (Azar, 2010; Carson et al., 2015; Spath, 2017). In contrast, the overlying mafic series consists of gabbroic rocks with local melagabbro or leucogabbroic layers and lesser anorthosite that have undergone some alteration to typical greenschist assemblages including chlorite, tremolite, and epidote-group minerals (Fig. 3; Carson et al., 2015; Azar and Ferguson, 2012). The ferrogabbroic intrusions occurring in the study area (Fig. 2) comprise layered, locally magnetite- and ilmenite-rich gabbro grading into magnetitite, anorthosite, anorthositic gabbro, and rare pyroxenite (Metsaranta et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a), partially to completely replaced by the same greenschist mineral assemblage. The ultramafic\u2013mafic intrusions and their metasedimentary and metavolcanic host rocks are underlain by medium-grained granodiorite-tonalite (2772.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 and 2773\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma; Mungall et al., 2010; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a, 2020) that has undergone minor sericite-epidote-chlorite alteration. Due to its location in the Hudson Bay lowlands, the study area is almost entirely covered with muskeg (i.e., raised peat bogs) with very few bedrock exposures. As a result, 3D geological modeling was exclusively constrained by industry drillhole and airborne geophysical data.\n\n2.1\nDouble Eagle Intrusion\nThe DEI is an ultramafic sill-like body that occupies the contact between the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks to the south and the tonalite to the north (Fig. 2). While the lower ultramafic portions of the DEI to the northwest are transected by a ductile shear zone called the Frank shear zone (FSZ), the upper contact against the supracrustal rocks appears to be intrusive, although it is roughly coincident with the McFaulds Lake shear zone (MFSZ), at its southern most boundary. The general sequence in the DEI ultramafic sill is from serpentinized dunite at the north to talc-carbonate schist replacing pyroxenite at the south. The Blackbird chromite deposit (Fig. 2) comprises a series of overturned and steeply dipping chromitite lenses within the main dunite sequence that are inferred to young to the east (Azar, 2010). Chromitite occurs as massive lenticular bodies up to 50\u00a0m thick, flanked by zones of intercalated layers of chromitite and dunite with variable modal abundances of disseminated chromite.\nThe Eagle's Nest magmatic Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide deposit (Fig. 2), in the hanging wall of the FSZ, occurs in a moderately to weakly differentiated intrusion composed of harzburgite, lherzolite, pyroxenite and some gabbro, tentatively interpreted to have served as the magmatic conduit that fed the ultramafic sill which hosts the Blackbird and Black Horse chromite deposits in the DEI (Mungall et al., 2010; Murahwi et al., 2012). The mineralization of the Eagle\u2019s Nest deposit, similar to that observed in the AT-12 feeder of the BTI (Mungall, 2009; Mungall et al., 2010; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a), consists of bodies of massive, disseminated and net-textured sulfide minerals (e.g., pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite) and magnetite that form sheets extending approximately 200\u00a0m in strike length and up to 50\u00a0m in thickness to a depth of >1600\u00a0m (e.g., Mungall et al., 2010; Zuccarelli et al., 2017, 2020). The deposit accumulated in a sub-horizontal keel structure at the base of a chonolith and has been subsequently tilted to form a blade-shaped body plunging subvertically to a depth\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0km with a present north\u2013south strike length of about 500\u00a0m (Mungall et al., 2010; Zuccarelli et al., 2017, 2018, 2022). Mineralization is generally confined to the northern and western margins of the peridotite host dike (Mungall et al., 2010; Zuccarelli et al., 2017, 2018, 2022). The peridotite dike is closed at its northern and southern ends and, despite some local deformation, the body is not significantly deformed and most contacts remain intact in their original relations with the host rocks (Mungall et al., 2010; Zuccarelli et al., 2022).\n\n\n2.2\nBlack Thor Intrusion\nThe ultramafic series of the BTI trends southwest to northeast and is slightly overturned with sub-vertical dips ranging between 70\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 northwest (Carson et al., 2013; Laarman, 2014). It can be divided into lower, middle and an upper series (Fig. 3: Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a): 1) the lower series consists of interlayered dunite and lherzolite with minor olivine websterite and hosts at its top the stratiform Black Label chromitite horizon; 2) the middle series consists of sequences of interlayered dunite, lherzolite and websterite, capped by the thicker Black Thor stratiform chromitite horizon; and 3) the upper ultramafic series consists of sequences of lherzolite, websterite, feldspathic websterite and olivine websterite. The overlying mafic series, comprising sequences of melagabbro, gabbro, leucogabbro and minor anorthosite (Carson et al., 2015), is separated from the upper ultramafic series by a major northeast trending shear zone called the 3B shear zone (3BSZ; Fig. 2). Although the 3BSZ commonly is observed to overprint the contact between the ultramafic and mafic portions of the BTI, Carson et al. (2015) observed that this lithological boundary is preserved locally as a primary and gradational igneous contact.\nRocks of the lower and middle ultramafic series of the BTI were cut by the extensive Late Websterite intrusive phase, which is inferred to have been emplaced via the AT-12 feeder dike (Spath et al., 2015; Spath, 2017). The Late Websterite phase, composed predominantly of websterite and lesser feldspathic websterite, is largely localized within the AT-12 feeder zone and basal peridotite. However, it also intruded the lower dunitic zones and the lower Black Label chromitite horizon, causing some local brecciation of the BTI ultramafic units (Spath et al., 2013; Spath, 2017). The bulk of the chromite mineralization within the BTI is confined to the Black Thor horizon. The Black Creek and Big Daddy deposits occur along strike to the southwest and are interpreted as part of the middle ultramafic series and therefore correlative with the Black Thor deposit (Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a). These stratiform chromitiferous zones are characterized by numerous layers of varying mineralization styles (e.g., very thinly laminated to very thickly bedded, lightly to heavily disseminated, and interbedded massive to semi-massive chromite) within layered ultramafic sequences dominated by dunite and peridotite (Carson et al., 2015; Spath, 2017). The Black Thor deposit extends approximately 3\u00a0km in length, followed by the Black Label deposit at 1.5\u00a0km in length (e.g., Carson et al., 2015). Individual chromitite layers in the Black Thor deposit and central parts of the Black Label deposit appear to be thickest and lenticular in the center of the intrusion above the inferred feeder zone. With increasing distance from the feeder zone, individual chromite layers become thinner and more sheet-like, and therefore become difficult to correlate along strike (Carson et al., 2015).\nMinor Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralization within the BTI occurs predominantly in the lower ultramafic series and includes multiple generations and styles (e.g., Farhangi et al., 2013; Carson et al., 2015; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2015, 2017, 2020a): 1) early magmatic sulfide-rich conduit-style mineralization within the feeder at Blue Jay (Fig. 2); 2) sulfide-rich contact-style mineralization along the basal contact of the intrusion and at Blue Jay; 3) magmatic sulfide-rich reef style PGE-rich mineralization within the chromitite horizons; 4) sulfide-rich disseminated stratiform PGE-poor mineralization in fractionated gabbroic rocks of the mafic zone; 5) late magmatic sulfide-rich mineralization within the brecciated parts of the Black Label horizon, and NW breccia zone associated with the slightly younger websteritic phase; and 6) tectonically\/hydrothermally mobilized local sulfide-rich mineralization along the 3BSZ between the upper ultramafic and mafic series.\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThe methodology for generating the 3D model of the EIC was based on a workflow of sequential data compilation and modeling steps as presented on Fig. 4\n. First, a harmonized database was compiled from the drillhole archives of the different exploration companies to facilitate regional-scale 2D structural interpretations and 3D geological modeling. A subset of drillhole intervals was selected from this database and examined on site in the Esker mine camp to collect subsurface constraints for modeling the key intrusive and stratigraphic contacts, as well as the shear zones that dissect the EIC. Second, near-surface drillhole intervals extracted from the drillhole database were integrated with proprietary high-resolution airborne magnetic data to produce a new interpretation of lithostratigraphic units and structures in the study area based on the latest published geological map (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a). The inferred lithostratigraphic contacts and structures of this updated geological map compilation provided constraints for constructing the 3D model in addition to the drillhole data. Third and fourth, 3D-modeled surfaces, defining contacts between the igneous and supracrustal units, as well as the shear zones and faults displacing them, were modeled using the GOCAD\/SKUA\u00ae structure and stratigraphy workflow. This workflow employs the discrete smooth interpolation (DSI) algorithm (Mallet, 1992) to fit triangulated surfaces to the geological unit contacts and drillhole markers. Fifth, the chromitite zones, hosted within the EIC, were also modeled using DSI by fitting 3D triangulated surfaces to pre-defined ranges in Cr2O3 assay data. Assay analyses for Cr2O3 in 1\u20132\u00a0m drill core intervals were obtained using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analyses (INAA) from 2006 to 2008 and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) starting in 2009 (Aubut, 2015 and references therein). Sixth, the 3D geological model was refined to correct for over smoothing by minimizing deviations of the 3D-modeled surfaces from drillhole constraints, particularly to accommodate for the complexly-shaped basal intrusive contact of the EIC and associated magmatic conduits. The forthcoming sections provide more details for each of these six steps.\n\n3.1\nDrillhole database compilation (Step 1)\nDrillhole data compiled from proprietary datasets acquired over the course of 10\u00a0years of exploration and a regional re-logging campaign (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017d) was harmonized and systematically encoded into a relational database to establish regional lithostratigraphic correlation. Exploration drilling was conducted using standard wireline diamond coring methods by several different contractors. Casing was left in all holes to facilitate location and surveying. Collar locations were surveyed using a Trimble\u00ae GPS Pathfinder\u00ae with a Zephyr\u2122 antenna having an accuracy of 20\u00a0cm. Holes were surveyed first by Reflex EZ-Shot\u2122 to find dip and azimuth every 50\u00a0m down hole using a magnetic survey. Holes with highly magnetic host rocks were resurveyed using a Reflex\u2122 multishot gyroscope or Devico DeviFlex\u2122 instrument (Golder Associates, 2010; Aubut, 2015; Weston et al., 2014). Records from approximately 1700 drillholes, (originally stored in MS Excel\u00ae workbooks) were organized into multiple thematic tables in a MS Access\u00ae relational database. These themes included: 1) lithology, 2) lithostratigraphy, 3) mineralization indicating the presence\/absence of Ni-Cu-(PGE) and Cr-(PGE) forming minerals and Cr, Cu and Fe assays, 4) presence or absence of alteration minerals and 5) structural features (e.g., banding, magmatic layering, bedding, contact, fault, foliation, shear zone, etc.). The drill log thematic data were linked to their corresponding collar coordinates and deviation log tables, based on their collar identification (ID), to facilitate import and multi-thematic 3D drillhole visualization. Descriptive drillhole lithology logs were encoded into lithostratigraphic units according to the legend of the latest geological map compilation of the study area (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a). This allowed for establishing laterally persistent drillhole correlation of lithostratigraphic units in three dimensions to unravel and model the subsurface geological structure of the intrusive complex. Fig. 5\n shows the distribution of these lithostratigraphicdrillholelogs with 3D-modeled surfaces of the EIC and shear zones.\n\n\n3.2\n2D interpretation of lithostratigraphic contacts, shear zones and faults (Step 2)\nThe 2D geological map interpretation (Fig. 2) and refinement of the latest published geological map was generated by the integrated interpretation of near-surface lithostratigraphic drillhole intervals and the total field magnetic intensity and 1st vertical derivative grids of a proprietary high-resolution three-axis gradiometer magnetic survey. The survey was flown in June 2014 by helicopter at a flight line spacing of 75\u00a0m and nominal terrain clearance of 30\u00a0m. Gradients G-north, G-east, and G-down were calculated from data acquired by four Scintrex\u2122 CS-3 cesium sensors positioned in an orthogonal array with 3\u00a0m sensor spacing. These gradient channels were together with the total field channel of the nose sensor, corrected for diurnal and altitude variations and subsequently levelled using a control line spacing of 1500\u00a0m. After eliminating the cultural noise produced by the infrastructure of the Esker exploration camp, a proprietary gradient tensor gridding algorithm was employed to generate the total field magnetic grid using a 10\u00a0m cell size. This total field magnetic grid was used to generate 1st vertical, horizontal gradient and tilt derivative magnetic grids (Scott Hogg and Associates Ltd., 2014). Interpretation of the 1st vertical derivative magnetic grid was of particular value, as it provided optimal enhancement of near-surface magnetic sources that allowed extending the interpretation underneath muskeg cover. Benefitting from the higher spatial resolution of the proprietary magnetic data, the outlines of the ultramafic and gabbroic intrusive rock units of the published geological map compiled from medium-resolution magnetic data (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a) were slightly modified. The interpretation of the branching shear zones, however, was modified significantly. Distinct curvilinear magnetic lows on the map of the 1st vertical derivative of the residual total magnetic field in combination with near-surface drillhole intervals of sheared rock (phyllonite\/schist in ultramafic and mylonite in felsic protoliths) better elucidated the alignment of high-strain zones (Fig. 6\n). Furthermore, lower magnetic susceptibilities in physical rock property logs of sheared ultramafic talc-carbonate schist and phyllonite corroborated the relationship between curvilinear magnetic lows and ductile shears, a relationship which has been explained by alteration and breakdown of magnetite to Fe-sulfides and\/or Fe-carbonate in ultramafic rocks elsewhere (Airo, 2002). The regional structures, outlined on Fig. 6, comprise three major shear zones: the Frank shear zone (FSZ), the 3B shear zone (3BSZ) branching off from the former at a triple junction, and the McFaulds shear zone (MFSZ) transecting the Muketei assemblage and tonalite south of the DEI (Laudadio et al., 2018; Laudadio, 2019, Figs. 2 and 6). In addition to these shear zones, three minor brittle faults (BF-1, BF-2, BF-3) are inferred within the BTI that offset the magnetic anomaly pattern of the ultramafic intrusions at high angles (Figs. 2 and 6).\n\n\n3.3\n3D geological modeling (Steps 3 and 4)\n3D triangulated surfaces were fitted to tops of drillhole intervals and their corresponding lithostratigraphic contacts and structures at surface, which in combination with user-defined topological relationships between stratigraphic horizons and fault surfaces, resulted in a seamless volumetric representation of lithostratigaphic units and fault blocks. First, a 3D network of triangulated surfaces (Fig. 7a\n) representing the main shear zones and faults was constructed (Table 1\n) in which each modeled structure was constrained by its mapped surface trace (obtained in step 2), and where existent, by aligned phyllonite\/mylonite drillhole intervals. This step of the structural and stratigraphic workflow produced a seamless fault network that partitioned the studied 3D volume into distinct fault blocks (Fig. 7b). Note that the 3BSZ was omitted from the fault network modeling. This is because the 3BSZ transposes the ultramafic-gabbro contact along its entire trace, hence leaving its displacement estimate unconstrained. The northwest-southeast trending minor brittle faults (BF-1 to BF-3) were, considering their limited strike extent and offsets, modeled as dying faults with displacements terminating at their tips. Once the 3D fault network was complete, contacts between the main intrusive and supracrustal units were modeled in the same manner as the fault structures (i.e., fitting 3D triangulated surfaces to drillhole markers and corresponding surface traces; Table 1). This modeling step included computation of the fault displacement of the lithostratigraphic contacts, as defined by their projections on the interface (i.e., the modeled fault or shear zone) between two adjacent fault blocks.\n\n\n3.4\n3D modeling of the chromite horizons (Step 5)\nThis step of the modeling workflow consisted of modeling the chromite deposits hosted within the BTI and DEI. Azar (2010) and Carson et al. (2015) found that individual chromitite layers could not be correlated easily in the Blackbird, and the Black Thor and Black Label deposits, respectively. Moreover, inconsistencies existed between classified mineralization types from the log descriptions of different exploration companies. In view of these limitations, Cr2O3 assay data was used to group individual chromitite layers into massive, and intercalated sequences in dunite\/peridotite. These sequences are based on the average ranges of percent Cr2O3 measured for various styles of chromite mineralization in the Black Creek and Big Daddy deposits but characteristic of all the other known chomite deposits (Murahwi and Spooner, 2015; Aubut, 2015). Zones of dominantly massive chromite were defined by the\u00a0\u2265\u00a035% Cr2O3 threshold, while intercalated sequences were defined by the\u00a0\u2265\u00a015% to\u00a0\u2264\u00a035% Cr2O3 percentage range. These classification boundaries separated subpopulations in the histogram of grade distribution (not shown) and provided a generalized continuous 3D representation of chromitite mineralization parallel to the igneous layering. Using DSI, 3D triangulated surfaces were subsequently fitted to these boundary constraints to create a series of discrete smooth surfaces representing the upper and lower boundaries of the massive and intercalated chromitite layers of the BTI and DEI.\n\n\n3.5\nIterative model refinement (Step 6)\nThe 3D triangulated surfaces generated in steps 3 and 4 provided a reasonable first-order fit to the available drillhole and 2D map constraints. However, iterative local refinement was required, particularly for the geometrically complex magmatic conduits and keel structures at the base of the EIC. The closed geometry of the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit was modeled using the SURFE algorithm \u2013 Surface Estimator, an open source implicit algorithm which automatically calculates a 3D model surface from a range of geological observation types such as stratigraphic on-contact and off-contact point observations, as well as planar and linear structural constraints (https:\/\/github.com\/MichaelHillier\/surfe#readme, Hillier et al., 2016; Hillier et al., 2014). The SURFE algorithm first computed a 3D signed distance function from nodes postponed on and off the granodiorite-ultramafic lithological contacts and subsequently traced the zero-distance surface from the interpolated 3D scalar distance field. The keel structures, on the other hand, were modeled in two steps using DSI. First, the keels were modeled separately, by fitting surfaces to map and drillhole nodes of the intrusive contacts that define their lobate shape. The nodes of these local surfaces, in turn, defined DSI constraints for modifying the over-smoothed shape of the planar intrusive contact between the EIC and the granodiorite-tonalite rocks (Fig. 2). Additional adaptations to the regional-scale 3D model were made by manually editing the position of individual nodes of the triangulated surfaces, to adjust for minor mismatches between the 3D model and data constraints.\n\n\n3.6\nLimitations of the 3D model\nAlthough the 3D model was intended to elucidate the subsurface architecture of the EIC, generalization was unavoidable due to the regional scale of the project and the clustered and sparsely-distributed drillhole data in some sections of the EIC (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is important to note that the ultramafic portions of the DEI and BTI were generalized and modeled as a distinct volume of intrusive ultramafic rocks, not to be interpreted as a homogeneous intrusion derived from a single magma pulse. Furthermore, the concentration of exploration drilling along ore horizons within the ultramafic portions of the layered intrusion leaves some surfaces much better constrained than others (Table 1). Nevertheless, the generally conformable geometry of the EIC and host rock envelope, established by the laterally persistent correlation of contacts between ultramafic intrusive rock, and felsic intrusive and supracrustal rocks, leans favourably to an interpretation that supports the modeling of poorly constrained surfaces as conformable with those that are densely constrained.\nBecause the GOCAD\/SKUA\u00ae structure and stratigraphy workflow computes the offsets between interpolations of a lithostratigraphic horizon in distinct fault blocks, shear zones in this workflow are inherently represented as discrete structures. Hence, shear zones are assumed to have accommodated ductile flow by simple shear (no volume change) along a high strain zone of infinitesimal width. As a result, any additional pure shear component of the strain history that could have reduced the thickness of the shear zone was assumed to be a negligible component. Given the relatively narrow width of the heterogeneous shear zones (1\u201330\u00a0m width for high strain zones within a total shear zone width range of 30\u2013150\u00a0m) with respect to the average thickness of the intrusive complex (about 1.5\u00a0km), the effects of shear zone deformation on the gross geometry of the intrusive complex are considered negligible to small.\nOn account of the generalized binary classification of chromitite mineralization into massive and intercalated types, it is important to note that individual horizons of massive chromitite in the 3D model do not represent a single layer of massive to semi-massive chromitite but rather a package of massive chromitite and chromite-rich cumulate layers that are correlated along strike owing to their similar compositions and stratigraphic positioning. Additionally, in instances where hole-to-hole correlations of massive chromitite intervals could not be established with confidence, the intervals in question were amalgamated into the adjacent intercalated layers. It is also important to recognize that within the intercalated sequences, no distinction was made between uniformly disseminated chromite and intercalated thin layers of chromitite and dunite. Since disseminated chromite may suffer from metamorphic overgrowths of magnetite that make it unsuitable for smelting, these domains would require more detailed examination for local structural and textural features before they could be used in modeling of a mineral resource (Barnes, 2000). The modeling of intercalated and massive chromitite horizons was limited to areas where intervals of massive chromitite could be confidently correlated between drillholes. Furthermore, the resulting geometries of each chromitite horizon were left open at depth because the distribution of exploration drillholes fails to fully constrain many of the massive and intercalated chromitite zones in both intrusions. Thus, the ore zones may be more continuous with larger lateral dimensions than what is implied by the 3D-modeled surfaces.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nThe completed 3D geological model, spanning about 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024.5\u00a0km to a depth of 1.6\u00a0km, comprises 12 3D-modeled surfaces representing the lithostratigraphic contacts and tectonic structures that define the internal geometry of the DEI and BTI and their surrounding host rocks (Figs. 7 and 8a\n). The interpretation of this 3D geometry, and the spatial relationships of structures and lithological units within the DEI and BTI, provides important insights into the original architecture of the EIC. This activity has also shed some light on the spatial distribution of sulfide mineralization within the magmatic plumbing system. Furthermore, the detailed geometry of the chromitite ore horizons was examined to provide a better understanding of the spatial relationships between the chromite mineralization and the ultramafic host rocks.\n\n4.1\nFault network and host-rock geometry\nThe 3D geological model of the EIC generally supports the 2D geological map interpretation of the area (Metsaranta et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a, 2020). However, locally the geological map pattern defining the top surface of the 3D model differs significantly from the previously published map interpretation. Particularly, the geometry of the shear zones and the relative displacements accommodated by these structures needed to be adapted based on drill logs and the high-resolution aeromagnetic data. Note that both the DEI and BTI are transected by a composite zone of ductile southwest-northeast trending shear zones. The FSZ (Fig. 2 and 8a-c) dipping 60\u00b0 to the northwest, is interpreted as one of the main tectonic structures accommodating displacement of lithological units and ore zones within the DEI. To the southwest, this shear zone transects the granodiorite of the foliated tonalitic to granodiorite suite (Fig. 9a\n) and then follows the contact between this unit and the talcose peridotite (Fig. 9b) of the DEI. Drill core observations indicate that in this area, the high strain zone extends for several tens of meters into both units with protomylonite and occasional mylonite fabrics in tonalite and phyllonite and talc-carbonate schist in peridotite. The variations in thickness and strain intensity of these sheared intervals, of which the highest strain zones with mylonite and phyllonite fabrics have a maximum thickness of 30\u00a0m, suggest that the FSZ is heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, examination of the FSZ along this granodiorite-peridotite contact in the DEI resulted in the identification of a prominent mineral lineation within the granodiorite indicating reverse displacement (north over south) along the shear zone (Mungall, 2009). Toward the northeast, the FSZ juxtaposes the lobate intrusive ultramafic units (AT-1, AT-5, and C-6) in the hanging wall with the upper gabbroic sequence of the DEI in the footwall (Fig. 2 and 8a-c). The blade-shaped section of the ultramafic unit in the hanging wall furthest to the southwest hosts the Eagle\u2019s Nest deposit, which is interpreted as one of the feeders of the layered DEI (Mungall et al., 2010). High-density drilling within the DEI has left the FSZ well-constrained between the Blackbird 1 and Black Horse chromite deposits, whereas sparser drilling confirms the presence of the shear zone up to 1\u00a0km northeast of Black Horse, just south of AT-5 (Figs. 2 and 8c). Farther toward the northeast, the FSZ transects the gabbro, mafic-dominated volcanic host rocks and ferrogabbro intrusions that structurally overlie the ultramafic lower part of the DEI (Fig. 2). Limited drill log descriptions and drill core observations indicate that the same lithostratigraphic sequence (ultramafic\u2013mafic-metavolcanic-ferrogabbro-tonalite) identified in both the DEI and BTI, also exists as thinner intervals in between the two intrusions. More importantly, this data reveals the presence of a 30\u00a0m drill core interval of highly sheared talc-rich ultramafic schist, characteristic of the FSZ, located roughly 1\u00a0km west of the triple junction. East of Eagle\u2019s Nest, the FSZ and the 3BSZ (the northeast-southwest striking shear zone transecting the BTI) overprint the contact between the ultramafic and mafic intrusive phases (Figs. 2 and 8a). These high strain zones are localized in the ultramafic rocks in the structural hanging wall of this contact and are in drill core characterized by 30\u2013100\u00a0m intervals of sheared talc-carbonate schist and 10\u201320\u00a0m intervals of phyllonite. This suggests that these shear zones may have originally formed a single continuous structure, inferred to be offset by an ENE-trending splay branching off from the FSZ at a triple junction (Figs. 2 and 10b, c\n).\nIn contrast to the strongly sheared upper ultramafic\u2013mafic contact in the BTI, the irregular shape of the intrusive ultramafic-granodiorite contact at the base of the BTI (Fig. 11a\n) and the preservation of sharp contacts between undeformed chilled serpentinized peridotite and granodiorite in drill core at this location, suggests that the primary intrusive basal contact of the layered intrusion is largely intact. The opposite relations hold in the southwestern portion of the DEI, where the ultramafic-granodiorite contact near Blackbird 1 coincides with the trace of the FSZ, and the primary upper DEI contact is mostly preserved.\nThe MFSZ, identified as the strong northeast trending curvilinear magnetic low southwest of Blackbird 2, is another regionally-significant structure of the McFaulds greenstone belt (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a). The MFSZ partly follows the contact between the intrusive ultramafic rocks of the DEI and the mafic-dominated volcanic unit (Fig. 2) adjacent to the Blackbird 2 chromite deposit. Drill core observations show that the MFSZ steps north\/south away from the intrusive contact with strongly-developed shear fabrics in felsic volcanic intervals (Fig. 9c, d) within the mafic-dominated volcanic units (Fig. 9e). These felsic rocks appear to have acted as preferential zones of weakness during shear zone deformation. Farther east-northeast, the MFSZ transects the mafic-dominated volcanic rocks, ferrogabbro intrusion and synvolcanic tonalite. Furthermore, along the southwestern margin of the DEI, sequences of bimodal metavolcanic rocks are present on either side of the MFSZ (Figs. 2 and 9c) which is interpreted as the juxtaposition of the younger Muketei assemblage (ca. 2737\u20132734\u00a0Ma) with the older rocks of the Victory assemblage (ca. 2783\u20132780\u00a0Ma; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a, 2020). A single U-Pb zircon date of 2782.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0Ma from a sheared felsic interval within the bimodal metavolcanics provides evidence for this relationship (Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a, 2020). Previously, the subsurface location of this interval with respect to the MFSZ was unclear, but the 3D geological model confirms its location just south of the shear zone (Fig. 8c) corroborating previous interpretations that the MFSZ is in fact a regional scale tectonic structure that juxtaposed the Victory assemblage against the younger rocks of the Muketei assemblage along the southern margin of the EIC (Metsaranta et al., 2015; Metsaranta and Houl\u00e9, 2017a, 2020).\nIn addition to these major shear zones, a series of late-stage northwest-southeast striking brittle faults with minor offsets of 100\u2013200\u00a0m, displace sections of the BTI (BF-1, BF-2, and BF-3; Figs. 2, 6, and 8a). These faults exhibit steeply dipping parallel geometries with sinistral apparent offsets and are not interpreted to be regionally extensive on the high-resolution magnetic data.\n\n\n4.2\nSulfide mineralization\nVisualization of assay data with the modeled Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit (Fig. 12a\n), indicates that sulfide mineralization is concentrated along the north-northwestern margin (interpreted to have been the original basal edge) of the conduit, confirming previous observations by Mungall et al., (2010) and Zuccarelli et al., (2017, 2020, 2022). Similar to the blade-like dikes of the Raglan South \u2013 Expo intrusive suite, the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit is therefore interpreted to have been a blade-shaped dike with a vertical intermediate axis at the time of emplacement (Mungall et al., 2010; Barnes and Mungall, 2018). Despite the extensive local deformation observed along drillhole intervals, preservation of chilled margins on both sides of the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit suggests that the primary intrusive contact remains intact (Mungall et al., 2010). At depth, drillhole constraints indicate narrowing of the conduit but its termination remains to be mapped out in detail (Fig. 8b) and it is thought to be truncated at depth by the FSZ. It is therefore likely that the conduit and the Eagle\u2019s Nest deposit have been displaced to an undetermined location within the footwall.\nApproximately 10\u00a0km northeast of the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit is the Blue Jay sulfide occurrence located in the northernmost tip of the downward AT-12 dike-like keel structure along the northern margin of the BTI (Fig. 8a, 11a, and 12b). Similar to the Jinchuan (ca. 831.8\u00a0Ma; Chai and Naldrett, 1992; Li et al., 2005) and Huangshandong (ca. 0.28\u00a0Ga; Han et al., 2004; Barnes and Mungall, 2018) intrusions in north-central and western China, respectively, the geometry of the dike-like keel that hosts Blue Jay is interpreted to reflect the widening of a feeder dike into the overlying intrusion (Mungall, 2009; Spath et al., 2015; Spath, 2017; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2019, 2020a). Though drillhole markers indicate that the granodiorite-ultramafic contact on either side of AT-12 is close to vertical at depth, exploration drilling has only constrained this geometry to a depth of 352\u00a0m. As a result, its 3D subsurface geometry below this point may not be accurately represented. However, considering the dike-like nature of the feeder, it is possible that it does not pinch out and that higher-grade sulfide mineralization lies deeper within the structure.\n\n\n4.3\nChromite mineralization\n\n4.3.1\nBlack Thor intrusion\nIn the BTI, chromite mineralization is hosted by the Big Daddy, Black Creek, Black Thor, and Black Label deposits (Fig. 13a\n). The Black Label chromitite zone, confined to the middle ultramafic series roughly 900\u00a0m above the AT-12 feeder dike, contains intercalations of very thinly laminated to very thickly bedded layers of lightly disseminated to massive chromite (Mehrmanesh et al., 2013; Spath, 2017). Hole-to-hole correlations of these intervals, however, were difficult to establish due to brecciation of the Black Label chromitite zone by the Late Websterite phase, particularly in the core of the complex. As a result, the Black Label chromitite zone was delineated in 3D as a broad zone of intercalated chromitite within dunite\/peridotite extending roughly 1.3\u00a0km along strike with a maximum thickness of 150\u00a0m (Fig. 13a).\nApproximately 200\u00a0m to the southwest and overlying the Black Label chromitite zone are a number of chromitite zones that comprise, from northeast to southwest, the Black Thor, Black Creek and Big Daddy chromite deposits. Conformable with the upper stratigraphic contact of their host intrusion, these chromitite horizons are semi-continuous and can be broadly correlated for up to 5\u00a0km along strike within the upper ultramafic series of the BTI. These horizons exhibit similar orientations striking northeast-southwest with steep dips ranging from 81\u00b0 NW to 65\u00b0 SE (Fig. 13a). Discontinuities present between chromitite horizons of each deposit, emphasized by a lack of exploration drilling, spatially correspond with the three northwest-southeast trending brittle faults referred to as BF-1, BF-2, and BF-3 (Figs. 2, 8a and 13a).\nThe Black Thor chromitite zone is the most extensive deposit, spanning a strike length of approximately 2.25\u00a0km with an observed thickness of up to 100\u00a0m. This deposit is defined by four successive bodies of massive chromitite (horizons BT-A through BT-D; Fig. 13b) separated and underlain by sequences of intercalated chromite in dunite\/peridotite and overlain by sequences of pyroxenite and peridotite. Correlated down dip to depths of at least 595\u00a0m, these chromite horizons bifurcate along strike (horizons BT-C and BT-D; Fig. 13b, c) splitting into two parallel seams divided by thin lenticular intervals of heavily disseminated chromite in dunite and peridotite. The discontinuities that separate the individual lenses of massive chromite horizons appear to show sinistral offset of the chromitite horizons (Fig. 13c). To the southwest, horizon D terminates, truncated by a brittle fault (BF-3; Fig. 13a). Assay data does not indicate the immediate continuation of the horizon on the other side of the fault. However, approximately 300\u00a0m southwest of Black Thor, mineralization continues in the Black Creek deposit, followed by the Big Daddy deposit, roughly 400\u00a0m southwest of Black Creek (Fig. 13a).\nThe Black Creek deposit comprises zones of massive chromitite enveloped by intercalated chromitite in dunite\/peridotite that can be correlated along strike for up to 600\u00a0m, pinching out to the northeast and thickening to the southwest (Fig. 13d). The deposit is host to a Main chromitite horizon (Fig. 13d), as well as a Secondary and Intermediate zone; these zones were too thin to be represented in the model and are therefore generalized as part of the surrounding intercalated rock. A thinner seam of massive chromitite is present at depth, lying stratigraphically above the main horizon and to the southwest. Although exploration drilling failed to constrain the geometry of the horizon up to the adjacent brittle fault (BF-2) to the southwest, it is likely that the horizon continues along strike until truncated by the brittle fault.\nThe Big Daddy chromitite (Fig. 13e) consists of two horizons of massive chromitite (BD-A and BD-B); a smaller horizon about 300\u00a0m long that pinches out to the northeast and southwest, and a larger overlying horizon correlated roughly 1\u00a0km along strike and 390\u00a0m at depth. This main horizon is underlain by a conformable layer of intercalated chromitite in dunite\/peridotite and overlain by pyroxenite. To the southwest, a brittle fault (BF-1) cuts this horizon and chromitite on either side of the fault exhibit sinistral offsets.\nThe sinistral apparent sense of displacement observed within the Black Thor zone (Fig. 13c) appears to be analogous with that observed along the larger brittle faults within the BTI that separate the Black Thor, Black Creek, and Big Daddy deposits. Dip variations observed for chromitite horizons from one fault block to the next may support the interpretation that this series of steeply dipping, northwest-southeast trending parallel brittle faults is the product of late stage extensional imbricate or \u201cbookshelf\u201d faulting (Ferrill et al., 1998).\n\n\n4.3.2\nDouble Eagle intrusion\nThe ultramafic series of the DEI, hosting the Blackbird 1, Blackbird 2, and Black Horse chromite deposits, is composed primarily of serpentinized and talc-altered peridotite and dunite. Confined to the northwestern most edge of the complex, just south of the FSZ, lies the Blackbird 1 deposit (Fig. 14a, b\n). It consists of a single lens-shaped body of massive chromite approximately 25\u00a0m thick, and dipping 67\u00b0 northwest to a depth of 520\u00a0m. Visualization of the Cr2O3 assay data in 3D space indicates that the horizon is closed off at both its northern and southern ends as well as at depth. As exploration drilling fails to constrain the upper portion of Blackbird 1, the horizon was modeled as an enclosed volume. The presence of a short spatial wavelength positive gravity anomaly (Mungall, 2009), however, suggests that the dense chromitite of Blackbird 1 that was encountered at depth may continue to where it is truncated by the erosional surface where bedrock meets the overburden. It was the recognition of this shallow gravity anomaly that guided the discoveries of the Blackbird 2, located\u00a0\u223c\u00a0750\u00a0m east of Blackbird 1, and Black Thor deposits, which also occur under similar short wavelength highs in the Bouguer anomaly (Balch et al., 2010) and were initially drill-tested on this assumption.\nOverlain by thin sequences of talc-altered pyroxenite, the Blackbird 2 chromitite runs parallel to the ultramafic\u2013mafic intrusive contact and consists of two massive chromite horizons (BB2-A and BB2-B, dipping 76\u00b0 NW and 75\u00b0 NW, respectively), aligned in the same northeast-southwest strike plane (Fig. 14a). Closer inspection of the assay data revealed the presence of a very thin (\u223c2 m) layer of massive chromitite that appears to connect both Blackbird 2 horizons (BB2-A and BB2-B; Fig. 14b). However, this thin chromitite layer is too narrow to plot at the scale of our modeling and is therefore not represented in the 3D model. Additionally, between Blackbird 1 and Blackbird 2 there are three seemingly distinct layers of intercalated chromitite within the talc-altered peridotite. These intercalated layers, though somewhat irregular in form, share similar orientations to the Blackbird 2 horizons (Fig. 14a, b). While the assay data does not indicate the termination of the intercalated layers or the Blackbird 2 horizons at depth, it does suggest that they become thinner with increased vertical extent.\nThe Black Horse chromite deposit lies below a depth of approximately 295\u00a0m within the footwall of the FSZ (Fig. 14a, b). Of the several drillholes that intersect Black Horse only four were assayed for Cr2O3 despite having intersected tens of meters of chromitite, leaving the model of this deposit poorly constrained. Down dip, the horizon appears to bifurcate into two horizons of massive chromitite increasing in thickness at depth. Despite having limited dip extent, the 3D visualization of Cr2O3 assay data indicates that the Black Horse chromitite rakes up towards Blackbird 2 (BB2-A) in the form of a thin, continuous \u201cbelt\u201d shaped layer running parallel to the FSZ (Fig. 14b; Aubut, 2015). Although exploration drilling has left this area poorly constrained, the presence of this thin intercalated layer and the spatial alignment of the Blackbird 2 and Black Horse chromitite (Fig. 14b) suggest that these horizons are probably connected along strike (Aubut, 2015).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nReconstruction of the structural evolution\nConsidering the interpretations of the locations of the major structural units and the surfaces that separate them, a better understanding of the original relationship between the BTI and DEI was attained through restoring the apparent dextral displacement along the FSZ evident in the regional-scale map (Fig. 2) and magnetic anomaly patterns (Fig. 6). The 3D model in this area shows steeply-plunging projections of the gabbro-bimodal (felsic-mafic) metavolcanic and bimodal (felsic-mafic) metavolcanic-ferrogabbro contacts in the footwall and their continuation in the hanging wall (Fig. 10a) that after a horizontal translation of 1.5\u00a0km provided re-alignment to model the EIC as a spatially-coherent unit. This displacement is consistent with that observed in the map pattern to the southwest where reversal of this 1\u00a0km offset along the FSZ in the DEI realigns the granodiorite-ultramafic contact in the hanging wall with its continuation in the footwall (Fig. 10b). Whereas the restoration is attainable via horizontal displacement, Mungall (2009) indicated a reverse sense of shear displacement along the FSZ as recorded by ductile fabrics in the surrounding tonalitic rocks Consequently, if it is assumed that the movement accommodated by the FSZ was single-stage with a dominant reverse sense of motion, the true displacement must have been significantly larger (in the order of several kilometers, assuming pitch angles\u00a0<\u00a030\u00b0 between the dip and displacement directions in the shear plane). This interpretation is, given the confined width and discontinuous high-strain zones in tonalite, dominantly characterized by protomylonite, not considered favourable. Instead, a multi-stage movement history of smaller displacements is preferred, in which the dip-lineated fabrics in tonalite were formed at an early stage of deformation when the ultramafic rocks remained rigid, prior to serpentinization and late strike-slip movement. Textural observations of the fabrics observed in the ultramafic serpentine-talc-carbonate schist and phyllonite, combined with map-scale deflection of this fabric into the shear zone, would date the timing of the lateral displacement to have followed the greenschist-facies hydrous alteration of the ultramafic rocks. This model would also account for the re-alignment of the FSZ and 3BSZ into a single structure (Fig. 10c) that would have predominantly accommodated the early reverse displacement along the tonalite-ultramafic and ultramafic-gabbro contacts, although the magnitude of this displacement cannot be estimated. Due to the lack of oriented drill core, it has not been possible to acquire sufficient kinematic indicators to test the multi-stage movement hypothesis. Follow-up kinematic drill core studies by measuring the 3D orientation of the shear plane and vorticity vectors associated with shear sense indictors will be required to fully resolve the movement history of the FSZ and 3BSZ, as well as the MFSZ that displaced but did not internally deform the EIC.\nThe 3D reconstruction resulted in a model in which the DEI and BTI are connected by relatively smooth, continuous planar surfaces of ultramafic\u2013mafic rocks (Fig. 11a, b). The offset observed in the DEI and near the Y-shaped triple junction has realigned the intrusive contacts to match in both locations and the lobate ultramafic rocks (AT-1, AT-5, and C-6) in the DEI that were juxtaposed against the gabbro are now positioned adjacent to the ultramafic portions in the footwall. This restoration, although lacking the dip-slip displacement component, is consistent with the conceptual model proposed by Houl\u00e9 et al., (2019, 2020a), that both intrusions, at a certain stage of the magmatic history, coalesced to form the larger EIC.\nBy returning the tilted geometry of the restored complex to its approximate original stratigraphic orientation, the boat-shaped structure of the ultramafic sills is emphasized with downward dike-like keels (Fig. 11b, c; Tuchscherer et al., 2010; Carson et al., 2015; Spath et al., 2015; Spath, 2017; Barnes and Mungall, 2018; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a), specifically within the BTI. The presence of thinner sequences of ultramafic\u2013mafic intervals between the DEI and BTI could be the result of pinching and swelling during ductile deformation along the FSZ or may record thinning of the intrusions away from their central feeders at Eagle\u2019s Nest and AT-12, respectively.\n\n\n5.2\nOrigin of sulfide mineralization\nSimilar to most economic grade Ni-Cu-(PGE) deposits around the world (e.g., Voisey\u2019s Bay, Noril\u2019sk, Jinchuan, Shurugwi; Naldrett, 1997; Naldrett and Lightfoot, 1999; Li et al., 2001; Maier et al., 2001; Prendergast, 2008), the majority of the sulfide mineralization associated with the DEI and BTI is primarily hosted in what appear to be magma conduits of the plumbing system, within the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit (Mungall et al., 2010; Zuccarelli et al., 2017, 2022; Zuccarelli, 2020) and the Blue Jay prospect of the AT-12 keel (Mungall, 2009; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2015, 2020a) respectively, as opposed to the overlying layered intrusions. Sulfide segregation and therefore mineralization within magmatic plumbing systems (as well as at the base of komatiite flows) is attributed to the contamination of the S-undersaturated komatiitic magma achieved through the assimilation of sulfur-rich country rock (e.g., Lesher and Groves, 1986; Spandler et al., 2005; Naldrett, 2010; Mungall et al., 2010; Song et al., 2011). Evidence for the assimilation of country rock in the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit is present along its southern margin where thermal and thermomechanical erosion has led to stoping of the conduit roof and preferential widening of the side walls (Barnes and Mungall, 2018; Barnes et al., 2015; Zuccarelli et al., 2022) and in the occurrence of numerous xenoliths within the chilled margins along the western and eastern contacts. Previous workers proposed that the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit and AT-12 dike form the feeders to the overlying intrusive units of the DEI and BTI respectively (e.g., Mungall et al., 2010; Murahwi et al., 2012; Carson et al., 2015; Spath, 2017). However, Houl\u00e9 et al. (2020a) and Zuccarelli et al. (2022) raised some questions regarding this direct spatial connection between the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit and the DEI due to the lack of distinct olivine-rich units and chromite mineralization in the former and relatively insignificant Ni-Cu sulfide mineralization in the latter, suggesting that they may represent separate intrusions within the same complex. Both scenarios are consistent with the 3D-modeled surfaces generated in this study (Fig. 8b and 11c), and neither possibility can be excluded. The occurrence of sulfides within these dike\/conduit structures, and along the base of the intrusion, likely resulted from accumulation of dense sulfide along the base of the blade-shaped dike in its original subhorizontal orientation (Barnes and Mungall, 2018; Fig. 12a, b). Our 3D modeling results suggest that these feeders were emplaced at high angles to the main intrusive body sharing very similar geometry to each other. Considering that steeply dipping, dikes similar to the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit and AT-12 typically occur in parallel swarms during the intrusion of magma into rift zones (Rubin and Pollard, 1988), it is possible that additional conduits contributed to the formation of the EIC (Houl\u00e9 et al., 2019, 2020a). Just northeast of Eagle\u2019s Nest, three irregular-shaped ultramafic lobes or keel-like structures (AT-1, AT-5, and C-6) define the basal contact of the complex within granodiorite host rocks of the footwall (Fig. 8b and 11c). While the modeled subsurface structure of C-6 is not confirmed by the widely spaced exploration drilling, AT-5 is constrained by a few drillholes. These drillholes intersected adcumulate to mesocumulate peridotite containing 4\u20136\u00a0mm olivine grains and variable amounts of intercumulus material typical of conduits and closely resembling the Eagle\u2019s Nest host dike but entirely lacking in sulfide mineralization (Mungall, 2009; Mungall et al., 2010). Moreover, when comparing the 3D subsurface geometry and surficial expression of these keel-like structures with those observed for Eagle\u2019s Nest and AT-12, their analogous shape and orientation suggest that Eagle\u2019s Nest, AT-1, AT-5, and C-6 represent a system of magmatic conduits with the potential to host additional Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralization at depth (Fig. 11b, c).\n\n\n5.3\nEmplacement of the complex\nThe Ring of Fire intrusive suite was interpreted by Mungall et al. (2010) to have been emplaced when a mantle plume came up beneath the North Caribou superterrane microcontinent and spread out, generating komatiites under thinner lithosphere along the continental slopes. In this interpretation, rifting occurred long before the mineralizing event, although the structures guiding the intrusions may represent reactivated normal faults related to the original rifting event. Importantly, the age distribution of mafic to ultramafic intrusions across the North Caribou superterrane, including those of the Ring of Fire intrusive suite and the Bird River intrusive suite, supports that initial interpretation proposed by Mungall and co-workers (Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020b). The hypothesis that magma preferentially invaded sub-parallel fractures in the wall rock along these deep structures, greatly influencing the shape of the intruding bodies (Delaney et al., 1986; Rubin and Pollard, 1988; Song et al., 2011; Barnes et al., 2015; Barnes and Mungall, 2018), may provide a plausible explanation for the parallel orientation of dike-like feeder conduits within the DEI and BTI. Eagle\u2019s Nest, AT-1, AT-5, C-6, and AT-12 appear to be emplaced laterally along the same northeast-southwest strike plane (Fig. 2) and may represent the upper crustal portion of a deeper sill-dike complex (Barnes et al., 2015). Additionally, the geometry of the ultramafic unit in the DEI shows minor vertical offsets along the basal contact where the walls of interpreted feeder dikes (i.e., AT-1, AT-5, and C-6) widen into the overlying intrusion (arrows in Fig. 11b, c), suggesting that these regional fracture planes were reactivated during magma emplacement. Furthermore, the existence of igneous breccias within the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit (Fig. 9f), including the occurrence of angular autoliths of mineralized peridotite and stoped blocks of tonalite in peridotite matrix suggests that brittle faulting accompanied the emplacement of the intrusion (Mungall et al., 2010).\nConsidering the reconstructed geometry of the DEI and BTI (Figs. 10, 11 and 15\n) prior to later strike-slip faulting along the FSZ, we interpret that at a certain stage of the magmatic evolution of the Ring of Fire intrusive suite the intrusions coalesced into a tabular-shaped ultramafic\u2013mafic intrusive complex. This complex, stratigraphically underlain by multiple dikes and possibly comprising multiple intrusive cooling units, was dissected and displaced by post-ore deformation (Houl\u00e9 et al. 2019, 2020a). While these insights enhance our understanding of the large-scale processes involved in the formation of the DEI and BTI, they also help us to discern the mode of emplacement for the complex and its chromite mineralized zones.\n\n\n5.4\nOrigins of chromite mineralization\nThe fundamental issue concerning the genesis of chromite mineralization, specifically within the BTI, is how such large quantities of chromite could accumulate (Carson et al., 2015). A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of stratiform chromitite in similar ultramafic\u2013mafic layered complexes (e.g., Bushveld Complex, South Africa; Stillwater Complex, USA). The plethora of ideas can be boiled down to two alternative sets of ideas. In slurry models, chromite has formed in a cotectic assemblage with silicate minerals (most commonly olivine) and was then mechanically sorted to form layers with a range of chromite modes from monomineralic chromitite to chromite-bearing dunite (e.g., Maier et al., 2013; Forien et al., 2015; Mungall et al., 2016; Jenkins and Mungall 2018). In chromite-only models, magma was perturbed into a state in which chromite was the only mineral on the liquidus, leading to an episode of deposition of pure chromitite (Irvine, 1976; Irvine, 1977; Campbell and Murck, 1993; Lipin, 1993; Rollinson, 1997; Latypov et al., 2017, 2018). This issue remains a matter of active research and debate and its resolution is well beyond the scope of the present article; however, the occurrence in the EIC of rocks carrying a complete spectrum of chromite modes (Carson et al., 2015; Laarman, 2014; Azar, 2010), combined with abundant evidence for intermittent and locally bifurcating layering, leads us to favor the former hypothesis as argued in detail by Jenkins and Mungall (2018). It is noteworthy that the volume of missing magma from which the observed mass of chromite must have accumulated is far less in the slurry model than in the chromite-only models (Azar, 2010; Mungall et al., 2016; Jenkins and Mungall, 2018).\nThe original configuration of magma and cumulates within the BTI and DEI ultramafic complex prior to solidification and subsequent tectonic overprint can be considered in terms of two end-member possibilities. They might have formed as a single connected volume characterized by the persistence of a long-lived liquid-dominated magma chamber from which layers of chromite, dunite, and pyroxenite were deposited, or they may have been created as two or more separate intrusions derived from the same mantle source that eventually amalgamated over time through inflation of individual intrusions or through sequential emplacement and complete solidification of multiple injections of magma in the same place as suggested by Houl\u00e9 et al., (2019, 2020a).\nConsidering the first possibility, one would anticipate that chromite mineralization would form as a continuous or semi-continuous layer spanning both the DEI and BTI. When examining the 3D geometry of the chromitite layers (Figs. 13 and 14b) in relation to the reconstruction (Figs. 11 and 15a, b), chromitite horizons of both complexes appear to have very similar orientations, broadly aligned along strike and, with the exception of the Black Label and Blackbird 1 chromitite zones, situated at a similar elevation (RL; Fig. 15b). Relatively sparse drilling between the complexes makes it difficult to determine whether a connection exists based on drill logs and the 3D geometry alone. For instance, drill logs from 9 drillholes that intersect the ultramafic portion of the DEI within about 600\u00a0m northeast of Black Horse reveal the presence of massive to semi-massive chromite layers. Additionally, two drillholes that intersect the narrow ultramafic sequence along the FSZ extension reveal the existence of sheared intermittent chromitite (within 50\u00a0m of the FSZ) to interbedded semi-massive and massive chromite and disseminations in peridotite. While this indicates that chromite mineralization occurs within the narrow ultramafic series between the intrusions, implying that semi-continuous chromitite extends across the DEI (akin to BTI chromitites), it does not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that these mineralized zones are fragments of what was originally a single continuous layer that transgressed both intrusions.\nAlternatively, if we accept that mechanical sorting was a primary mechanism in the formation of chromitite in the BTI and DEI, it can be speculated that the complex was emplaced over time through multiple intrusions of highly contaminated primitive magma. As hot komatiitic magma ascends from the mantle, it is expected that it will assimilate crustal rock and begin to cool, precipitating olivine, chromite and possibly orthopyroxene along the way (Jenkins and Mungall, 2018). This type of low-viscosity magma could have migrated upwards along regional fracture planes until it began to move laterally along the boundary between the granodiorite and overlying mafic dominated volcanic rocks. It is possible that multiple conduits (i.e., Eagle\u2019s Nest, AT-1, AT-5, C-6, and AT-12) delivered small batches of crystal-laden melt from the same magmatic source to separate locations along this horizontal interface. With sustained magma input over time, these injections of magma could have been emplaced above or below pre-existing intrusions or interleaved between them. Ultimately, the accretion of these small sill-like intrusions would have increased the total apparent thickness of the intruded material, producing the thick ultramafic\u2013mafic packages observed in the DEI and BTI, respectively. If the duration between distinct magma pulses was short enough and sufficient latent heat remained, new injections could have stayed hotter for a sufficient amount of time to avoid rapid freezing, thereby facilitating their lateral extension and the eventual amalgamation of the ultramafic\u2013mafic portions of the complex (Magee et al., 2016 and references therein; Houl\u00e9 et al., 2020a). While evidence for the stacking and amalgamation of sill-like intrusions has not been observed in drill core, the auto-intrusive contacts of these intrusions would be hard to recognize due to the absence of observable chilled margins along such hot erosive boundaries (Mungall et al., 2016). Between these two extreme end-member hypotheses lies a range of possible scenarios in which two or more ultramafic intrusions might have grown due to the repeated injection of chromite- and olivine-saturated magma through the same long-lived horizontal conduits, fed by dikes in the footwall.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nOur 3D geological modeling of the main structures and intrusive contacts of the Black Thor and Double Eagle intrusions leads to the following conclusions and implications for mineral exploration:\n\n\u2022\nThe displacement and drag of gabbro and mafic volcanic units along the Frank shear zone imply a late-stage dextral apparent motion with a minimum offset of 1.5\u00a0km. In the Double Eagle intrusion, restoration of this deformation realigns the lobate ultramafic rocks (AT-1, AT-5, and C-6) in the hanging wall of the Frank shear zone with those in the footwall, as well as the contact between the gabbro and metavolcanic units. The 3D reconstruction allows the realignment of the ultramafic\u2013mafic portions of the Double Eagle intrusion with that of the Black Thor intrusion, strongly suggesting that the intrusions were parts of a single composite intrusive complex prior to its dissection by ductile shear zones.\n\n\n\u2022\nEagle\u2019s Nest is interpreted as a weakly deformed, blade-shaped dike with sulfide mineralization concentrated along the basal (north-northwestern) edge. The apparent termination of the conduit at the Frank shear zone suggests that the Eagle\u2019s Nest sulfides may continue at depth, displaced to an undetermined location within the footwall of the Frank shear zone.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe interpreted feeder dikes (Eagle\u2019s Nest, AT-1, AT-5, C-6, and AT-12) exhibit parallel orientations that are likely a result of their emplacement along regional fracture planes. Vertical offsets observed where the walls of the feeder dikes widen into the overlying intrusions, and autobrecciation of the Eagle\u2019s Nest conduit, suggest that these fracture planes may have been acting as extensional faults at the time of magma emplacement.\n\n\n\u2022\nExploration drill holes intersecting chromitite units confirm the 3D modeling of the laterally successive ore zones with similar stratigraphic positioning. This suggests that the chromite mineralization may be laterally continuous, even being present within the narrow ultramafic series between the Black Thor intrusion and Double Eagle intrusion, however, there is insufficient evidence at this stage, to demonstrate that this mineralization formed as a single continuous layer that transgressed both intrusions, due to a lack of exploration drilling.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe generalized 3D geometry of modeled chromitite layers shows their transitions along strike from single thick layers of chromitite to simple bifurcations or intercalated zones of chromite identified as 15%\u201335% Cr2O3 in dunite. These 3D-modelled features suggest that mechanical sorting may have been a critical mechanism responsible for the formation of the thick layers of chromitite within the Black Thor intrusion and possibly the Double Eagle intrusion. This implies that the formation of chromitite within an open system does not necessitate fractional crystallization and gravitational settling in a large, closed magma chamber and can occur within smaller sill-like conduits.\n\n\n\u2022\nBased on the 3D model, it is likely that the Black Thor and Double Eagle intrusions were emplaced through multiple successive intrusions that eventually coalesced to form a single composite intrusive complex (the Esker intrusive complex), prior to being dissected by post-mineralization shear zone deformation.\n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nA range of mineral systems, including giant BIF-derived Fe, Kiruna-type Fe-P, anorthosite-hosted ilmenite, IOCG, intrusion-related Ni-Cu-PGE, carbonatite-related REE-P-Nb-(Cu), and more rarely porphyry Cu-Mo-Au and orogenic gold occur on the margins of long-lived Precambrian cratons (Groves and Santosh, 2021). Among these, orogenic gold deposits are those formed in convergent margins, normally during subduction of oceanic slabs or more rarely collision between continental blocks. They are located in metamorphic domains where gold mineralization is controlled by ductile-brittle shear zones or faults and their conjunction with rheologically and geochemically suitable rock units (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2019a). They have low-salinity H2O-CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4-H2S ore fluids, formation depths ranging from 2 to 20\u00a0km, and mineralization temperatures between 200\u00a0\u00b0C and 650\u00a0\u00b0C with corresponding alteration assemblages varying with depth of deposition (Groves, 1993; Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995). Although there is general agreement on tectonic settings for gold metallogenesis, temporal relations between mineralization and evolution of orogenic belts, styles of structures controlling mineralization, and deposit geology including alteration and ore mineral assemblages (Kerrich et al., 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2005), the source of ore-fluids responsible for orogenic gold mineralization remains controversial (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015 and references therein). Most authors favor a source of auriferous fluids from metamorphic dehydration of the crustal rocks that host or underlie mineralization (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Tomkins and Grundy, 2009; Phillips and Powell, 2010; Tomkins, 2010). Others have proposed deeper sources (Wyman et al., 2016) either from devolatilization of the subduction slab and overlying sediments (Kerrich and Wyman, 1990; Kerrich, 1999; Groves et al., 2020a) or of metasomatized mantle lithosphere (Hronsky et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2020a; Groves et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020c). These different genetic models have subtle but significant impacts in terms of conceptual exploration targeting (Groves et al., 2020a).\nOrogenic gold deposits contribute about 30% of the total gold resources worldwide (Goldfarb et al., 2019). China has become the biggest gold producer since 2005 as exploration activity increased to meet demand (Groves et al., 2020a). In China, the Daduhe orogenic gold belt has a mining history of over 200\u00a0years, but its gold resources are probably underestimated as there are few relevant reports, and most gold deposits have only been exploited to depths of 200\u00a0\u223c\u00a0300\u00a0m. In the giant Jiaodong gold province (Deng et al., 2020b; Fan et al., 2021), a \u223c10,000\u00a0t gold resource is distributed in a total area of \u223c2000\u00a0km2 (Deng and Wang, 2016), whereas the Daduhe gold belt covers over 10,000\u00a0km2 with numerous relatively small but high gold-grade deposits (Fan et al., 2013b; Wang et al., 2020b), confirming its future potential. The Jiaodong and Qinling gold provinces in China have attracted much research work (Mao et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2020a; Deng et al., 2020b; Deng et al., 2020c), whereas the Daduhe gold belt has long been ignored because of its remote and difficult terrains combined with a lack of discovery of large gold deposits, in part due to a poor understanding of the critical controls on gold mineralization.\nPrevious studies in the Daduhe gold belt have mostly involved documentation of the geological characteristics of individual known deposits and research on their ore fluid sources (Chen et al., 1997; Wang, 2000; Li, 2001). However, there is an overall lack of province-scale syntheses (Zhang, 2016), making development of a belt-wide mineral system model difficult. Available geochronology demonstrates that most gold deposits in the belt were formed in the Cenozoic (Yan et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005), both in the Kangding area in the northern segment (Wang et al., 2005) and the Shimian area in the southern segment (Ying and Luo, 2007) with other pre-Cenozoic episodes not clearly identified. Critical structural controls are also unclear at the belt scale. Some studies show that gold ore bodies are confined to NNE-trending faults (Chen et al., 1997; Mao, 2020), although the regional strata and faults have dominantly NW trends and whether these are regional controls is unclear.\nRecent studies demonstrate that craton margins are favorable sites for formation of world-class to supergiant deposits of various types, including IOCG, Fe-V-Ti, Cu-Ni-PGE, some porphyry Cu-Mo-Au, carbonatite-related REE, and orogenic gold deposits (Groves and Santosh, 2021; Chong et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022). The western margin of the Yangtze Craton in China which contains the Daduhe belt is also host to large to giant deposits of these diverse deposit types (Hou et al., 2009; Zhou et al. 2014), but hosts few large orogenic gold deposits relative to other margins of the Yangtze and North China Cratons (Yang et al., 2022). However, the large (>50\u00a0t Au) Danba gold deposit is an exception which increases the total gold resources of the belt to over 300\u00a0t (Table S1; Fan et al., 2013b) and is significant in terms of generation of genetic models of relevance to regional exploration (Zhao et al., 2019, 2021; Wang et al., 2022). In this study, the temporal and spatial distribution of gold deposits in the Daduhe gold belt is reviewed to establish genetic relations within the components of the Daduhe orogenic gold system and between it and the diverse range of other deposit types on the western margin of the Yangtze craton, leading to improved conceptual exploration targeting.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe Daduhe gold belt is in the western Sichuan Province, on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton (Fig. 1\na). The northern segment of the belt constitutes a part of the Songpan-Ganzi fold belt, whereas the southern segment is confined by the Panxi (Panzhihua-Xichang) rift zone (Fig. 1b). The western margin of the Yangtze Craton witnessed Neoproterozoic oceanic subduction (Zhou et al., 2002; Zhao and Zhou, 2008), eruption of the Emeishan large igneous province (Xu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2009), intraplate orogeny after closure of the Paleo-Tethy Ocean (Deng et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2020), and uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau caused by India-Asia collision (Hou et al., 2006; Deng and Wang, 2016). Diverse world-class to supergiant deposits are distributed on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton, including Proterozoic IOCG, Mesozoic Fe-Ti-V and Cu-Ni-PGE, and Cenozoic porphyry Cu-Mo-Au, carbonatite-related REE and more rarely orogenic gold deposits (Fig. 1b; Munteanu et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014).\n\n2.1\nLithosphere-scale faults and regional domes\nIn the northern segment of the Daduhe gold belt, the Xianshuihe strike-slip fault is the dominant lithosphere-scale fault (Figs. 1b and 2; Zhang, 2013). The Xianshuihe Fault was initiated before \u223c170\u00a0Ma, as constrained by U-Pb dating of zircon in a syn-kinematic granite intrusion (Li et al., 2015). Although the Xianshuihe strike-slip fault is sinistral at present (Chevalier et al., 2018), structural analysis and creep-deformation measurements have demonstrated that the fault previously was dextral (Peng et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017). In the southern segment of the belt, Jinpingshan, Anninghe, and Xiaojiang are major lithosphere-scale faults (Figs. 1b and 2). The Xianshuihe Fault merges into the Anninghe Fault in the Shimian area, indicating that the two faults have a deep connection (Zhang, 2013).\nThe western margin of the Yangtze Craton is characterized by a >1000\u00a0km Mesozoic domal belt along the Longmenshan-Jinpingshan thrust system (Fig. 1b; Zhou et al., 2008; Billerot et al., 2017). From north to south, large-scale domes include Danba in the Danba area, Dashuigou in the Shimian area, and Jianglang in the Mianning area (Figs. 1b and 2). The dome and decollement structures are illustrated by exposures of Neoproterozoic basement as metamorphic core complexes (Roger et al., 2004). Uranium-Pb dating of metamorphic outer zones of magmatic zircon grains in basement granite and Ar-Ar dating of amphibole in schist, together constrain formation of the metamorphic core complexes to 180\u00a0\u223c\u00a0160\u00a0Ma (Zhou et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2008). The domal belt was further uplifted in the Cenozoic in response to collisional orogeny on the Tibetan Plateau (Hou et al., 2006). Numerous gold deposits are distributed in the cores and along the margins of the domes (Fig. 2\n).\n\n\n2.2\nLithostratigraphy and metamorphism\nAlong the domal belt of the western Yangtze Craton, the exposed Proterozoic basement (Figs. 2\u20134\n\n) comprises mainly metamorphosed Panxi-Hannan arc assemblages which were formed during subduction of an ocean slab in the Neoproterozoic (Zhou et al., 2002; Zhao and Zhou, 2008), with minor Proterozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (Xu et al., 1996; Roger et al., 2010). The basement rocks are mainly granitic gneiss, gneissic granites, and migmatites with minor schists, amphibolite, and granulite (Xu et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 2008). Gneiss in the basement records granulite-facies peak metamorphism at ca. 800\u00a0Ma with temperatures of \u223c710\u00a0\u00b0C and subsequent amphibolite-facies retrograde metamorphism (Wang et al., 2020a).\nThe basement is unconformably overlain by Paleozoic strata including Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, and Permian marble, quartzite, schist, and gneiss (Figs. 2\u20134), which themselves are unconformably overlain by Triassic flysch, composed of sandstones, carbonates, and turbidities (Roger et al., 2010). Based on Thermocalc modeling (Weller et al., 2013) and other thermobarometers and monazite U-Pb geochronology on metapelite and amphibolite, amphibolite-facies metamorphism peaked during 197\u00a0\u223c\u00a0180\u00a0Ma in the Danba dome area (4.8\u20136.3\u00a0kbar, 640\u2013680\u00a0\u00b0C; Billerot et al., 2017). The estimated peak-metamorphic conditions around the Danba gold deposit, recorded by sillimanite-grade metapelite, are 640\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C and 4.8\u00a0kbar at 193.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0Ma (Huang et al., 2003a; Huang et al., 2003b).\n\n\n2.3\nMafic-ultramafic and granite intrusions\nMafic-ultramafic rocks are widely distributed on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton and especially in the gold districts (Figs. 4\u00a0and\u00a05\nc; Supplementary data Table S1). Basic dyke swarms on the craton margin were mostly emplaced in the Neoproterozoic (Lin et al., 2007). Dolerite intrusions in the belt have peak emplacement ages of \u223c750\u00a0Ma, \u223c430\u00a0Ma, and \u223c220\u00a0Ma (Liu, 2016). Mafic rocks related to the Emeishan large igneous province have restricted ages of \u223c260\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2009). Cenozoic mafic rocks in the belt are poorly dated. Lamprophyres are exposed in many gold districts such as that of the Zhangjiapingzi gold deposit in the southern segment of the belt (Table S1).\nIntermediate-acid intrusions are widespread in the Triassic sequences around the regional domes, normally over 10\u00a0km distal to gold deposits (Fig. 3). The Late Triassic to Early Jurassic granites can be subdivided into two age groups (Roger et al., 2004). The first group comprises late-orogenic, ca. 230\u2013200\u00a0Ma granites that have I-type and\/or adakitic characteristics (Zhang et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2007; Yuan et al. 2010). The second group is represented by late- to post-orogenic, A-and S-type granites containing mafic enclaves dated at ca. 210\u2013180\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al. 2007; Sigoyer et al. 2014; Jolivet et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017), consistent with intensive mantle-crust interaction and lithospheric extension during this period (Li et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n3\nContinuum of orogenic gold deposits\nThis study investigates a continuum (Groves, 1993) of thirty-three gold deposits of the Daduhe orogenic gold belt, including three hypozonal, twenty-six mesozonal and four epizonal members (Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995). They comprise both quartz vein and disseminated gold ores which are hosted in both the basement and unconformably overlying strata (Zhang, 2016). The three subtypes of deposits all have relatively high gold grades ranging from \u223c5 to \u223c10\u00a0g\/t Au (Table S1).\n\n3.1\nHypozonal gold deposits\nThe hypozonal deposits (Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995) are defined as having amphibolite-facies host rocks, high-T alteration minerals such as biotite and amphibole (Fig. 6\na) with only minor carbonate alteration, and homogenization temperatures up to \u223c400\u00a0\u00b0C for H2O-CO2-CH4-NaCl fluid inclusions with low salinity of \u223c3\u201310\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. (Zhao et al., 2019; Table S1). The representatives include the large Danba gold deposit around the Danba dome, the small Taogou deposit on the edge of the basement, both located in the northern segment of the belt (Fig. 3), and the medium-sized Dashuigou deposit around the Dashuigou dome in the Shimian area (Luo and Cao, 1996), located in the southern segment of the belt (Fig. 4). The hypozonal deposits have quartz-vein-dominated mineralization, ore assemblages dominated by pyrrhotite and widespread Bi-Te minerals (Fig. 6b), and native gold containing Te and Bi inclusions (Table S1).\n\n\n3.2\nMesozonal gold deposits\nThe mesozonal deposits (Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995) have greenschist-facies host rocks, moderate-T alteration minerals dominated by sericite with common carbonation (Fig. 6c), and homogenization temperatures at \u223c300\u00a0\u00b0C for H2O-CO2-NaCl fluid inclusions with low salinity of \u223c1\u201315\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. (Hou et al., 2012; Table S1). Mesozonal deposits are dominant in the Daduhe gold belt with representative deposits including Yanzigou, Huangjinping, Sandiao, and Heijintaizi in the Danba-Kangding area of the northern segment (Fig. 3), and Jintaizi, Jinjitai, and Xuejiaya in the Shimian-Manning area of the southern segment of the belt (Fig. 4). Most mesozonal deposits are small and hosted by both basement and Paleozoic and Triassic cover rocks (Zhang, 2016; Table S1). They have both quartz-vein and disseminated ores and ore minerals dominated by pyrite (Fig. 6d) with minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena, and local Bi-Te minerals in some deposits where Te and Bi are also contained within native gold (Table S1).\n\n\n3.3\nEpizonal gold deposits\nThe epizonal deposits (Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995) are those with sub-greenschist-facies metamorphic host rocks, low-T carbonate alteration dominated by ankerite (Fig. 6e), and homogenization temperatures at \u223c200\u00a0\u00b0C for H2O-CO2-NaCl fluid inclusions (Zhou et al., 2015; Table S1). Most epizonal deposits are small and hosted mainly in the Triassic low-grade metamorphic strata (Zhang et al., 2013). Representative deposits such as Zhangjiapingzi and Caizidi are mostly in the Shimian-Manning area of the southern segment (Fig. 4). Their mineralization is characterized by disseminated ores with ore assemblages dominated by pyrite and widespread tetrahedrite (Fig. 6e, f; Wang and Zhang, 1999) which are commonly oxidized at the surface to limonite and covellite, respectively (Luo and Tan, 2013). The native gold contains negligible Te and Bi (Table S1).\n\n\n\n4\nTemporal evolution of gold metallogeny\n\n4.1\nMultistage mineralization\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that gold mineralization in the Daduhe belt evolved in the Cenozoic (Yan et al. 2002; Wang et al., 2005; Ying and Luo, 2007). However, recent geochronology has shown that there were at least two episodes of gold mineralization in the belt (Fig. 7\n).\n\nClosure of the Paleo-Tethy Ocean and related gold mineralization. Molybdenite Re-Os dating provides an Early Jurassic age of 185.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4\u00a0Ma for the deposition of the hypozonal Danba gold deposit in the northern segment of the belt (Fig. 3). The dated molybdenite contains native gold inclusions (Zhao et al., 2019), indicating a reliable and robust age for deposition from the auriferous fluid (Stein et al., 2001). This age is slightly younger, but within error of, the age of regional peak metamorphism at 193.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0Ma (Huang et al., 2003a; Huang et al., 2003b) and consistent with the age of doming at 180\u00a0\u223c\u00a0160\u00a0Ma in the region. These ages indicate that the Danba gold deposit was formed during intraplate orogeny after closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean in the late Triassic (Deng et al., 2014; Fig. 7).\n\nCollisional orogeny in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and related gold mineralization. Most mesozonal and epizonal gold deposits in both the northern and southern segments of the Daduhe belt were formed in the Cenozoic with two peaks at \u223c60\u00a0Ma and \u223c25-20\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7). The former is constrained by the Yanzigou deposit with an age of 55.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0Ma produced from sericite Ar-Ar dating (Wang QF, unpublished data) and the Ruoji deposit with an age of \u223c59\u00a0Ma produced from quartz Ar-Ar dating (Wang et al., 2005), both in the northern segment of the belt (Fig. 3). Although most ages of the \u223c25-20\u00a0Ma episode are derived using quartz Ar-Ar and sericite K-Ar methods which are relatively unreliable, several gold-related sericite Ar-Ar ages in the Dashuigou gold district of the southern segment confirm the \u223c25-20\u00a0Ma episode of gold mineralization in the belt (Ying and Luo, 2007; Fig. 4; Table S1). The two age peaks are consistent with those for the gold deposits formed in compressional and extensional systems, respectively, in the inner zone of the Tibetan Plateau (Wang et al., 2020b; Yang et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.2\nRegional ore-controlling structures\nThe occurrence of orogenic gold deposits in the Daduhe belt is confined to the vicinity of lithosphere-scale faults. In the northern segment, the gold deposits are controlled by secondary faults related to the NNW-trending Xianshuihe Fault (Fig. 1b). They are commonly located at the intersections between local broadly NW- and NE-trending faults (Fig. 3). In the southern segment, the gold deposits are confined between the N-S-trending Anninghe Fault and the NNE-trending Jinpingshan Thrusts (Fig. 1b). At an ore district scale, they are controlled by NE-trending thrusts and N-S trending faults constrained between two regional NW-trending shear zones (Fig. 4).\nThe hypozonal gold deposits including Danba, Taogou, and Dashuigou are restricted to the domal areas (Figs. 3 and 4) with the large Danba gold deposit located on the western edge of the regional Danba dome (Fig. 3). Its host rocks are Devonian amphibolite-facies metamorphic cover sequences which form a west-dipping monocline (Zhao et al., 2019). The medium-sized Dashuigou deposit is on the northern edge of the regional Dashuigou dome (Fig. 4), whereas the small Taogou deposit is located at the northern edge of the extensive Proterozoic basement (Fig. 3).\nThe mesozonal and epizonal gold deposits are controlled by internal shear zones in the migmatite basement and transition zones between the basement and cover sequences (Figs. 3 and 4), with an intimate spatial relationship to uplifted Proterozoic basement related to decollements (Roger et al., 2004).\n\n\n4.3\nDeposit ore-controlling structures\nThe association of NW-and NE-trending structures at the deposit scale is similar to that on the regional scale in the Daduhe gold belt (Figs. 3\u20135; Haddad-Martim et al., 2018). For most gold deposits, the ore bodies are not hosted by the pervasive NW-trending compressional faults, but by secondary NNE-trending extensional faults or fractures (Fig. 5). Data from eight 1\/200,000 regional geological maps show that, adjacent to the gold deposits, the strike of sequences proximal to the gold deposits change from a near N-S to NNE (20\u00b0) orientation (Fig. 8\na), although the regional strike of both stratigraphy and structure is normally NW (Fig. 8b). This implies that the regional stress field imposed dextral movement on the major NW-trending faults during the main gold mineralization episodes (Fig. 5; Peng et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017), although the current movement on the Xianshuihe strike-slip fault is sinistral (Chevalier et al., 2018). Argon-Ar dating of mica in mylonite combined with structural analysis indicates that there was dextral shearing at \u223c198\u2013158\u00a0Ma in the region (Lin et al., 2009). The far-field stress that imposed dextral movement on the NW-trending shear zones could have generated NNE-trending secondary extensional faults or fractures (Fig. 5; Masurel et al., 2017). Further, this fault system once formed in the Early Jurassic could be re-activated in the Cenozoic providing pathways for auriferous fluids during each gold mineralization episode (Groves et al., 2018), with fluids focused into dilation zones within the second-order NNE-trending extensional faults and fractures (Fig. 5; Mao, 2020). In the Daduhe gold belt, gold mineralization is best developed in parts of shear zones that are significantly misoriented from the regional trend (Figs. 3\u20135 and 8), as in the eastern Yilgarn of Western Australia (Weinberg et al., 2004; Groves et al., 2018).\nThe Daduhe gold ore bodies are mainly sited near lithologic interfaces (Fig. 5) that can provide rheological contrasts and induce selective fracturing and fluid-rock interaction during seismic-induced hydrofracturing (Sibson et al., 1988; Cox, 2016; Groves et al., 2018). For example, the Danba ore bodies are hosted in a major ductile-brittle shear zone between competent quartzite and relatively less competent biotite schists (Fig. 5a; Zhao et al., 2019). Gold mineralization in the Caizidi deposit is confined to fault zones between Neoproterozoic and Silurian strata (Fig. 5c; Yang, 2000) and most ore bodies in the Dashuigou gold deposit are distributed along contacts between amphibole-schist and marble (Fig. 5e; Luo and Cao, 1996). The ore fluids tend to precipitate pyrite- or pyrrhotite-bearing gold ores in mafic metasedimentary rocks (Fig. 5a, b, d, e), probably because Au-HS complexes in the ore fluids react with their higher Fe contents to co-precipitate gold and Fe-sulfides (Elmer et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n5\nGenetic model for orogenic gold deposits\n\n5.1\nContinuum of gold mineralization\nIn the Daduhe gold belt, the crustal metamorphic model which proposes that orogenic gold deposits can only form under mesothermal conditions above the transition zone between amphibolite- and greenschist-facies metamorphic domains (Phillips and Powell, 2010; Tomkins and Grundy, 2009; Tomkins, 2010), appears to be invalid. Evidence against this model includes: 1) the Early Jurassic hypozonal Danba gold deposit hosted by amphibolite-facies wall rocks was formed slightly post regional peak metamorphism, implying that the ore fluid was derived from below the amphibolite-facies domain (Zhao et al., 2019); and 2) most of the Cenozoic gold deposits are hosted by the Proterozoic basement which experienced granulite- and migmatite-facies metamorphism in the Neoproterozoic and Mesozoic respectively (Billerot et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020a). This means that the basement would already have lost most of its water, sulfur, and volatiles (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014), and could not provide large volumes of fluid for Mesozoic to Cenozoic gold mineralization (Wang et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2020b).\nThe hypozonal, mesozonal, and epizonal gold deposits in the Daduhe belt constitute a crustal continuum model as defined by Groves (1993) (Fig. 9\n). They form at depths of arguably\u00a0>\u00a015\u00a0km to\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0km and have host lithological units varying from Neoproterozoic basement migmatites, Paleozoic amphibolite- and greenschist-facies metasedimentary rocks, Triassic sub-greenschist-facies turbidites, to granite intrusions (Table S1). This is consistent with the view that upper crustal successions cannot be the fluid and metal source for orogenic gold systems, implicating sub-crustal source regions (Wyman et al., 2016). For the Daduhe gold deposits, the similarities in ore elements of Au-Ag-(Te-Bi) and fluid inclusion components and salinities (Table S1) for both the Early Jurassic and Cenozoic gold deposits implicate a common fluid source below the basement.\n\n\n5.2\nMetasomatized mantle lithosphere fluid source\nDespite the diversity of host lithological units, the three sub-types of gold deposits in the Daduhe gold belt have similar sulfur isotope values of \u223c0\u201310\u2030 (Fig. 10\n). Although many factors, such as phase separation caused by pressure fluctuation and\/or fluid-rock reactions, would affect sulfur isotope ratios in the ore fluid (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015), the ore fluids depositing the Daduhe gold deposits were mainly reduced, as the ore assemblage is dominated by pyrrhotite and pyrite, without magnetite, hematite, or sulfate minerals (Table S1). Under such ore-fluid redox conditions, \u03b434Ssulfide is a good approximation of the \u03b434Sfluid state (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979). The sulfur isotope values of ore pyrrhotite and pyrite (\u223c0\u201310\u2030), although not diagnostic, are consistent with those of sulfides from metasomatized mantle lithosphere (Wang et al., 2020c). Although enriched mantle lithosphere could have \u03b434S of \u22122.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u2030 (Li et al., 2020), mantle lithosphere metasomatized and fertilized by a subducted oceanic slab would have increased \u03b434S and \u03b418O values (Lee et al., 2018; Hutchison et al., 2021). The \u03b418Ofluid of 5.5\u00a0\u223c\u00a011\u2030 for the Daduhe gold deposits is also consistent with, although not diagnostic of, a metasomatized mantle lithosphere source (Fig. 11\n; Straaten et al., 2012; Banerjee et al., 2018).\nThe Huangjinping, Baijintaizi, and Heijintaizi gold deposits in the Kangding area of the north segment of the belt (Fig. 3), have 3He\/4He of 0.16\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.86 Ra and 40Ar\/36Ar of 298\u00a0\u223c\u00a03290 produced from noble gas analyses of fluid inclusions in the ore pyrite (Li et al., 2007). In conjunction, the noble gas and other stable isotope data indicate that the ore-forming fluids contain significant mantle components (Li et al., 2007). Similarly, stepwise heating of olivine and clinopyroxene grains separated from gabbro and olivine-gabbro samples collected from the Panzhihua ultramafic intrusions produced 3He\/4He of 0.08\u20134.34 Ra (mean 0.78 Ra) and variable 40Ar\/36Ar signatures which are interpreted to represent the noble gas characteristics of the metasomatized mantle lithosphere on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton (Hou et al., 2011). Thus, S-O-He-Ar isotopic analyses in combination are consistent with a model in which the gold deposits in the Daduhe belt had ore fluids derived from a common metasomatized mantle lithosphere source previously fertilized by hydrous fluids, sulfur, and metals.\n\n\n5.3\nEnriched mantle source on craton margins\nThe transition zones in lithosphere thickness on craton margins with a complex evolutionary history are proposed to control the formation of giant metallogenic belts comprising a diverse range of deposit types including orogenic gold deposits (Bierlein et al., 2006; Lawley et al., 2014; Groves and Santosh, 2021). Giant mineralization systems on craton margins not only require lithosphere-scale faults to transport ore-forming fluids or melts, but also require deep source regions with metal and volatile enrichment to produce fertile magmas (Begg et al., 2010). Mantle xenoliths transported to the surface by kimberlites or basic-ultrabasic magmas demonstrate that metasomatized mantle lithosphere is rich in H2O, CO2, and other volatiles (O'Reilly and Griffin, 2013). This metasomatism could be caused by low-degree partial melts derived from mantle plumes or rift activities involving asthenosphere upwelling, but mainly resulted from oceanic subduction on plate margins (Hughes et al., 2015). Dehydration, decarbonation, and desulfidation of the subducted oceanic crust and overlying sediments provide the volatiles and metals to metasomatize and fertilize mantle lithosphere (Groves and Santosh, 2021).\nMany petrological and mineralogical studies have shown that an enriched mantle lithosphere that formed by subduction-related metasomatism exists on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton (Zhao and Zhou, 2008; Zhang et al., 2016). Derivation of the Panxi-hannan ultrabasic magmatism from a Neoproterozoic mantle plume or subduction of paleo-oceans remains controversial (Zhou et al., 2002; Zou et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2021). However, proponents of both views agree on the existence of a 1.0\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.8\u00a0Ga subduction event on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton (Roger et al., 2010). Since there was no post-Neoproterozoic subduction in the region, the enriched mantle lithosphere could only be formed during or before the Neoproterozoic (Zhang et al., 2016). The He-Ar isotopic studies of Hou et al. (2011) indicate that this enriched mantle lithosphere in the western Yangtze Craton was formed by metasomatism of altered oceanic crust.\nIOCG deposits in the Panxi area have ores enriched in Fe, Cu, Au, REE, Mo, Co, and Ag (Zhou et al. 2014; Zhao et al., 2017). In addition, the Proterozoic IOCG deposits including the large Lala deposit have \u03b434Ssulfide of 2\u00a0\u223c\u00a06\u2030 (Zhao and Zhou, 2011) and \u03b418Ofluid of 7.2\u00a0\u223c\u00a011.7\u2030 (Chen and Zhou, 2012; Zhao et al., 2017). The\u00a0\u223c\u00a0260\u00a0Ma Cu-Ni-PGE deposits, including the large Yangliuping deposit, which are interpreted to be products of a mantle plume interacting with Neoproterozoic metasomatized mantle lithosphere (Hou et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011), have \u03b434S of sulfides at 0\u00a0\u223c\u00a08\u2030 (Wang et al., 2018). The Cenozoic porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposits including the large Beiya deposit have \u03b434Ssulfide of \u22122.4\u00a0\u223c\u00a04.5\u2030 (Lu et al., 2014). Importantly, the \u223c27\u201325\u00a0Ma carbonatite-related REE deposits including the large Dalucao deposit have \u03b418Ofluid of 6.4\u00a0\u223c\u00a010.5\u2030 (Hou et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2015). Overall, these types of deposits, although formed under different geodynamic regimes in the western Yangtze Craton, have \u03b434S and \u03b418Ofluid values that overlap those of the Daduhe orogenic gold deposits (Figs. 10 and 11). As discussed above, the low He-Ar isotope characteristics of the Panzhihua Fe-V-Ti deposits are similar to those of the Daduhe orogenic gold deposits (Li et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2011). Overall, these highly diverse types of mineral systems have common ore elements (Au, Cu, REE, etc.) and S-O-He-Ar characteristics, indicating the potential for a common ore fluid and\/or metal source derived from fertilized mantle lithosphere with ore components introduced during Neoproterozoic subduction-related metasomatism (Hou et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2020c).\n\n\n5.4\nMultistage mineralization on craton margins\nAs discussed above, the diverse range of ore deposit types, including orogenic gold deposits, in the western Yangtze Craton were most likely formed by multi-stage reactivation of enriched mantle lithosphere (Fig. 12\n; Deng and Wang, 2016). The post-orogenic stage after supercontinent amalgamation is the major metallogenic period for magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal mineral systems on craton margins (Deng et al., 2014; Groves and Santosh, 2021). In the western margin of the Yangtze Craton, Proterozoic magmatic-hydrothermal IOCG and magmatic Fe-Ti-V (Zhuqing: Fan et al., 2013a) and Cu-Ni-PGE (Lengshuiqing: Zhu et al., 2007) deposits were all formed during the breakup stage after assembly of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents (Fig. 12; Pirajno and Santosh, 2015; Zhu et al., 2018). Phanerozoic magmatic Fe-Ti-V, Cu-Ni-PGE, magmatic-hydrothermal porphyry Cu-Mo-Au and carbonatite-related REE deposits were all formed in the breakup stage after amalgamation of the Gondwana-Pangea supercontinent (Fig. 12; Hou et al., 2009; Pirajno and Santosh, 2015). The hydrothermal orogenic gold deposits formed in late Mesozoic to Cenozoic convergent margins that involved initial subduction and subsequent continent collision (Hou et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2020b), but from possibly a similar source to that of the earlier magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal deposits and the broadly coincident porphyry Cu-Mo-Au and carbonatite-related REE deposits on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton (Fig. 12).\nFormation of the hydrous metal-enriched mantle lithosphere source during Proterozoic was a critical first step in the genesis of the Daduhe orogenic gold deposits in the western Yangtze Craton (Fig. 13\na). The ascent of the Emeishan plume occurred at ca. 260\u00a0Ma, prior to the development of 230\u2013200\u00a0Ma adakitic and I type granites and the 210\u2013180\u00a0Ma A and S type granites that precede or overlap the earlier gold event (Zhao et al., 2019). This raises the question of why the plume did not promote gold mineralization or rework the lithosphere source region to mobilize and destroy the gold reservoir. The reason may have been that the Proterozoic subduction event left a \u201changing slab\u201d beneath the western Yangzte that largely protected the lithosphere while allowing for the local ascent of plume-derived magmas (Zou et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2021). Eventual collapse of the plume likely led to complete loss of the old slab, which by then had been modified by the plume. Slab loss drove the sequence of events that started with the production of adakites followed by those processes that are more typically associated with orogenic gold in \u201cnormal\u201d settings (Tassara et al., 2017).\nSubsequently, the gold mineralization involved at least two mantle-crust interaction events. First, during the Early Jurassic transition stage from transpression to extension after closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, as indicated by the occurrence of adakitic rocks and A-type granites, the thickened lithosphere was delaminated due to gravity instability which resulted in asthenosphere upwelling (Zhang et al., 2007; Sigoyer et al., 2014). This is interpreted to have heated and reactivated the Neoproterozoic enriched mantle lithosphere to release auriferous H2O-CO2-CH4 fluids which migrated upward along the lithosphere-scale Xianshuihe Fault and deposited at the margin of the Danba dome, forming the large hypozonal Danba gold deposit (Fig. 13b; Zhao et al., 2019). Later, during the collision of India with Asia involving lateral crustal thickening and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (Hou et al., 2006), the Cenozoic orogenic gold deposits in the Daduhe belt are interpreted to have formed via similar processes to those resulting in the Early Jurassic orogenic gold mineralization (Fig. 13c). The ore-forming fluids for orogenic gold deposits could have utilized the same or similar lithosphere-scale fault channels as those used by basic-ultrabasic, alkaline, and\/or carbonatite magma derived from enriched mantle lithosphere of the western Yangtze Craton (Hou et al., 2021). This encompassing genetic model can also explain the intimate spatial association between the orogenic gold deposits and enriched mantle-derived rocks such as dolerite and lamprophyre (Guo et al., 2005; Gan and Huang, 2017) in the Daduhe belt (Figs. 4,\u00a05c, and 13; Table S1).\n\n\n\n6\nExploration potential of the Daduhe belt\nThe strong evidence for a widespread hydrous metal-enriched metasomatized mantle lithosphere source below the western margin of the Yangtze Craton suggests that orogenic gold resources have the potential to grow despite the rarity of large deposits (Wang et al. 2019a; Wang et al., 2020b), particularly since enriched mantle lithosphere re-fertilized by slab-related fluids has been proposed as a key requisite in the formation of large auriferous provinces in the overlying crust (Bierlein et al., 2006; Tassara et al., 2017). The discovery of the large hypozonal Danba gold deposit has provided strong encouragement for future exploration in the belt (Fan et al., 2013b). Although orogenic gold deposits may have been removed in the Panxi rift area due to substantial crustal uplift that has exposed Paleo to Mesoproterozoic strata (Fig. 2b), there is still potential for other hypozonal gold deposits in the area.\nThe discovery of Early Jurassic gold mineralization which was formed during intraplate orogeny and controlled by domal structures, as represented by the large Danba hypozonal gold deposit on the western margin of the Danba dome (Figs. 2a and 3), suggests that dome edges are favorable sites for mineralization in rapidly-uplifting high-angle brittle-ductile shear zones (Vollgger et al., 2015). Other orogenic gold belts that are distributed along extensive domal belts include the Massif Central, France (Bouchot et al., 2005), the Paleozoic Meguma formations in Nova Scotia, Canada (Kontak et al., 1990), and the Himalayan gold belt in the inner zone of the Tibetan Plateau (Wang et al., 2020b). The uplift and erosion rates in the northern part of the Danba dome are relatively high (Chen and Lai, 2005), implying potential for hypozonal gold deposits on the northern margin, and for mesozonal and epizonal gold deposits on the southern margin of the Danba dome (Fig. 3).\nCenozoic gold mineralization in the belt was formed during collisional orogeny and confined by shear zones in and around the migmatite basement. Although such Cenozoic largely mesozonal gold mineralization is widespread (Figs. 3 and 4), exploration has only proceeded to 200\u00a0\u223c\u00a0300\u00a0m below surface for these apparently small deposits. The crustal continuum model for orogenic gold deposits (Fig. 9) indicates that gold deposits can form over a wide range of metamorphic grade and extend to considerable depths (Fig. 9). Thus, there is potential for deep roots to extend below known mesozonal deposits and particularly the less common epizonal deposits.\nMost orogenic gold ore bodies in both the Early Jurassic and Cenozoic gold deposits in the belt are contained in reactivated faults or shear zones dominated by dextral movement vectors during the gold mineralization periods with current similar strikes of 0\u00a0\u223c\u00a020\u00b0 (Figs. 2 and 8; Table S1). In contrast to the NW-trending compressional faults which have discontinuous and relatively weak mineralization (Chen et al., 1997), the NNE-trending ore-controlling faults or fractures commonly host thicker mineralized zones with higher gold grades (Fig. 5; Table S1). Thus, NEE-trending cross structures are key exploration targets, particularly between pairs of regional NW strike-slip faults where opposite motion on the northeastern and southwestern surfaces of the fault pair (Figs. 4 and 5) may induce torsional stresses that further dilate the NNE-trending extensional faults (Groves et al., 2018).\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe distribution of widespread Daduhe orogenic gold deposits on the western margin of the Yangtze craton is confined by lithosphere-scale faults such as the Xianshuihe strike-slip fault in the northern segment and the Anninghe and Xiaojiang faults in the southern segment. The Early Jurassic gold mineralization is controlled by domal structures in high-grade metamorphic domains whereas Cenozoic orogenic gold mineralization is sited in shear zones in and around migmatite basement domains. Most gold deposits and component ore bodies occur in NNE-trending second-order extensional faults or fractures that lie distal to, or at the intersections with, the regional first-order NW-trending compressional faults. NNE-trending structures that lie between pairs of the regional NW-trending shear zones are particularly favorable mineralization sites.\nThe hypozonal, mesozonal and epizonal orogenic gold deposits constitute a crustal continuum in the Daduhe belt. Both the Early Jurassic and Cenozoic gold mineralization episodes occurred under post-regional peak metamorphic conditions. Their overlapping \u03b434S of 0\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u2030 and \u03b418Ofluid of 6\u00a0\u223c\u00a011\u2030 combined with low He-Ar isotope values, although equivocal, are entirely consistent with a model in which auriferous, hydrous, and metal-rich ore fluids responsible for deposition of the orogenic gold deposits were derived from mantle lithosphere that was metasomatized and fertilized by devolatilization of a Neoproterozoic subduction slab and overlying sediments. The strong spatial relationships to lamprophyre intrusions, also considered to represent low-degree partial melts of metasomatized mantle lithosphere, support this model.\nThere is evidence from a variety of sources for the existence of metasomatized and fertilized mantle lithosphere below the western margin of the Yangtze Craton from at least the Neoproterozoic. Reactivation of this hydrous metal-enriched mantle lithosphere source at different times, particularly times of post-orogenic activity after supercontinent assembly, formed a diverse range of mineral systems including magmatic-hydrothermal IOCG and porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposits, magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE and Fe-V-Ti deposits, and carbonatite REE deposits on the western margin of the Yangtze Craton. There is spatial overlap with the Early Jurassic to Cenozoic hydrothermal orogenic gold deposits that formed in post-breakup convergent margin settings. These spatial overlaps of such diverse mineral systems in the Daduhe belt provide further evidence of the importance of craton margins as selective tectonic sites for mineral deposits globally. Common deep metasomatized mantle lithosphere sources and lithosphere-scale faults for transport of magmas or ore fluids appear to be pre-requisites for the development of world-class to giant mineral systems in such geodynamic settings.\n\n","26":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nOrogenic gold deposits are the principal sources of gold and are characterized by high grades and large tonnages (Weatherley and Henley, 2013). They occur not only in coeval compressional to transpressional environments but also in strike-slip extensional settings (Chen and Fu, 1992; Groves et al., 1998, 2003; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Chen, 2006, 2013; Blenkinsop et al., 2020). These deposits genetically accepted as being associated with structural deformation, which improves fluid migration and focuses fluid flow on places favourable for gold deposition (Groves et al., 2018). Hence, in the study of orogenic gold deposits, understanding the spatial and temporal association between Au mineralization and the structural evolution history of an orogeny is important for discovering potentially economic orebodies in identified orogenic deposits or for finding deposits in Au prospects.\nThe Beishan orogenic belt, NW China, has experienced multistage accretionary and collisional events and now hosts numerous mineral systems (e.g., Au, Cu, Fe, W, Pb, and Zn) (Fig. 1\n) (Tian et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2017). More than 20 gold deposits that are controlled by large ductile shear zones have been discovered in Beishan, such as the Qingbaishan, Daqingshan, Jinwozi, and Xiaoxigong gold deposits (BGMRXUAR, 1993; Chen et al., 1999, 2020; Zheng et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021). Previous studies have demonstrated that some gold mineralization occurred in the Permian\u2013Triassic periods in the Beishan orogen and is genetically associated with regional coeval dextral strike-slip shearing (Chen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). However, pre-Permian gold mineralization and its temporal relationship with tectonic evolution remain poorly understood.\nLocated in the northern part of the Beishan orogen, the Qingbaishan deposit was discovered in 2018 and is hosted by the Sanjiashan shear zone. At present, the characteristics of ore-forming fluids, timing of mineralization and nature of the ore-controlling structure are unclear, which further hinders Au exploration and prospects in Beishan. In this paper, we report the results obtained from studies on the ore-controlling structure, C-H-O isotopes, and muscovite Ar-Ar geochronology of the Qingbaishan deposit and clarify the nature of the ore-fluid system and timing of gold mineralization in this deposit. We also attempt to constrain the genetic type of the deposit and discuss the correlation between structure and gold mineralization.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Beishan orogen is bounded by the Tianshan orogen to the west and the Dunhuang-Alashan block to the south (Fig. 1). Beishan has undergone multiple accretionary and collisional tectonic movements from the Cambrian to Permian and formed abundant Paleozoic arcs, ophiolitic m\u00e9langes and accretionary complexes (Fig. 1) (Zuo et al., 1990; Xiao et al., 2010). In general, the Beishan orogen incorporates three tectonic units, namely, southern, middle and northern Beishan, with the Niujuanzi-Yueyashan and Xiaohuangshan ophiolitic belts defining the boundaries (Zuo et al., 1990; Wang et al., 2018). Multiple intrusive events are recognized in the Beishan orogen from the Cambrian to Permian, with the majority of magmatism occurring in the Paleozoic era (Xiao et al., 2010; Song et al., 2013).\nThe Qingbaishan mineralized concentration area is located in the northern part of the Beishan orogen (Fig. 1). In recent years, some ore deposits, including the Qingbaishan Pb-Zn deposit, the Qingbaishan Au deposit, and the Juyuan W deposit, have been discovered (Fig. 2\n) (Xia and Chen, 2017; Zheng et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020), indicating that this area has great mineralization conditions and a good potential for mineral prospecting.\nThe main lithostratigraphic units in the Qingbaishan area are the lower-middle Proterozoic crystalline basement, the Cambrian and Ordovician marine strata, the Permian strata, and the Miocene Kuche Formation (Zheng et al., 2019). The lower-middle Proterozoic crystalline basement consists of the Gudongjin Group of the Changchen system and the Pingtoushan Formation of the Jixian system (Fig. 2). The Gudongjin Group in the area mainly includes quartz schist, biotite schist, and marble, which were metamorphosed up to amphibolite facies (Zhao et al., 2020). The Pingtoushan Formation mostly consists of quartzite, quartz schist, marble, quartz sandstone and siltstone. The lower Cambrian Shuangyingshan Formation crops out in the northern part of the region and is dominated by siliceous slate, quartzite and siliceous rock, which host Fe-Mn deposits (Fig. 2). The middle-upper Cambrian Xishuangyingshan Formation is characterized by shallow marine clastic sedimentary rocks consisting of siliceous slate, quartzite, and siltstone. The Lower-Middle Ordovician Luoyachushan Group mainly comprises slate, siliceous rock and quartzite interbedded with siltstone and limestone. The Middle Ordovician Xilinkebo Formation mostly consists of quartz sandstone and fine siltstone interbedded with siliceous rock, slate, quartzite and limestone. The Permian strata comprise two members. The lower Permian Hongliuhe Formation is characterized by bimodal volcanic rocks, consisting of basalt, andesite, dacite and rhyolite, while the upper Permian Loutuogou Formation comprises mainly clastic rocks. The Miocene Kuche Formation is dominated by mudstone, siltstone and conglomerate (Liu, 2019).\nThe main geologic structures of the Qingbaishan mining area are nearly E\u2013W-trending and NE-trending faults and folds. The nearly E\u2013W-trending Sanjiashan shear zone can be traced along a strike of more than 80\u00a0km and serves as the backbone structure in Qingbaishan (Fig. 2) (Zheng et al., 2019). Different kinds of granitoids, which mainly consist of monzonitic granite, hornblende granite, syenogranite, quartz diorite and granodiorite, are widespread in the area. Recent in situ zircon U\u2013Pb analyses have demonstrated that some granites were emplaced at 411.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u2013408.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0Ma (Fu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020), with minor amounts of A-type granites formed at 301.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0Ma (Fu, 2020).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\nThe Qingbaishan gold deposit is located in the southern part of the Qingbaishan area (Fig. 2) and hosted by the Sanjiashan shear zone. The main lithostratigraphic units in the Qingbaishan ore field are the Gudongjin Group of the Changchen system (Fig. 3\n), which mainly includes marble, quartz schists, mica quartz schists and silicalites. The orebodies at Qingbaishan are hosted in the Gudongjin Group of the Changchen system, which was metamorphosed to greenschist to amphibolite facies. Furthermore, some Early Devonian intrusions, including granodiorite and monzogranite, are present in the mining area (Fig. 3) (Zheng et al., 2019).\nThe Qingbaishan deposit is located in the Sanjiashan shear zone. A detailed field-based structural analysis revealed many structural deformation features in the Sanjiashan shear zone (Fig. 4\n), i.e., thrust structures and subsequent sinistral ductile shearing, which are associated with the orogenic process in Beishan. This deformation is first represented by a series of thrust-nappe structures, such as stacking structures (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, sinistral strike-slip deformation occurred along nearly E\u2013W-striking faults, and rocks in the mining area show a widespread mylonitic fabric, including an \u201cA\u201d-type fold (Fig. 4B) and stretching lineations (Fig. 4C). The stretching lineations are gentle and dip east at an angle of approximately 35\u00b0. The hinge of the \u201cA\u201d-type fold strikes in the extensional direction of the shear zone. Sinistral kinematics are inferred from asymmetrical folds (Fig. 4D) and S-C fabrics, e.g., mica fish and book-inclined features (Fig. 4E-G). Undeformed granitoids occur along the sinistral mylonitic zone. Some granodiorites crosscut the \u201cA\u201d-type fold and yield zircon U\u2013Pb ages of approximately 393\u00a0Ma (Fig. 5\n) (Liu, unpublished data), suggesting that the time of the Sanjiashan sinistral shearing deformation was earlier than 393\u00a0Ma.\nAll gold veins in the Qingbaishan deposit are associated with late-stage Sanjiashan sinistral strike-slip faults. The auriferous quartz veins are hosted in nearly E\u2013W-striking fracture zones where these veins experienced ductile deformation (Fig. 6\nA). The largest vein is 270\u00a0m long, with a thickness of 1.0\u20135.3\u00a0m. It strikes 110\u00b0 and dips to the southeast at an angle of 86\u00b0. The other veins are generally 90\u00a0m long and 0.5\u20130.93\u00a0m thick, with an average gold grade of 1.48\u00a0g\/t. Microstructural faults also display ductile deformation from thin section observations of Qingbaishan samples. Undulose extinction and directional stretching are widely present in quartz samples (Fig. 6C). More strongly deformed samples contain ribbon-like quartz grains (Fig. 6D). The interiors of some quartz grains show microfractures during ductile deformation (Fig. 6E, F). Subgrain fabric, kink-bands and mica fish are also observed in quartz veins (Fig. 6G, H, J). In addition, feldspar underwent brittle deformation, which is characterized by book-inclined structures (Fig. 6I). Pyrite is surrounded by asymmetric quartz strain shadows (Fig. 6K). During ductile deformation, dynamic recrystallization and directional stretching of coarse-grained quartz (Qz1) resulted in the formation of fine-grained quartz (Qz2) (Fig. 6).\nThe main ore minerals are pyrite (Fig. 6B) and subordinate chalcopyrite, galena, and limonite. Pyrite occurs mainly as disseminated anhedral to euhedral grains (Fig. 6K, L) with a size of 100\u20131200\u00a0\u03bcm. The dominant gangue minerals are quartz, feldspars, muscovite, sericite, chlorite, ankerite, and calcite. In the Qingbaishan deposit, hydrothermal alteration is widespread, with quartz, muscovite, sericite, and sulfides as the main phases formed in wallrock alteration zones. Gold mineralization is closely associated with pyritization, greisenization and silicification. The paragenetic sequence of the Qingbaishan gold mineralization is summarized in Fig. 7\n.\n\n\n4\nSamples and analytical methods\n\n4.1\nMuscovite 40Ar\/39Ar dating\nOne muscovite sample for 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology was collected from an auriferous quartz vein in the trench of the Qingbaishan gold deposit (Fig. 3). Fine-grained muscovite crystals from sample D1956-5 were separated from the crushed auriferous quartz vein using conventional heavy liquid and magnetic techniques, handpicked under a binocular microscope, washed with distilled water in an ultrasonic bath and dried.\nThe cleaned muscovite grains, as well as the referencebiotitestandard ZBH-25 (132.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma; Sang et al., 2006), were irradiated for 15\u00a0h in the high-flux engineering test reactor (HFETR) facility at the Nuclear Power Institute of China. After a three-month cooling period, the\n39Ar and\n40Ar contents of the sample were determined using an Argus VI noble gas mass spectrometer and the\n40Ar\/39Ar incremental heating method at the Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology. All ages were calculated using 5.543\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\na\u22121\nas the total decay constant (Steiger and Jager, 1977). The reactor correction factors were (36Ar\/37Ar)ca\u00a0=\u00a03.539\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, (36Ar\/37Ar)ca\u00a0=\u00a08.735\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 and (40Ar\/39Ar)k\u00a0=\u00a07.98\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123. The mass discrimination factor was calculated according to the atmospheric argon ratio of 295.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 (Nier, 1950). The age uncertainty for each apparent age is given for 1\u03c3. Incremental heating plateau ages and isochron ages were calculated using ArArCALC ver2.4 software (Koppers, 2002).\n\n\n4.2\nIsotope analysis\nThe samples used for isotope analyses were selected from the auriferous quartz vein. The aggregates of quartz were separated from the specimens using pincers and then crushed into grains with a mesh size of 40\u201360. After panning and filtration, more than 10\u00a0g of clear mineral grains were picked for every sample under a binocular microscope. To eliminate other interlocking minerals (e.g., sulfides), quartz separates were soaked in an HNO3 solution at 60\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h and rinsed with deionized water. The separates were treated 6 times using a supersonic centrifugal filter and rinsed with deionized water over a week. The samples were dried in an oven at 120\u00a0\u00b0C before analysis.\nThe oxygen, hydrogen and carbon isotopes were analysed on a Finnigan MAT253 mass spectrometer in the Analytical Laboratory, Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, using the methods outlined by Ding (1988). Oxygen gas was generated from the samples by quantitative reaction with BrF5 in externally heated nickel vessels. Hydrogen in the extracted water from the fluid inclusions within the quartz separates was replaced by zinc at approximately 600\u00a0\u00b0C and released for mass spectrometry. Carbon was measured on CO2 that was liberated from fluid inclusions in the quartz separates by thermal decrepitation under vacuum. The isotope data are reported in per mil relative to the Vienna standard mean ocean water (SMOW) for oxygen and hydrogen and the Vienna Peedee belemnite (PDB) standard for carbon. The total uncertainties were estimated to be better than \u00b10.2\u2030 for \u03b418O, \u00b11\u2030 for \u03b4D, and \u00b10.2\u2030 for \u03b413C. The results are presented in Table 2.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\n\n40Ar\/39Ar geochronology\nThe step-heating 40Ar\/39Ar dating results for muscovite collected from the auriferous quartz vein are presented in Table 1\n\n and Fig. 8\n. The uncertainties in the individual step-heating analyses and plateau ages are reported at the 1\u03c3 level. The 39Ar release profile shows a slight disturbance at all temperature steps (700\u20131400\u00a0\u00b0C) but produces a plateau age of 399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma (1\u03c3, MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.0) (Fig. 8A) during the last four steps. In the inverse isochron plot (Fig. 8C), an initial 40Ar\/36Ar ratio of 387\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0127 is obtained, which overlaps with the atmospheric value (298.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31; Lee et al., 2006). The inverse isochron age and normal isochron age are 399.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.3; Fig. 8C) and 399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.4; Fig. 8B), respectively, which are consistent with the plateau age.\n\n\n5.2\nC-H-O isotopes\nThe analytical data on the oxygen, hydrogen and carbon isotopes of Au-bearing quartz are presented in Table 2. The results show that the Au-bearing quartz yields a narrow \u03b418O range of 13.2\u201313.5\u2030 and has an average value of 13.4\u2030. The measured \u03b4D values of the fluids in Au-bearing quartz vary between \u221297\u2030 and \u2212107\u2030, with an average of \u2212103\u2030. The measured \u03b413CCO2 values of the fluid inclusions are generally negative and homogeneous. The \u03b413CCO2 values from the Qingbaishan deposit vary from \u22127.0 to \u22129.9\u2030, with an average of \u22128.9\u2030 (Table 2).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nCharacteristics of ore-forming fluids\n\n6.1.1\nHydrogen and oxygen\nThe \u03b418O values of the Au-bearing quartz from the Qingbaishan range from 13.2 to 13.5\u2030 and overlap with those of the Xiaoxigong gold deposit hosted by Precambrian metamorphic rocks in the Beishan orogen (9.6\u201314.2\u2030; Nie et al., 2003a; Liu and Pan, 2006) (Fig. 9\n). They are also consistent with those of Precambrian metamorphic rock-hosted orogenic gold deposits worldwide (Fig. 9; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012b; Zhou et al., 2014a, 2015). However, these \u03b418O values are generally lower than those of other gold deposits in the Carboniferous metavolcanic-sedimentary sequence or granodiorite pluton in the Beishan orogen (14.0\u201320.4\u2030, except for one value\u00a0=\u00a013.0\u2030; Zhang et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2021) as well as deposits hosted in Paleozoic sedimentary sequences from the western Qinling orogenic gold belt and southwestern Tianshan orogenic gold belt in China, where the \u03b418O values mainly range from 16.8 to 22.7\u2030 (Li et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2014b, 2022; Zhang et al., 2021) (Fig. 9). The fluids for orogenic gold deposits are widely accepted to be deeply sourced and widespread over the entire orogenic belt (Groves et al., 2018). Fluids that flow into Precambrian rocks react with the host rocks, which leads to low \u03b418O values of quartz formation because Precambrian rocks are poor in 18O and have a low crustal maturity. Hence, from the regional viewpoint, we suggest that the host rock chemistry, stratigraphy, and age are all quite efficient as controls on the isotope composition of quartz. The \u03b4D values of \u221297\u2030 to \u2212107\u2030 from the ore fluids at Qingbaishan fall into the \u03b4D range of those of the Juneau gold belts, Alaska (\u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221248 to \u2212110\u2030; Goldfarb et al., 1991), indicative of a metamorphic origin.\n\n\n6.1.2\nCarbon\nThe \u03b413CCO2 values of the ore-forming fluids trapped in the Qingbaishan deposit vary narrowly from \u22127.0 to \u22129.9\u2030, with an average of \u22128.9\u2030 (Table 2). These \u03b413CCO2 values are higher than those of organic matter (\u221227\u2030) but close to those of dissolved CO2 in fresh water (\u22129 to \u221220\u2030; Hoefs, 1997), atmospheric CO2 (\u22128\u2030; Schidlowski, 1998), mantle rocks (\u22125 to \u22127\u2030; Hoefs, 1997), igneous rocks (\u22123 to \u221230\u2030; Hoefs, 1997), and continental crust (\u22127\u2030; Faure, 1986), showing the complexity of carbon sources. The study of orogenic gold deposits implies that \u03b413C values ranging from \u221210 to 0\u2030 do not solely reflect a mantle or magmatic source (Kerrich, 1991) but also indicate metamorphic devolatilization of greenstone belts or metasedimentary rock terranes (Kerrich and Fyfe, 1981; Groves and Phillips, 1987). The \u03b413CCO2 values (\u22127.0 to \u22129.9\u2030) of the Qingbaishan deposit fall into the \u03b413C range of typical orogenic gold deposits (13CCO2\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210 to \u22120\u2030, Goldfarb et al., 2005) and are comparable to those of many orogenic gold deposits from the Qinling gold belts in China, the Abitibi gold belts in Canada, and the Bendigo gold belts in Australia, such as the Qiangma (\u22121.8 to \u22124.2\u2030; Zhou et al., 2015), Huangchanggou (\u22122.7 to \u22125.5\u2030; Zhou et al., 2014b), Central and North Deborah (\u22125.5 to \u22129\u2030; Jia et al., 2001), Malartic (\u22126 to \u22128.5\u2030; Kerrich et al., 1987), New Cambrian and Maxwells (\u22123 to \u22128\u2030; Gao and Kwak, 1995) deposits. Hence, these results also indicate that the Qingbaishan deposit is an orogenic-type system.\n\n\n\n6.2\nTiming of gold mineralization\nPetrographic observations reveal that muscovite is closely associated with Au-bearing pyrite and quartz (Fig. 6B) and occurs as mica fish in ductile deformed quartz veins (Fig. 6J), suggesting that these minerals formed from the same hydrothermal and structural deformation events. The analyses of muscovite from the auriferous quartz vein yield an\n40Ar\/39Arplateauage of 399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma, indicating that gold mineralization in the Qingbaishan deposit occurred around 399\u00a0Ma. This mineralization age is consistent with the timing of regional Sanjiashan ductile shearing determined from undeformed granodiorite (>393\u00a0Ma; Liu, unpublished data) (Fig. 5). Hence, the gold mineralization event is considered to be coeval with the Sanjiashan sinistral shearing, further determining a syndeformational origin for the deposit and implying a continuous tectonic-hydrothermal process during the Early Devonian.\nThe muscovite Ar-Ar data for gold mineralization at the Qingbaishan deposit have significant regional implications for the Beishan metallogenic belt because mineralization in this region, as reported by some authors (e.g., Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008b; Xu et al., 2021), is mainly dated to the early Permian to Triassic (298\u2013231\u00a0Ma). Therefore, the age (399\u00a0Ma) presented here for the first time provides a direct constraint on an Early Devonian mineralization event in this region. Apart from the Qingbaishan deposit, there are no other 399\u00a0Ma gold deposits in the Beishan area; thus, to the best of our knowledge, 399\u00a0Ma represents an important pulse for gold mineralization since the time when regional-scale sinistral ductile shearing developed in the Devonian in the Beishan and adjacent areas, such as the Central Tianshan (ca. 399\u00a0Ma; Li et al., 2020) and Southern Tianshan (393\u2013366\u00a0Ma; Deng et al., 2006). Moreover, large-scale syncollisional tungsten mineralization also occurred during the Silurian and early Carboniferous (424\u2013314) in the Beishan area (Nie et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2008a, b, 2010; Ding et al., 2017), indicating that the continental collisional orogenesis of this district between the early Silurian and early Carboniferous offered a favourable tectonic regime for polymetallic mineralization.\n\n\n6.3\nMetallogenic type and tectonic implications\nThe Qingbaishan deposit displays geological and geochemical features similar to those of typical orogenic-type deposits. The orebodies at Qingbaishan formed synchronously during the Devonian continental collision in the Beishan orogen. The syndeformational mineralization controlled by ductile shear zones and faults is related to syncollisional sinistral motion (>393\u00a0Ma, unpublished data), the latter of which is contemporaneous with the mineralization age. The mineralization styles are dominated by quartz veins, with hydrothermal alteration including sulfidization, silicification, chloritization, sericitization, and carbonation. These characteristics, together with the isotope signatures addressed above, indicate an orogenic gold system (Groves et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005b, 2008, 2012a) similar to the orogenic gold deposits hosted in Precambrian cratons worldwide (Fig. 9); however, these deposits mostly formed in the time intervals of 2.8\u20132.55\u00a0Ga and 2.1\u20131.8\u00a0Ga in compressional to transpressional tectonic regimes coupled with metamorphism during craton stabilization (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001, 2005). In contrast, the Qingbaishan deposit in the Beishan metallogenic belt formed during the late Paleozoic orogeny (Devonian), although it is hosted in Proterozoic metamorphic rocks.\nDuring the late Silurian to the Devonian, the Paleo-Asian Ocean between the Tarim and Kazakhstan\u2013Ili plates closed (Zuo et al., 2003; He et al., 2005), and the Beishan orogenic belt was involved in subduction-accretionary orogeny (Xiao et al., 2004). Syncollisional granitoids with ages of 424\u2013354\u00a0Ma have been found in the Beishan orogenic belt and are mainly characterized by peraluminous and calc-alkaline natures (Ding et al., 2017), as exemplified by the Qingbaishan (411.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u2013408.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0Ma; Fu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020), Baixianishan (379.7\u2013405.4\u00a0Ma; Yang et al., 2008b), Guoqing (422.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8\u2013392.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055\u00a0Ma; Yang et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2017), Yingzuihongshan (424.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u2013398.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0Ma; Yang et al., 2008a; Ding et al., 2017), and Jinwozi (429.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u2013354\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0Ma; Chen et al., 1999; Cong et al., 2012) plutons. The Qingbaishan deposit, with an age of 399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma, can be interpreted to have formed in a syncollisional environment caused by continental collision between the Tarim and Kazakhstan\u2013Ili plates, which is similar to the setting of the 424\u2013314\u00a0Ma tungsten deposits from the Beishan area (e.g., Ding et al., 2017). During the collision between the Tarim and Kazakhstan\u2013Ili plates in the Devonian, a series of thrust-nappe faults developed via compression. Along with the tectonic transition from compression to sinistral strike-slip motion, this process led to sinistral ductile shear deformation on related A-type folds and low-angle stretching lineations. Although the fluids for orogenic gold deposits are suggested to be deeply sourced and widespread over the entire orogenic belt (Groves et al., 2018), the permeabilities of crustal rocks are too low to generate ore formation on realistic timescales unless rocks experience deformation (Blenkinsop et al., 2020). Hence, deformation of >393\u00a0Ma provided favourable places for the migration of ore fluids and precipitation of the transported elements, and deep-seated metamorphic ore fluids migrated upwards along the Sanjiashan ductile shear zone and its subsidiary faults to levels with lower pressures to form the Qingbaishan gold orebody (Fig. 10\n).\n\n\n6.4\nImplications for regional gold metallogenesis\nIn the Paleozoic era, various kinds of mineral deposits formed in the Beishan orogen associated with coeval magmatism, which suggests that the Paleozoic era was a significant metallogenic interval (Xiao et al., 2010). Permian\u2013Triassic mineralization is well documented and characterized by W ore belts (e.g., Xiaobaishitou, Liushashan and Yushan; Nie et al., 2002, 2003b; Deng et al., 2017; Ding et al., 2017) and orogenic Au ore belts (e.g., Jinwozhi and Daqingshan; Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008a; Xu et al., 2021). In addition, lower Silurian-lower Carboniferous W and Cu deposits have also been reported in the Beishan area (e.g., Nie et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2008a, b, 2010; Ding et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). However, except for Qingbaishan in this study, Devonian orogenic Au deposits from the Paleozoic era have rarely been reported in the literature. Based on published ages, as well as the results of this study, two gold metallogenic events have been identified in the Beishan orogen, as exemplified by the Qingbaishan deposit for the ca. 399.0\u00a0Ma system and the Jinwozhi, Daqingshan and Xiaoxigong deposits for the 298\u2013231\u00a0Ma system (Nie et al., 2002; Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008a; Xu et al., 2021). Generally, orogenic-type gold deposits are accepted to have formed in compressional to transpressional environments in accretionary or collisional orogens (Chen and Fu, 1992; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2003; Chen, 2006, 2013). In addition, many examples show how strike-slip shearing at a variety of scales may be important for the genesis of such deposits (Blenkinsop et al., 2020). Strike-slip deformation in the Beishan orogen took place during the Early Devonian, as recorded by sinistral motion along Sanjiashan faults (Fig. 4B-F), and after the end of the Carboniferous, as recorded by dextral strike-slip shear zones (Coleman, 1989; Windley et al., 1990; Chen et al., 2005a). Two similar age groups of strike-slip structures are widely recognized in adjacent orogens, such as the Central Tianshan (ca. 399\u00a0Ma; Li et al., 2020), Southern Tianshan (393\u2013366\u00a0Ma; Deng et al., 2006; 295\u2013240 Ma; Huo, 2019), Northern Tianshan (ca. 290\u2013245\u00a0Ma; Zhou et al., 2001; Laurent-Charvet et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2008b; de Jong et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009). The ore-forming age (399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma) at Qingbaishan and the later 298\u2013231\u00a0Ma gold mineralization are separately consistent with the times of the two aforementioned strike-slip movements, and they may also be best classified as tectonic regimes of synorogenic and postorogenic strike-slip extension. Paleomagnetic data show that the Tarim plate drifted northwards in the Silurian and then obliquely collided with the Kazakhstan\u2013Ili plate before the Carboniferous (Jia, 1997), which resulted in the formation of a series of syncollisional strike-slip shear zones in Beishan, such as the Sanjiashan sinistral ductile shear zone. The syncollisional stage is also assumed to be responsible for the widespread emplacement of 424\u2013354\u00a0Ma syncollisional granitoids (Hu et al., 1986; Zhao and Zhang, 1987; Chen et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2008a, b, 2010; Cong et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2020) and the contemporaneous Qingbaishan Au deposit (Fig. 10). Furthermore, according to Tian et al. (2014), archipelago convergence and syncollisional crustal shortening in the Beishan area ended at the beginning of the Permian, and subsequent postcollisional crustal thinning began. This is proven by widespread postcollisional mafic\u2013ultramafic rocks and A-type granitoids with ages of 290\u2013220\u00a0Ma throughout the area (Li et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012; Pirajno et al., 2009). During postcollisional extension, the interaction between the plates was mainly lateral relative shifts, leading to large-scale strike-slip movements (e.g., the Xingxingxia dextral strike-slip ductile shear zone) and associated Au mineralization (e.g., Jinwozhi and Daqingshan) within the Beishan area (Xu et al., 2021).\nIn summary, the ca. 399\u00a0Ma and 298\u2013231\u00a0Ma gold events in the Beishan orogen were dominantly controlled by syncollisional sinistral and postcollisional dextral strike-slip faults, respectively, which also localized voluminous granitic rocks. Generally, large-scale strike-slip shear zones are considered to be the most favourable tectonic setting for hosting gold deposits and could represent reactivated structures (Vearncombe and Zelic, 2015). These reactivated structures are usually assumed to be more permeable and able to create sites of dilation for ore-fluid circulation (Holdsworth et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2021). In the reactivation process, the stress field switches from compression to tension (Carrier et al., 2000; Lebrun et al., 2017); repeated fluid-pressure fluctuations between lithostatic and hydrostatic values (Sibson et al., 1988) and variable degrees of weakening (Lawley et al., 2013) are believed to be related to the precipitation of ore metals.\nThe Beishan orogen offers a case to reveal adjacent deposits formed in two gold metallogenic episodes that developed at different times in diverse tectonic settings related to the multistage evolution of continental collision. Large-scale strike-slip shear zones in collisional orogens, e.g., the Beishan orogen, are indicated to be favourable locations for gold exploration, where multistage orogenic gold systems have developed. Many examples of lode deposits and goldfields associated with two orogenic episodes have also been reported worldwide, such as Sawayaerdun in southwestern Tianshan, China (Zhang et al., 2017); the Obuasi gold deposit in Ghana (Fougerouse et al., 2017); and the Bendigo-Ballarat goldfields in Australia (Wilson et al., 2013). A more recent example of multistage orogenic gold mineralization is offered by the ca. 46\u201342\u00a0Ma and 23\u201321\u00a0Ma deposits in the Jinping terrane in the Ailaoshan gold belt, China (Yang et al., 2021). Multiple orogenic gold mineralization events have taken place in different geodynamic settings and\/or structural regimes incomplex orogens; recognizing and understanding these complexities are critical for developing different exploration strategies to target orogenic gold systems, which involves clear recognition of their geodynamic setting (Fougerouse et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe Qingbaishan deposit is hosted in Proterozoic Gudongjin metamorphic rocks and controlled by the Sanjiashan shear zone and its subsidiary faults. Structural deformation in the Sanjiashan shear zone is characterized by thrust structures and subsequent sinistral ductile shearing, which is associated with mineralization.\n\n\n(2)\nThe muscovite Ar-Ar dating data show that gold mineralization occurred at 399.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0Ma, which is coeval with the Sanjiashan sinistral strike-slip deformation. The C-H-O isotope compositions indicate that the ore fluids were of metamorphic origin and the ore-forming materials were mainly derived from the Gudongjin Group.\n\n\n(3)\nThe Qingbaishan gold deposit is an orogenic gold deposit that formed during the continental collision between the Tarim plate and the Kazakhstan\u2013Ili plate. Compilation of the tectonic setting and mineralization ages for gold deposits throughout the Beishan orogen illustrates the occurrence of two metallogenic events: an early episode around 399\u00a0Ma during syncollisional sinistral strike-slip movement and a late episode around 298\u2013231\u00a0Ma related to postcollisional dextral strike-slip deformation.\n\n\n\n\n","27":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSandstone-hosted uranium deposits are one of the world\u2019s largest sources of uranium recoverable at low cost. The Tim Merso\u00ef Basin in Niger hosts the highest-grade and tonnage uranium ores in Africa, totaling 439 400\u00a0t U (OECD\/NEA, 2020; reasonably assured\u00a0+\u00a0inferred resource categories, recoverable at\u00a0<\u00a0USD$ 260\/kg U). Niger recently produces 5% of world U production and is the world\u2019s sixth-ranking U producer (World Nuclear Association, 2021), with cumulative production in 2017 of 77 228\u00a0t U from the Cominak underground mine for the Akouta mining district and 70189\u00a0t U from the Soma\u00efr open-pit mines for the Arlit district (Source: ORANO Niger internal data). With the future production at the giant open-pit mine of Imouraren expected to reach 5 000\u00a0t U per year, Niger could become the second-largest producer in the world. The main Uranium deposits in Niger (Arlit, Akouta, and Imouraren) are located in the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin, west of the A\u00efr Mountains. The Arlit and Akouta deposits are hosted in Carboniferous formations and host reduced uranium mineralization (predominantly U4+ minerals - uraninite and coffinite). In contrast, the Imouraren deposit, hosted by a Jurassic formation, is characterized by oxidized uranium mineralization predominantly U6+ vanadate (metatyuyamunite) and silicate (uranophane) minerals with some relics of reduced mineralization.\nWith the depletion of current resources and the declining uranium price, the major challenge for exploration and mining companies today is discovering high-grade uranium ores or moderate to low-grade ores economically recoverable. In the case of the Niger deposits, previous genetic models require updating to help search for extensions of the already known deposits. Thus, the search for new deposits is based on updated geological models integrating tectonics, fluid movements, pressure\u2013temperature paleo-conditions, and absolute ages of the U deposition. Identifying these parameters will allow predictive targeting of mineralization, potentially in areas not previously explored.\nThe Akouta uranium deposits have been the subject of several studies since the 1980\u00a0s. Inferred ages have resulted in four successive genetic models that differ in terms of ages and depositional processes. The first model involves a basin source of uranium. Devillers and Menes (1977) were the first to try to date the Akouta uranium mineralization. A Pb-Pb age of 338\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma was obtained, suggesting synsedimentary mineralization. Cazoulat (1985) proposed a uranium preconcentration stage (resulting in a small amount of U from leaching of A\u00efr crystalline basement rocks and the majority sourced from Ordovician volcanic rocks in the northern part of the A\u00efr Mountains) contemporary with Carboniferous sedimentation and deposition of uranium within fluvial and deltaic channel-fill sandstones with high organic matter contents (Fig. 1\na). The second model is based on a U-Pb age of 197\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063\u00a0Ma obtained on uraninite (Turpina et al., 1991) and suggested early remobilization of uranium from a preexisting synsedimentary source (Fig. 1b). The third model, proposed by Forbes (1989), involves a basin source of uranium and deposition of uranium by oxidizing processes within a diagenetic\/hydrothermal ore-forming system. According to this genetic model, the movements of the Arlit Fault would have caused a collapse of the western compartment allowing contact between the reduced Carboniferous formations to the east and the oxidized Permo-Jurassic formations to the west. The latter, very rich in volcanic ash, generated uraniferous fluids circulating from west to east to form uranium concentrations in contact with reduced formations (Fig. 1c). This mineralization event was dated by U-Pb method at 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0Ma by Forbes (1989) and was interpreted to represent the first stage of the ore deposition process. The fourth model mainly emphasizes the role of tectonics during the Cretaceous, but no absolute ages support this model shown in Fig. 1d (Gerbeaud, 2006). The latter study, carried out on a macroscopic scale in particular on the Arlit Fault, showed that the fault played a significant role, not only for vertical displacement of the fault but for enhancing diagenetic-hydrothermal fluid movements. An extensive network of fractures along a several hundred metres wide damage zone, a carbonate halo and cemented fractures are proofs of fluid flow along the Arlit Fault. The latter allowed fluids to rise or localized convection during different periods. Gerbeaud (2006) also showed that the uranium deposits lie directly east of the carbonate cement halo controlled by the Arlit Fault.\nPrevious U\u2013Pb age data available for the uranium oxides provided heterogeneous results. The timing of the mineralization in the burial history of the basin is therefore challenging to constrain. The objective of the present work is to date a series of representative samples from the uranium deposits, including those not previously dated (Arlit and Imouraren). The study objectives were to determine whether the uranium mineralization of Tim Merso\u00ef Basin was formed during a single diagenetic\/hydrothermal event related to a major geotectonic event or was polyphase over time.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Tim Merso\u00ef Basin, a sub-basin in the northeastern part of the Iullemeden Basin (NE of Niger, West Africa), is filled with Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments (Fig. 2\n). The basement underlying the sedimentary rocks comprises of metamorphic rocks of Cambrian and Precambrian age. The sedimentation of continental detrital material in the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin began during the Carboniferous, and the detrital sediments are considered to have been derived mainly from the A\u00efr Mountains (Valsardieu, 1971; Wagani, 2007). The A\u00efr Mountains are composed of Cambrian and Precambrian gneisses and granites, Devonian plutonic rocks, and annular volcanic complexes (Moreau et al., 1994) (Fig. 2). From the Permian to the Cretaceous, detrital material derived from erosion of the A\u00efr, Zinder, and Nigeria areas was transported from the South to the North and northwest (Wagani, 2007) and formed channel-fill sandstones, interbedded with floodplain mudstones. The Iullemeden Basin (including Tim Merso\u00ef Basin) is bounded by the Hoggar Massif in Algeria and the A\u00efr Massif in Niger, forming part of the Central Saharan Massif.\n\n2.1\nLithostratigraphy of the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin\nOver the basement, six stratigraphic groups deposited between the Visean and the Lower Cretaceous constitute the sedimentary sequence (Fig. 3\n).\n(1) The Terada Group (Lower Visean to Upper Visean), which includes mudstones, sandstones, and siltstones, is composed of two distinct mega-sequences (Valsardieu, 1971), characterized at the base by two fluvial and fluvio-lacustrine episodes (the Teragh and the Tindirenen Formations,Joulia, 1959), topped by a fluvial and fluvio-glacial episode (the Farazekat Formation, Valsardieu, 1971; Elhamet, 1983; Lang et al., 1991; Coquel et al., 1995), and ending with marine deposition of a continental platform (the Talak Formation, Joulia, 1959; Legrand-Blain, 1985; Crasquin-Soleau et al., 1987; Coquel et al., 1995).\n(2) The Tagora Group (Upper Visean to Namurian-Westphalian) is traditionally subdivided into two mega-sequences. The lower sequences start with the conglomerates of the T\u00e9l\u00e9flak Formation and the continental sandstones of the Gu\u00e9zouman Formation (Coquel et al., 1995) which hosts Akouta deposits, overlain by mudstones and sandstones of the Tchin\u00e9zogue Formation. Separated by a discontinuity, the upper series is composed of continental sandstones of the Tarat Formation (Valsardieu, 1971; Gauthier, 1972; Semp\u00e9r\u00e9, 1981; Semp\u00e9r\u00e9 and Beaudoin, 1984; Yahaya, 1992) which is the host of Arlit deposits, interbedded mudstones-arkoses sequence of the Madaouela Formation, and eolian sandstones of the Arlit Formation (Semp\u00e9r\u00e9 and Beaudoin, 1984). From T\u00e9l\u00e9flak toMadaouela, the sedimentary rocks are grey to black color with varying amounts of organic matter (plant material), Fe2+-sulphide (Semp\u00e9r\u00e9, 1981; Sanguinetti et al., 1982; Forbes, 1989) and iron-rich chlorite.\n(3) The Izegouandane Group (Permian) overlies the Tagora group and marks the appearance of the first detrital terrigenous red sediments of the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin, including intercalated volcaniclastic horizons. The aggregation of the metastable Pangea B (Irving, 1977) from the Permian, which evolves into a stable Pangea A in the Upper Permian (Scotese et al., 1988), leads to a global scale continentalization of sediments in most basins. The latter generated the deposition of red sandstone (arkoses) including in the Tim Merso\u00ef basin where these continental depositions began with the arkosic sandstones of the Izegouandane group (Pacquet, 1969; Valsardieu, 1971). From bottom to the top, the group consists of arkoses with lenses of red clays of the Izegouande Formation, mudstones and calcite-cemented brown sandstones of the T\u00e9jia Formation, siltstones and fine-grained carbonated sandstones of the Tamama\u00eft Formation, red mudstones rich in analcime of the Moradi Formation (Pacquet, 1969; Valsardieu, 1971), and minor channel-fill red sandstones that constitute the Aokar\u00e9 unit.\n(4) The Agadez Group (Triassic-Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous) overlies the Izegouandane Group, which consists from the base to the top of the Aguelal series, composed of conglomerates of the Anou-Mell\u00e9 Formation and fine-grained sandstones of the Teloua I Formation, followed by the Goufat series which comprises the arkoses of the Teloua II Formation and the multicolored analcime-bearing sandstones of the Teloua III Formation (Pacquet, 1969; Valsardieu, 1971). Next, these latter rocks are overlain by the Wagadi series, composed of the Mousseden unit represented by conglomeratic sandstones, the Tchirezrine I arkoses including intercalated clay horizons, and the Abinky Formation comprised of massive analcime-rich rocks (massive zeolite rocks). Finally, the Dabla series begins with abundant arkoses with analcime-rich intraclasts of the Tchirezrine II Formation which hosts the Imouraren deposits.\n(5) The Irhazer Group (Lower Cretaceous) comprises, at the bottom, the siltstones of the Assaouas Formation, and at the top, the mudstones of the Irhazer Formation.\n(6) The Tagama Group (Lower Cretaceous) constitutes the last fluvial sandstone deposits before the Upper Cretaceous marine transgressions.\n\n\n2.2\nTectonic evolution of the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin\nThe Tim Merso\u00ef Basin occurs as a regional-scale syncline with a fold axis trending north\u2013south. The basin is affected by a combination of brittle faults, mixed flexure-faults or low amplitude flexures. The early structures of the basement below the basin are related to the Pan-African orogenesis. They include a major north\u2013south-trending fault (the Arlit Fault, also known as Arlit-In-Azaoua), and a second grouping of faults oriented N30\u00b0, N70-80\u00b0 and N140-150\u00b0 (Fig. 2). The reactivation of the basement faults had repercussions in the overlying basin. Several authors mention a possible polyphase evolution of the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin (Guiraud et al., 1981; Yahaya, 1992; Yahaya and Lang, 2000; Gerbeaud, 2006), guided by a succession of extensional and compressive deformation phases. The Arlit Fault has a length of more than 100\u00a0km, and the largest uranium deposits are located along this major fault. The N30\u00b0 structures are expressed in the basement and are the most evident at the surface in the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin, where they result in the flexure of the overlying sediments. According to Hirlemann and Robert (1977, 1980), the N30\u00b0 structures are related to reverse strike-slip movements of the basement structures and were established during the Upper Cretaceous during a compressional regime with an N140\u00b0 shortening direction (Guiraud et al., 1981). The N140-150\u00b0 structures are expressed as right-lateral faults resulting from an East-West compression and are much less developed in the sedimentary cover. Many of them intersect Arlit Fault in the mining area. The N70\u00b0 structures are strike-slip faults which intensively intersect the basement and propagate into the basin, such as the significant Tin Adrar fault that is the boundary between the uranium districts of Arlit and Akouta. The Tin Adrar played a role in the distribution of the Tarat uranium deposits in the northern compartment and those hosted by the Gu\u00e9zouman in the southern compartment. Authors such as Valsardieu (1971), Yahaya and Lang (2000), and Gerbeaud (2006) have demonstrated the role of the N70\u00b0 structures in the sedimentation of Gu\u00e9zouman sandstones, particularly during the Visean. In the Tarat, the N70\u00b0 are slightly reactivated. The N140-150\u00b0 and N70-80\u00b0 structures are of late-Panafrican origin according to Greigert and Pougnet (1967).\nThe structures in the basement and their extension into the basin are currently quite well constrained. For example, Gerbeaud (2006) described their role in determining the fluid circulation and the architecture and location of the deposits at the mining district scale. Therefore, the N-S, N30\u00b0, and N70-80\u00b0 structures are therefore considered good pathfinders at a regional scale.\nAll of the exploited uranium deposits are located in the eastern compartment of the Arlit Fault (Fig. 2). Still, lateral extensions to the western side of the Arlit fault have also recently been discovered. Most uranium concentrations occur in river channel sandstones, especially within the coarser-grained facies.\n\n\n2.3\nGeology, alteration and mineralization of the deposits\nThe uranium deposits of the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin are located in the Tagora group for Arlit and Akouta and the Agadez Group for Imouraren, mostly in sandstones. Sandstones are made of monocrystalline quartz grains with minor fraction of polycrystalline quartz, feldspars, and micas. The heavy detrital minerals are zircon, apatite, monazite, tourmaline, rutile, iron oxide, and Fe-Ti oxides.\nThe Arlit deposits are hosted by the Tarat Formation (Fig. 3), which contains reduced fluvial sandstones and organic-rich clays and silts (Semp\u00e9r\u00e9, 1981; Elhamet, 1983; De Rouvre, 1985). Uranium mineralization is substantially in the form of variably coffinitized (coffinitization being the alteration of uraninite with the increase of Si content) uraninite associated with pyrite and minor amounts of U-Mo or U-Ti-(V) oxides within the sandstone porosity (Cavellec, 2006). The Arlit uranium ore, with an average grade of 0.2.8 % U3O8, is mined in open-pit mines at an average depth of 60\u00a0m (Fig. 4\na).\nThe Akouta uranium deposits occur within the Guezouman Formation (Fig. 3), composed of reduced fluvio-deltaic sandstones, particularly organic-rich channel formations (Forbes, 1989). The mineralization is represented dominantly by uraninite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0coffinite associated with trace U-Ti oxides and minor amounts of galena, chalcopyrite, molybdenum-vanadium oxide and iriginite. The uraninite occurs within the intergranular porosity of the sandstones or as plant material epigenization. The Akouta uranium ore has an average grade of 0.413 % U3O8 and is mined in an underground mine at a depth of 250\u00a0m (Fig. 4c and e).\nThe Imouraren uranium deposit, located 80\u00a0km south of Arlit and Akouta, is hosted by the Upper Jurassic oxidized continental arkoses and analcime-rich sandstones of the Tchirezrine II Formation (Pacquet, 1969; Valsardieu, 1971; Vallance, 2007). Uranium occurs as secondary U-minerals and some relics of primary U-minerals (Mamane et al., 2019). The primary uranium mineralization is represented mainly by uraninite accompanied by U-Ti-(V) oxides and Cu- sulphides, mainly chalcopyrite which was then altered or replaced later by chalcocite (Fig. 6g and 6\u00a0h). The secondary U-minerals result from in situ oxidation and alteration of previous uraninites (Fig. 5\n\n\nh). The uraninite and secondary U-minerals are present in several textural features and types of fill: i) in interstitial space, filling the intergranular porosity of the sandstone levels, ii) replacing the cores of analcime spheroids and also in between the analcime-rich layers, iii) in pseudomorphic replacement of analcime rims; and iv) in the albitized cleavages of potassic feldspars.\nWhile the Carboniferous formations in the North are preserved from paleo-weathering, in the South, the Jurassic formations at Imouraren were affected by intense continental weathering in western Africa from early Cenozoic to very recent times (Beauvais et al., 2008). The reactivation of regional faults, such as the Arlit Fault, during the collision between the African and Eurasian plates during the Late Cretaceous, at around 80\u00a0Ma (Forbes, 1989) would notably have led to a progressive uplift of the Imouraren series, in particular uplift of the Tchirezrine II Formation up to about 150\u00a0m below surface. Supergene alteration favored the formation of a significant quantity of secondary uranium minerals as well as hematite and goethite in the Imouraren Jurassic formations (Tchirezrine II and Abinky). The iron source is probably the oxidation of chlorite from Tchirezrine II and detrital Fe-Ti\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0V oxides from the underlying Abinky formation. The Imouraren deposit hosts a high uranium tonnage at a low-grade ore (0.06 % U3O8) and lies at a depth of 130\u2013150\u00a0m (Fig. 4g).\nThe Tim Merso\u00ef Basin sandstones show several pieces of evidence of burial diagenesis: i) compaction textures (pressure-dissolution and related quartz overgrowths, Fig. 5a), and ii) preferential dissolution of feldspars and the occurrence of chlorite precipitates on quartz overgrowths and in vugs developed on K-feldspars (Fig. 5a and 5b). The K-feldspars are strongly albitized in the Jurassic formations (Fig. 5c). The most common assemblages that infill the pores and dissolution vugs are quartz - chlorite - pyrite in the Carboniferous sandstones (Fig. 5d) and quartz - chlorite - albite -analcime in the Jurassic sandstones (Fig. 5e). In Carboniferous sandstones, chlorites occur in and around preexisting pyrite nodules (Fig. 5d). Some pyrite growth bands are discontinuous and corroded, attesting to the pyrite and the Fe-chlorite relationship. After quartz overgrowths, calcite and dolomite partially filled the porosity and microfractures.\nThe systematic study of mineral assemblages shows that chlorites are widespread in all formations from the Carboniferous to Late Jurassic and are the main clay constituent in the sandstones. In all cases, chlorites are embedded in the youngest growth bands of quartz (Fig. 5a). In the chlorite-rich samples from the three study districts, pitchblende was found as spherulites deposited onto chlorite flakes and cement around the chlorite (Fig. 5d). Illite developed later locally at the expense of chlorite and feldspars during uplift (Fig. 5f).\nThe pressure\u2013temperature conditions of the basin prior to uranium-oxide deposition, deduced from fluid inclusion (trapped in quartz overgrowths) and chlorite thermochemistry studies of quartz-chlorite assemblages, were estimated to be around 115\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C and 80\u2013120 bars and are remarkably similar in all formations from the Carboniferous to the Jurassic (Mamane et al., 2016).\nThe alteration profile is represented by a 600 to 800\u00a0m wide carbonate halo associated with a damage zone around the Arlit fault and adjacent areas from the carboniferous to the Jurassic formations. The predominant alteration products in this zone consist of chlorite to chlorite\u2013smectite mixed-layered phases, followed by a weak illitization (Fig. 5b and 5f).\nTwo facies are distinguished at Arlit and Akouta: (i) reduced facies sandstones composed of reduced grey sandstone rich in organic matter, pyrite, chlorite and blackish ore (uraninite), and trace to absent oxidation; and (ii) a reduced-oxidized facies composed of reduced grey sandstone with blackish ore following the laminae and moderate oxidizing alteration including hematite and minor yellow products resulting from meteoric alteration.\nIn Imouraren, we distinguished three facies which are: (i) minor reduced grey sandstone rich in sulphides, chlorite and blackish ore (uraninite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0U-Ti oxides) with trace to weak oxidation, and (ii) dominantly orange to red oxidized sandstone containing oxyhydroxides and yellow uranium ore (secondary uranium minerals) exclusively; and (iii) an intermediate facies composed of both the reduced grey sandstone and the oxidized sandstone.\nThe most probable source of uranium in the basin is linked to the intense activity within the A\u00efr crystalline rocks for the northern deposits (Arlit and Akouta) and the volcanism of the annular complexes of Nigeria for Imouraren further south. The deposits are classified as hydrothermal diagenetic uranium deposits (tabular or tectonic-lithologic sub-type) defined by Cuney (2009) because the distribution of the deposits is related to fault activity and local lithological factors. Tectonic movements control the distribution of the uranium mineralization around the Arlit Fault at a large scale. They created the paleo-topography which controls, in turn, the main directions of fluid flow and the slope of the permeable sandstone channels. Forbes (1989) highlighted the presence of an oxidized front (roll front) at Akouta. However, transitions are possible between these types of deposits. According to some authors (Rackley, 1976; Gabelman, 1977; Galloway et al., 1979), the roll front and tabular deposits share similar genetic processes and were formed at the beginning of the diagenesis.\n\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nExtensive sampling in the three districts (Arlit, Akouta and Imouraren) has provided high-quality core material for the study. Along the regional fault of Arlit, a representative deposit from each of the main districts has been chosen for this study (Fig. 2, Appendix 1): i) the Tamgak open pit area in the Arlit district, ii) the North Ebba area in the Akouta district, and iii) the Imfout Centre area in the Imouraren district. A summary of the characteristics of the studied samples is provided in Appendix 2.\nA cold FEG Hitachi S-4800 SEM microscope was used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and semiquantitative chemical analyses of minerals.\nElectron microprobe analyses (EMPA) of chlorites were obtained using a CAMECA SX100 electron microprobe equipped with a WDS detector (wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) on 11 representative thin sections at SCMEM (Nancy, France). Elements such as Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Mn, K, V, Ti, Na, and Ca were analyzed after calibration using natural and synthetic minerals or compounds such as albite (Si, Na), Al2O3 (Al), olivine (Mg), hematite (Fe), MnTiO3 (Mn), Co (Co), and NiO (Ni). A current of 12nA, an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV, and a counting time of 10\u00a0s were used. The analyses have a spatial resolution of 1 to 2 \u00b5m. The reproducibility of analyses was 1% for each element routinely analyzed.\nThe ages for uraninites were determined from measurements of the isotopes of uranium, lead and thorium by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The isotopic compositions were acquired with the ion microprobe CAMECA IMS-1270 at CRPG-CNRS at Nancy, according to the experimental protocol described by Deloule et al. (2002). The primary O- ion beam was accelerated at 13\u00a0kV, with a primary current intensity of between 10 and 25nA. The size of each analysis spot was 25\u00a0\u03bcm. The mass and energy calibrations were checked before each measurement after 2\u00a0min of pre-sputtering. The empirical linear relationship of Compston et al. (1984) was defined between UO+\/U+ and Pb+\/U+ on a Zambian uraninite dated at 540\u00a0Ma\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma as reference material, to determine the relative sensitivity factor for Pb and U used for samples. The correction for a common lead contribution was made by measuring the amount of 204Pb and then calculating the common lead composition utilizingutilizing the model of Stacey and Kramers (1975).\nIsotopic measurements of osmium and rhenium for chalcocite dating were conducted at the CRPG-CNRS laboratory in Nancy, according to the experimental protocol described by Cardon et al. (2008). Selected samples were crushed and chalcocites were then separated from the host rock by sequential handpicking, magnetic separation and heavy liquids. After the mechanical separation, about 300\u00a0mg of chalcocite mixed with appropriate quantities of the 190Os and 185Re isotopic tracers (spike), hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and hydrogen peroxide were introduced into a quartz tube for sample digestion. The quartz tubes were placed in a high-pressure asher (HPA-S, Anton Paar) and heated at 300\u00b0 C under a pressure of 130 bars, in order to achieve complete oxidation of the osmium to its highest oxidation state, thus allowing spike-sample homogenization. After sample digestion, following procedures adapted after Birck et al. (1997), Os was extracted into liquid bromine, whereas rhenium remained in the acidic solution. After addition of HBr, the Br2 was then evaporated and the osmium fraction was purified by microdistillation. Re was extracted from the acidic solution by anion exchange using chromatographic columns (AG X8 resin). Rhenium concentrations were calculated by isotope dilution from isotopic ratios meaured using an ICP-MS ELAN 6000. Purified Os samples were loaded on platinum filaments for analysis by negative thermal-ionization mass spectrometry (N-TIMS) (Creaser et al., 1991; V\u00f6lkening et al., 1991). Data were acquired in \u201cpeak jumping\u201d mode by ion counting using a Finnigan MAT 262 instrument, equipped with an electron multiplier and ion counting electronics and an oxygen leak valve. All data were corrected for blank contributions even if they are negligible compared to 187Re and 188Os amounts within the samples. The blank values are 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0pg for Re and 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0pg for Os. The total uncertainties given for the Re and Os ages include in-run uncertainties on the measurement itself, reproducibility of standards, uncertainties on the spike mass and uncertainty on the blank.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSample descriptions and chemical compositions of uranium oxides investigated by EMPA\n\n4.1.1\nArlit deposits\nUranium mineralization is substantially in the form of uraninite with minor amounts of U-Mo or U-Ti-(V) oxides. This reduced sandstone sample (9624-37A) was taken from the operating pit of Tamgak (Fig. 4a and 4b). SEM studies show that perfectly rounded spherules of uraninite are trapped within pyrite and Fe-chlorite cement (Fig. 6a). Table 1\n provides the chemical composition of these uraninites. The major elements U and Ca have constant values while values for Si show a significant standard deviation. However, the minor elements have very disparate values between analysis points. The U\u00a0+\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Ca versus Si binary diagram allows the differences in the chemistry of the different uraninites to be visualized. These samples show a low degree of Si substitution, 20% lower than the Si content of an ideal coffinite. Thus, Fig. 6a shows the spread of the chemical data between a uraninite pole and a coffinite pole.\n\n\n4.1.2\nAkouta deposits\nThe uranium mineralization is dominated by uraninite accompanied by a minor amount of U-Ti-(V) oxides. The uraninite mainly occurs as an interstitial filling of the intergranular porosity (sample 9624-18B). The average chemical composition and the standard deviation of uraninites are given in Table 1. For reduced facies, the areas selected for dating (Fig. 4c and 4d, sample 9650A-2B) were massive spherulitic uraninites (Fig. 6c). The chemical analyses demonstrate that U, Zr and V concentrations are relatively homogeneous between each analysis point, while conversely, Si, Ca, Ti, Pb and P are very variable.\nThe sample from a small redox front developed within the stratification (Fig. 4e and 4f) contains interstitial uraninite cement rich in euhedral pyrite inclusions (Fig. 6d). While the major elements (U, Si, Ca, and V) show relatively homogeneous values, the minor elements (Pb, P, Zr and Ti) display significant differences between analyses. In a U\u00a0+\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Ca versus Si diagram, microprobe analyses of uraninite cement plot along a line parallel to joining the uraninite and coffinite end-members.\n\n\n4.1.3\nImouraren deposits\nThe mineralized samples contain primary uraninite, secondary U-minerals and chalcocite (samples 9468\u20131, 9468-1B, 9467-1a, 9467-1b, 9650C-8B, 9650C\u20138C, VNI-76a, VNI-77, and VNI-88) while the barren samples are composed only of chalcocite (VNI-58, 9424\u201310 and 9424\u201314). A macroscopic photograph (sample 9468-1b) from a redox front is shown in Fig. 4h. The average chemical composition of well-preserved primary uraninites from the Imouraren deposits is given in Table 1. Major elements such as U, Ca, Si and P have relatively homogeneous values, whereas trace elements have very variable values. Silica concentrations vary between thin sections and even within the same thin section. Fig. 6c shows that data points distribute between the uraninite and coffinite end-members, shifting towards the coffinite end-member in samples VNI-76a and 9650C-8B.\n\n\n\n4.2\nGeochronology\n\n4.2.1\nUraninite U\u2013Pb ion microprobe dating\nArlit (sample 9624-37A): Table 2\n provides the results for twenty analyses of uraninite (Fig. 6a). The Concordia diagram obtained shows that the data points are all discordant except that at 124.3\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8\n). The 206Pb\/238U ages range from 65\u00a0Ma to 125\u00a0Ma and the average calculated age is 98\u00a0Ma. The diagram shows a shift of points both downwards and to the left, implying losses of radium (206Pb) and lead (206Pb and 207Pb), respectively. In such a case, the age at 124.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0Ma, a concordant age, would be more reliable. The significant discordance of the data is indicative of one or more episodes of lead loss.\nAkouta oxidized facies sample (9624-18B): In a Concordia diagram (Fig. 6d, Table 3\n), some points among the seven analyses of uraninite are highly discordant while others are concordant within error (Fig. 9\na). The data yield an upper intercept age of 112\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0Ma. In the interval 100\u2013140\u00a0Ma, the reported data are almost concordant and the mean 206Pb\/238U age for these points is 119\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0Ma, in agreement with the upper intercept age calculated over all points. The discordant points (at 31 and 69.8\u00a0Ma) indicate that the sample evolved in an open system and has lost the lead.\nAkouta reduced facies sample (9650A-2B): Twenty-eight analyses were performed on uraninite (Fig. 6c) and are reported in Table 4\n. The Concordia diagram shows that the points lie along with the Concordia, yielding an upper intercept age of 64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0Ma and a lower intercept age of 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9b). The 206Pb\/238U ages display the main peak at 50.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0Ma in a relative probability plot. The average 206Pb\/238U age is 46.9\u00a0Ma when excluding the four oldest ages (104.2, 83.5, 114.1, and 83.7\u00a0Ma) from a total of 24 points (Fig. 9c).\nImouraren reduced mineralization:\nSample 9468-1b: The thirty analyses of uraninite (Fig. 6b, Table 5\n) and the use of two geochronometers 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/235U both yield an age of 91.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10\na) and an average age of 92.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0Ma from the probability histogram (Fig. 10b).\nSample 9650C-8B: In the Concordia diagram, most of the data from sample 9650C-8B are discordant (Fig. 10c, Table 6\n). The U-Pb ages range between 7 and 20\u00a0Ma, and the Discordia line intercepts are at \u221234\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070\u00a0Ma and 76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0Ma. The significant errors on the intercepts result from the alignment of the data close and parallel to the Concordia line. It is also noticeable that if the age of formation of the uraninite was 76\u00a0Ma, a 70 to 90% loss of radiogenic lead should have occurred. Therefore, the period of 7 to 21\u00a0Ma with a mean age of 12\u00a0Ma, is the most plausible, as recorded by the 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/235U ages.\nSample 9650C\u20138C: This sample, which comes from the same drill hole as sample 9650C-8B, was analyzed along with a profile of 60 spots (Fig. 6f, Table 7\n). When reported in a Concordia diagram, the data points are all discordant (Fig. 10e) with a larger dispersion than 9650C-8B, pointing to open system behavior. The resulting Pb\/U ages range from 14 to 34\u00a0Ma with an average of 20\u00a0Ma, confirming the young age of the uraninites in sample 9650C-8B.\nThe mineralization of samples 9650C-8B and 9650C\u20138C is much younger than that of sample 9468-1b.\n\n\n4.2.2\nChalcocite Re\u2013Os dating\nRe\u2013Os measurements (Table 8\n) were carried out on eight chalcocite samples from Imouraren including five mineralized samples (VNI-77, VNI-88, 9467-1a, 9467-1b, 9468\u20131) and three barren samples (VNI-58, 9424\u201310 and 9424\u201314). Total Os concentrations are quite variable, from 2 to 83\u00a0ppb, due to the very large contribution of 187Os, but non-radiogenic Os contents are very low (\u22640.7\u00a0ppb) in nearly all samples. The data were plotted on a 187Os vs. 187Re diagram. As noted by Stein et al. (2000), this diagram is more suitable for extremely radiogenic samples than the traditional 187Os\/188Os vs. 187Re\/188Os diagram, as large uncertainties on the measurement of the low abundance isotope 188Os could profoundly influence these ratios. A rough correlation between 187Os and 187Re is observed (Fig. 11\na), which improves substantially if sample VNI-58 is excluded. This correlation yields an apparent age of 77.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0Ma (Fig. 11b). The very high initial 187Os content (1.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0ng\/g), which may vary from one sample to another, may explain some of the scattering of points around the correlation. This high initial 187Os content is coupled with a low 188Os content (on average 0.054\u00a0ng\/g, excluding VNI-58), yielding an initial average 187Os\/188Os ratio around 30. This high initial ratio may indicate a very high 187Os input when the chronometer was set, suggesting a preexisting phase enriched in Re that produced the radiogenic Os that was then incorporated into the chalcocite when it formed. Alternatively, this source of abundant 187Os around 77\u00a0Ma ago could correspond to a new input of copper associated with Re into the system through the circulation of hydrothermal fluids. Nevertheless, the pertinence and significance of the 77\u00a0Ma age should be viewed with caution as this age is primarily defined by two barren samples (9424\u201310 and 9424\u201314) taken from a drill hole located several hundred meters from the drill holes containing the mineralized samples (see locations in Appendix 2). Interestingly, the chalcocites from the mineralized samples are not enriched in Re, possibly suggesting that Re is retained by another phase, such as uraninite or organic matter, in this more reduced part of the section.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nCrystal-chemistry of uraninite\nThe Pb versus Si diagram shows that all uraninites from the three deposits (Akouta, Arlit and Imouraren) have suffered significant lead loss (Fig. 7d). The degree of coffinitization reaches 20, 10 and 25% at the Arlit (Fig. 7a), Akouta (Fig. 7b), and Imouraren deposits (Fig. 7c), respectively, but does not reach the coffinite end member (Fig. 7a, b, c, d). At Arlit, the gap between the analytical points and the theoretical curve joining uraninite and coffinite end-members is due to the presence of zirconium substituted for U, as in the uraninites from the Akouta reduced facies. At Akouta, the low substitution rate of Si, which does not reach 0.1 and is lower than that expected in a coffinite (0.5) indicates that these uraninites are well preserved. The shift between the two lines (Fig. 7b) is due to the substitution of U by Zr (reduced facies) and V (redox front). The uraninite from the Akouta redox front is in the process of coffinitisation, with a Si substitution rate that varies between 20 and 80%. The consequence of the coffinitisation is lowering the Pb contents to low values of 0.005 apfu (Fig. 7d).\nAs the oxidized lead losses could significantly disturb the U\u2013Pb isotopic systems, the less coffinitised samples were preferentially selected for dating.\n\n\n5.2\nSignificance of the ages\nThe isotopic compositions of lead in uranium oxides from different deposits show evidence of open-system behavior of the U-Pb isotopic system in most of the samples, resulting in a loss of radiogenic products of 238U and 235U. Considering 235U, one of these radiogenic products, 223Ra, has a very short half-life (T\u00a0=\u00a011.4\u00a0days) and is therefore nearly insensitive to time-dependant geochemical processes. The impact of its leaching on the 235U decay series will consequently be negligible. In the case of 238U, the radiogenic decay product 226Ra has a much longer half-life (T\u00a0=\u00a01622\u00a0years) and is thus more sensitive to such processes (Turpin and Leroy, 1987). The specific mobilities of Ra and Pb may result in a significant disturbance of the U-Pb system which appears to be a characteristic of the uranium deposits of the Tim Merso\u00ef basin. A deficiency in 206Pb will lead to overestimating 207Pb\/206Pb ages. In the U-Pb diagrams, when Pb is lost, such as is observed in sample 9624-18B, the Discordia line passes through the ordinate 0, while when both Pb and Ra are lost, such as in sample 9624-37A, the Discordia line does not pass through the origin (Fig. 8). Consequently, the ages given by lower intercepts are negative and have no geological significance. In such cases, calculating a Pb-Pb age yields unrealistic values, while the 207Pb age is more reliable. Similar results have previously been reported in studies of the Grants mineral belt (Ludwig et al., 1984) and the Lod\u00e8ve sedimentary deposits (Lancelot et al., 1984a, Lancelot et al., 1984b), where only radon loss was observed, and there was no lead loss. According to Turpin and Leroy (1987), these isotopic disequilibria (losses) are related to the geometry and texture of uranium minerals (porosity, fractures and size) and the composition (Eh, pH, carbon species, and sulphide) of the altering fluids, which control Ra and Pb leaching. Such processes occurred at the base of the Tchirezrine II formation at Imouraren, considered to be initially a reducing environment rich in sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite) and uraninite. It is composed of partly oxidized Cu-U assemblages resulting from a fluid-rock interaction favoring radon lixiviation (Mamane et al., 2019). Similarly, the Gu\u00e9zouman and Tarat Formations hosts the Akouta and Arlit deposits which formed in a reducing environment rich in organic matter and sulphides and probably experienced radon lixiviation related to a late hydrothermal fluid circulation.\nDating uranium minerals characterized by losses of radon and lead is not easy and requires thorough knowledge of the geological context. In the case of radium and lead loss, which will lead to a large spread of ages, intercepts in the Concordia diagram will have no geological significance. The 207Pb\/235U geochronometer provides the most reliable age. Late hydrothermal fluid events are probably the cause of the re-opening of the U-Pb isotopic systems.\n\nDevillers and Menes (1977) considered the Akouta mineralization to be synsedimentary in origin as they obtained a Pb-Pb age of 338\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma for the mineralization, in accord with the depositional age. This age of 338\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma was then rejected by Forbes (1989) because it was based on the hypothesis of closed system evolution of the 235U and 238U radiogenic descendants, a condition that is not fulfilled. Furthermore, the age of 197\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063\u00a0Ma proposed by Turpina et al. (1991) could either correspond to unrepresentative preconcentrations of uranium or a problem of interpretation. On the other hand, the age of 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0Ma of Forbes (1989) represents the first diagenetic\/hydrothermal mineralization stage. This age was obtained in the U-Pb isotope system (206Pb\/238U-207Pb\/235U) on massive uraninites from Akouta.\nIn the Akouta deposit (sample 9624-18B), the mean 206Pb\/238U age of 119\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0Ma for concordant points is coherent with the upper intercept age of 112\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0Ma derived from all of the data. Therefore, it is considered to represent the first stage of mineralization. The data from the sample 9650A-2B yield an upper intercept age of 64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0Ma and a lower intercept age of 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00a0Ma, with an MSWD of 40 (Fig. 9b). Such an age range suggests several stages of U deposition or an open U-Pb system over a significant time interval. The four oldest ages (104.2, 83.5, 114.1, and 83.7\u00a0Ma) correspond to the early formation of uraninite (Fig. 9c), while the main part of the sample either formed later or has lost its radiogenic lead at 64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0Ma. (Fig. 9c). The average 206Pb\/238U age of 46.9\u00a0Ma, therefore, represents remobilization of older uraninite.\nIn the Arlit deposit, only the concordant 207Pb age at 124.3\u00a0Ma is considered reliable due to Pb loss in the sample (Fig. 8).\nIn the Imouraren deposit, the concordant age of 91.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0Ma from sample 9468-1b (Fig. 10a) may correspond to the first stage of mineralization. The two discordant ages of 8\u201318\u00a0Ma and 14\u201332\u00a0Ma from samples 9650C-8B and 9650C\u20138C, respectively (Fig. 10c and 10e), may represent ages of remobilization. For sample 9650C-8B, the histogram of the relative probability of the experimental points shows a 207Pb\/235U mode towards 12\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10d). In this case, the apparent ages (the maximum 207Pb age) can represent the minimum ages because they all plot close to the straight part of the Concordia curve. Those 207Pb ages are less sensitive to lead losses and closer to the accurate ages. For sample 9650C\u20138C, the apparent 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/235U ages cover a similar period, from 14 to 32\u00a0Ma. These ages are a little older than, but still consistent with, the young ages (8 to 18\u00a0Ma) of sample 9650C-8B. The 207Pb\/235U ages range from 14 to 32\u00a0Ma, with a mean of 20\u00a0Ma. They likely correspond to the remobilization of a preexisting uranium concentration.\n\n\n5.3\nTiming of U-mineralization and genetic model of Tim Merso\u00ef uranium deposits\nThe U-Pb isotopic ages for the three deposits reveal one or more early ore stages during the Cretaceous followed by a series of uranium remobilization events and lead-loss over a period extending into the Cenozoic (Fig. 12\n). Textural, geometric and chronological relationships between minerals, have documented different stages of ore formation and alteration separated by tectonic breaks (Fig. 13\n\n). Thus, deposits formed thanks to active fluid movements in aquifers, controlled by local and regional tectonics. The main stages of the metal cycle (Source-Transport-Deposition) are presented in Fig. 15\n:\n\n\n(i) Burial diagenesis and telogenesis:\n The burial diagenesis phase is characterized by a diagenetic\/hydrothermal alteration attested by silicification as quartz overgrowth and potassium feldspars dissolution contemporary with the formation of iron-rich chlorite, chlorite\/smectite, albite, and euhedral analcime II for Imouraren. At the maximum burial, the quartz overgrowths are well-developed and uraninite was found as cement around quartz overgrowths and precipitated onto chlorite, which constitutes the primary cement in the sandstone. Thermobarometry of the quartz-chlorite assemblages from the Carboniferous to Jurassic sedimentary series, constrains the P-T conditions to 115\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C and 80\u2013120 bars, similar across all formations.\nCretaceous tectonic movements, synchronous with the main rifting stages of the Atlantic Ocean, are considered to be the leading cause of the abnormal heat flux and fluid convection around the Arlit Fault. Primary uraninites formed in the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin at that stage between\u00a0\u223c\u00a090 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0145\u00a0Ma. Studies conducted by Loule and Pospisil (2013) on the West and Central African Rift System (WCAS) showed a volcanic episode related to Aptian-Albian rifting in the Lower Cretaceous between 99 and 125\u00a0Ma under an oblique extension regime. This episode was synchronous with the beginning of crustal extension following the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent that commenced in the Neocomian (145\u2013130\u00a0Ma). This Cretaceous rifting occurred between 98 and 125\u00a0Ma (Genik 1991) and between 104 and 140\u00a0Ma (Heine et al., 2013). In Niger, in particular west of A\u00efr, several authors (Fairhead et al., 2013; Guiraud and Maurin, 1992; Guiraud and Bosworth, 1997) revealed a period of rifting and related it to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous during the separation of Africa and South America. Heine et al. (2013) presented a new plate kinematic model for the evolution of the South Atlantic rift from 140\u00a0Ma, the beginning of the extension, to 104\u00a0Ma, the point of the complete separation of the South American and African plates and the formation of the Atlantic Ocean. The study showed evidence for volcanic activity during that time in the Iullemmeden basin, particularly in its sub-basin, the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin, as shown in Fig. 14. The Lower Cretaceous was thus a time of significant geodynamic disruption in West Africa. The Tim Merso\u00ef Basin, located between the Atlantic rift and the West African Rift System (WARS), was potentially subjected to significant deformation and heat fluxes, responsible for mass transfers and uranium deposition. During this event, the paleo-temperatures and paleo-pressures in the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin formation mineralization were remarkably similar across all formations from the Carboniferous to the Jurassic and estimated to be around 115\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C and 80\u2013120 bars (Mamane et al., 2016). These temperatures were about 60\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C higher than those expected at the maximum burial depth attesting to a significant thermal disequilibrium between the incoming hot brines along the Arlit Fault and and reservoirs located within the high permeability sandstones. The proposed model suggests circulation of hot and highly saline waters (up to 22% eq. NaCl, Mamane et al., 2016) thanks to a convection system around the Arlit Fault during the Cretaceous Atlantic rifting and their introduction to different aquifers. The most probable origin of the brines is the Triassic formations. The patterns of fluid flow proposed by Frazer (2014) from simulations of the example of the Derbyshire Basin are almost entirely applicable to the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin: i) fluid expulsion from the deeper part of the basin, ii) expulsion and drainage of hot fluids along the faults and aquifers adjacent to the fault, iii) depressurization after pressure release and iv) initiation of the convection (refer to Mamane et al., 2016). These interactions are at the origin of water\u2013rock interactions in permeable formations and uranium deposition in favourable reduction trap transfer, leading to the genesis of world-class uranium deposits. The depth of ore formation and its location within fluvial and deltaic channel-fill grey sandstones rich in organic matter, Fe-chlorite and pyrite imply reduced conditions within the main reservoirs.\n\n\n(ii) Exhumation:\n After primary uranium mineralization events in the Cretaceous, the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin underwent a Cenozoic uplift distinguished by two events: (i) development of illite\/illite\u2013smectite and iron oxides, and (ii) a supergene event resulting in the formation of the secondary U-Cu minerals. Contrary to Carboniferous Formations preserved from oxidation, Jurassic Formations experienced oxidation episodes attested by abundant euhedral to sub-euhedral oxyhydroxides (Fig. 5g) cement or as coatings on detrital grains and clay matrix. The related secondary U-minerals formed during a period ranging from demonstrated that a series of U remobilization events took place between the Miocene to very recent times (U-Pb data in Mamane et al., 2019).\nU-Pb data on primary and secondary U-minerals from Imouraren (Mamane et al., 2019) suggest that the first U-ores underwent a series of later remobilization events yielding lead loss. At Arlit-Akouta, the reworking resulted in the formation of younger uraninites at around 50\u00a0Ma. At Imouraren, younger uraninites formed between 34 and 8\u00a0Ma under locally reduced conditions and were followed by secondary U-minerals from 21\u00a0Ma up to 3\u20131.6\u00a0Ma during supergene events. This process occurred at the boundary between the oxidizing fronts and the reduced environments due to water table movements during the main oxidation episodes in West Africa. The paleo-lateritic surfaces of West Africa, reconstructed by Grimaud (2014) showed that the oxidation not only affected the wetter areas located to the west and south-west, but even the driest areas like the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin. The chronology of the lateritic paleo-surface incision in West Africa, established by Grimaud (2014) is consistent with the U-Pb ages of the oxidized U-minerals. Petrographic observation suggests that the U6+ minerals formed during the latest oxidation event are compatible with the young U-Pb ages. The REE contents analysis of Imouraren U oxides revealed that the U4+ and their U6+ phases show similar REE patterns. Although relatively depleted in REE, the U6+ minerals mimic the U4+ mineral patterns, suggesting that the U6+ minerals were derived from U4+ mineral replacement (Mamane et al., 2019). These remobilizations are related to the uplift of the basin in post-uplift stages caused by the reactivation of large regional structures, such as the Arlit Fault, and the subsequent infiltration of fluids. This uplift event is also supported by the (U-Th)\/He thermochronological data (Rougier et al., 2013a) acquired from the Tuareg Shield, including the Hoggar Precambrian rocks (South Algeria) and the analogous rocks of A\u00efr (North Niger). The ages, ranging from 78 \u2212 22\u00a0Ma to 13\u20133\u00a0Ma, are consistent with Cenozoic episodes of ore-deposition or reworking in the Tim Merso\u00ef Basin and provide evidence for widespread Eocene exhumation of the Tuareg Shield before the volcanic activity began.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n\n\n\n1.\nThe Arlit, Akouta and Imouraren uranium deposits, hosted in the Tarat, Gu\u00e9zouman and Tchirezrine II formations, respectively, have in common spatial and lithological control of the ore deposition process at the scale of the deposit. Uranium deposition occurred in channels composed of medium to coarse-grained sandstones deposited in fluvial or marine environments. Fluid movements were favored by structural controls imposed by the major north\u2013south-trending faulting (the Arlit Fault) and by a secondary shearing network, oriented NNE-SSW (N30\u00b0) and ENE-WSW (N70\u00b0), and to a lesser extent by the WNW-ESE (N140\u00b0).\n\n\n2.\nNew U-Pb ages, together with crystal-chemistry of uraninite, obtained on samples from the three uranium deposits highlight two main episodes of uranium deposition and two contrasting mechanisms of formation: (i) a primary mineralization event between\u00a0\u223c\u00a090\u00a0Ma and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0145\u00a0Ma associated with the Atlantic Rift, which induced the deformation and diagenetic\/hydrothermal fluid flow responsible for mass transfers related to the formation of primary uraninite and chalcocite in a reduced environment; and (ii) a later series of remobilizations of primary uranium mineralization to form much younger uraninites under reduced conditions at Arlit-Akouta at around 50\u00a0Ma, and possibly under partially preserved reduced physical\u2013chemical conditions at Imouraren around 77.2\u00a0Ma (chalcocite stage), and then from 34\u00a0Ma to recent years, during Cenozoic exhumation of the basin and subsequent redox front developments and U and Cu supergene mineralization.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the deposits of Arlit, Akouta, and Imouraren share many geological similarities, including general structural setting, mineralogy, geochemistry, host rock association and the age of the mineralization. However, the Imouraren deposit is distinguished from other similar deposits by its size, low grade, the intensity of its alteration process, and the high degree of associated oxidative alteration.\n\n","28":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nNortheastern China is a globally important silver metallogenic province with\u00a0>\u00a065, 000 tonnes silver total resource (Hui et al., 2021a,b). These giant silver resources are mainly contributed by Ag-Pb-Zn-(Sn) multi-metal deposits, including (in order of Ag resources) Shuangjianzishan, Baiyinchagan, Jiawula-Chaganbulagen, Bairendaba, Halasheng, and Baiyinnuoer. Numerous geochronology, geochemistry, stable isotope, and fluid inclusion studies have been reported for the Ag-Pb-Zn multi-metal deposits in NE China (Li et al., 2014, 2015, Niu et al., 2016, 2017; Ouyang et al., 2013; Zhai et al., 2019, 2020). However, most previous studies use gangue or accessory minerals to obtain geochronological data and the physiochemical conditions and composition of ore-forming fluids, which only provide indirect constraints on ore-forming processes.\nAs the most important source and common ore mineral of zinc, sphalerite is an ideal medium for directly constraining the ore-forming process for the NE China Ag-Pb-Zn deposits. For example, sphalerite has a wide spectrum of trace elements (in order of atomic number): Mn, Fe, Cu, Ga, Ge, Ag, In, and Sn, which contain abundant genetic information (Tu and Gao, 2003; Cook et al., 2009; Frenzel et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2019). Sphalerite trace element data have been applied to assist in understanding genetic processes for a number of different deposit types, including MVT Pb-Zn deposits (Zhuang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021), skarn deposits (Xu et al., 2020; Xing et al., 2021), submarine hydrothermal sulfides (Wu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), epithermal deposits (Bauer et al., 2019; Slater et al., 2021) and metamorphosed Pb-Zn deposits (Cugerone et al., 2020). In addition, sphalerite trace element data have been used to indicate the composition (Scott and Barnes, 1971; Browne and Lovering, 1973; M\u00f6ller, 1987; Keith et al., 2014; Lockington et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2018), evolution, and physiochemical conditions of ore-forming fluids as well as the processes that result in ore deposition (Pfaff et al., 2010, 2011; Cook et al., 2013; Gagnevin et al., 2014; Rottier et al., 2016).\nTherefore, interpretation of trace element compositions of sphalerite can aid understanding of the genesis of the Halasheng Ag-Pb-Zn deposit. This deposit has well-defined basic geological parameters (Wang and Qin, 1989; Li and Meng, 2003; Sun and Zhang, 2009; Li and Shuang, 2012; Wang et al., 2019a), geochronology, and tectonic setting (Han et al., 2020). Both skarn type and vein-type hydrothermal mineralization are developed in the Halasheng ore district, with both mineralization types containing sphalerite with variable textures, thus providing a good opportunity to constrain the genesis of the ores using critical data resident in sphalerite within the deposit.\nIn this study, in situ Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used to analyze the minor\/trace element contents and in-situ sulfur isotope ratios of sphalerite, in combination with sulfur isotope ratios of galena, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite in different mineralization stages of the formation of the Halasheng deposit. The paper records 1) different textures of sphalerite from skarn and hydrothermal vein-type mineralization; 2) variations in geochemistry and sulfur isotope ratios of different generations of sphalerite; and 3) the nature and evolution of ore-forming fluids deciphered through analysis of sphalerite geochemistry. These are, in turn, used to constrain the mineral deposit classes into which the Halasheng deposit falls and speculate on which other synchronous deposit types could be present in the ore district.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Halasheng Ag-Pb-Zn deposit is located in the southern part of the Erguna Block (EB), in the Eastern Domain of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB; Fig. 1\na, b).\nIn the Paleozoic, the Paleo-Asian tectonic regime controlled the amalgamation of microcontinental blocks in NE China. The EB collided with the Xing\u2019an Block (XB) at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0490\u00a0Ma along the Xiguitu-Xinlin-Huma suture (Ge et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2017). In the Mesozoic, the tectonic regimes of the Mongol-Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific orogenies impacted the EB and caused intensive intermediate-felsic magmatism (Seng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Wu et al., 2011; Ge et al., 2005; Windley et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2009, 2013; Tang et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019). Mesozoic volcanic rocks including the Manketou'ebo, Tamulangou, Shangkuli, and Ilikede formations are widely distributed in the region (Meng et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2009, 2013). Major granites (used sensu lato throughout) and minor intermediate-mafic rocks comprise the majority of the Mesozoic intrusions (Wu et al., 2011; She et al., 2012). They can be divided into three stages: 1) Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic (246\u2013180\u00a0Ma); 2) Early to Middle Jurassic (180\u2013160\u00a0Ma); and 3) Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (155\u2013123\u00a0Ma) (Wu et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). A series of porphyry Cu-Mo\/Cu deposits, and hydrothermal vein-type Ag-Pb-Zn\/Ag deposits have been discovered in the Erguna Block (Fig. 1b; Qin et al., 1990, 1995, 1997; Wu, 2005; Chen et al., 2010). Current knowledge indicates that the known porphyry Cu-Mo\/Cu deposits formed in the Late Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic in a subduction to collisional tectonic regime, and that discovered hydrothermal vein-type Ag-Pb-Zn deposits formed in the Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous in a post-orogenic extensional environment related to the Mongol-Okhotsk geodynamic regime (Chen, 2010; Li et al., 2014; Mi et al., 2016; Niu et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Han et al., 2020). The hydrothermal vein-type Ag-Pb-Zn deposits are associated with Mesozoic felsic intrusions and volcanic rocks (Qin et al., 1995, 1997; Niu et al., 2017; Han et al., 2020).\n\n\n3\nOre deposit geology\nThe ore bodies of the Halasheng Ag-Pb-Zn deposit are mainly hosted in rhyolitic tuff, argillaceous siltstone, and coarse-grained sandstone of the upper Jurassic Manketou'ebo Formation (Figs. 2, 3\n\n). The Manketou'ebo Formation is underlain by a series of andesite, andesitic basalt, and andesitic breccia of the middle Jurassic Tamulangou Formation. The lower Cambrian Ergunahe Formation comprises marble, greenschist, and phyllite, locally distributed below the unconformable overlying Tamulangou Formation (Han et al., 2020). Skarns and skarn-related Zn-Cu mineralization are developed at the contact between the Tamulangou and Ergunahe Formations (Fig. 3a). The dominant intrusive rocks in Halasheng district are Early Cretaceous quartz monzonite, granite porphyry, and granite, dated by U-Pb in zircon at 134\u2013128\u00a0Ma (Han et al., 2020). The imprecise sphalerite Rb-Sr age is 122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma, which indicates that Halasheng also formed in the Early Cretaceous (Han et al., 2020), and overlaps with the more precise ages of the granite intrusions. North- and NNW-trending normal faults are the major ore-hosting structures for the Halasheng ore bodies (Fig. 2).\nSoil chemical and geophysical exploration surveys have revealed six geochemical anomalies in the Halasheng ore district, among which the Ht-II geochemical anomaly has been the main target for exploration (Fig. 2). Two mineralization types have been identified: rare skarn mineralization and dominant vein-type and stockwork hydrothermal mineralization (Figs. 4, 5\n\n).\n\n3.1\nSkarn mineralization\nSkarn bodies have been revealed by drilling between exploration lines 4 to 15, while their east\u2013west extent has not been defined (Fig. 3). Skarn mineralization has been intersected between exploration lines 0 to 7 by drill holes ZKIV003 and ZKIV-703, occurring as concealed ore bodies underlying the #4-6 ore body (Fig. 3). The skarn ores are mostly vein-like (Fig. 4a) within a known length of 200\u00a0m, with a NW trend and dip to the NE. The deposit occurs from 38 to 122\u00a0m below surface with average grades of Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ag of 2.17%, 1.35%, 0.030%, and 82.411\u00a0g\/t respectively (706 team of Heilongjiang Nonferrous Metal Geological Exploration). Host rocks to the skarn mineralization are andesite and marble. Skarn mineralization can be divided into a garnet-cummingtonite skarn stage and a quartz-sulfide stage dominated by sphalerite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite, with minor galena, and accompanied by rhodochrosite, quartz and calcite (Fig. 5).\n\n\n3.2\nVein-type hydrothermal mineralization\nIn the Ht-II geochemical anomaly area and Wt-IV geophysical anomaly area, two main groups of ore veins (#3 and #4), have been identified (Figs. 2, 3). The main lode of the Halasheng deposit, the #3-1 ore vein, accounts for most of the metal resource. The concealed #3-1 ore vein strikes nearly N-S, but locally strikes NE-SW to NNW-SSE, consistently dipping 30\u201385\u00b0 east (Figs. 2, 3a, b). The #3-1 ore vein has an average true thickness of 1.9\u00a0m, and is Pb-rich, with an average Ag grade of 215.11\u00a0g\/t, Pb grade of 4.28%, and Zn grade of 0.64% (706 team of Heilongjiang Nonferrous Metal Geological Exploration). Illite and hydromuscovite are the major alteration minerals symmetrically surrounding the Ag-Pb-Zn veins (Fig. 4e), and rhodochrosite is the dominant gangue mineral intergrown with the Pb-Zn sulfides (Fig. 4c, d). Vein-type hydrothermal mineralization includes massive Ag-Pb-Zn ores, stockwork Ag-Pb-Zn ores, veinlet-disseminated Pb-Zn ores, and oxidized ores. Ore minerals includes galena, sphalerite, bournonite, tetrahedrite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and silver-sulfosalt minerals.\nBased on crosscutting relationship, three stages have been recognized for vein-type Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization. Stage 1 is represented by a Fe-As-S element association, with a dominant assemblage of pyrite-arsenopyrite-quartz-illite. Arsenopyrite and pyrite occur as coarse-grained, euhedral crystals in veins or as fine grains disseminated in wall rocks. Locally, arsenopyrite may parallel or crosscut bedding in the host tuff (Fig. 4b). Based on textural relationships, Stage 2 represents a Pb-Zn-Cu-Fe-S association, which is the major stage of Pb-Zn mineralization. Pyrite aggregates formed in Stage 1 are enveloped in galena-sphalerite-bournonite veins (Fig. 4f). Stage 2 is dominated by coarse-grained galena, sphalerite, bournonite, tetrahedrite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite, accompanied by rhodochrosite and quartz (Fig. 4c, d, e). Alteration minerals are illite and hydro-muscovite (Fig. 4e). Stage 3 with an Ag-Pb-Zn-Sb-S association represents the major phase of Ag mineralization. It consists of a mineral assemblage of Ag-bearing sulfosalts-falkmanite-sphalerite-galena-quartz, in the form of sulfosalt-sulfide-quartz veinlets that crosscut the coarse-grained galena-sphalerite-rhodochrosite veins (Fig. 4f), or replace earlier sulfide minerals (Fig. 6\ng, h).\n\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical methods\n\n4.1\nSample description\nIn this study, 22 samples from 12 drill holes and 5 samples from the 670 and 750 level in the underground mine were collected for sphalerite trace-element and sulfide in situ sulfur isotope analysis. Samples were taken from five drill holes and underground mine samples in a NS-trending cross-section along the major #3-1 vein, with other samples taken from five other drill holes that intersect the deeply concealed #4-1 and #4-6 vein.\nThe fresh ore samples contain sphalerite and other sulfide and\/or sulfosalt minerals formed at different stages of mineralization. Double-polished, 100\u00a0\u03bcm-thick, thin sections are used for both description and analysis.\n\n\n4.2\n\nIn situ LA-ICP-MS trace element analysis\nLA-ICP-MS analysis of sphalerite was conducted at CODES Analytical Laboratories within the Centre for Ore Deposit and Earth Sciences (CODES), at the University of Tasmania. Staff of CODES Analytical Laboratories performed the analyses and data reduction, including all necessary isotopic mass interference corrections. Staff of CODES Analytical Laboratories have not contributed to data interpretation. Further details on analytical procedures can be obtained from CODES Analytical Laboratories.\n\n\n4.3\nSulfur isotope analysis\n\nIn-situ sulfur isotope ratios of sulfides were analyzed in polished thin sections using a Nu Plasma II MC ICP-MS, equipped with the 193-nm excimer ArF laser ablation system at GPMR, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). The diameter of the laser beam was 33\u00a0\u03bcm with a repetition rate of 10\u00a0Hz and an energy fluency of 3\u00a0J\/cm2. Each data point was acquired for 40\u00a0s for the 34S and 32S isotopic species. In-house pyrite standard WS-1 and sphalerite NBS-123 were used as certified reference materials. The analytical precision is better than 0.5\u2030. Detailed analytical conditions and procedures are given in Zhu et al. (2017).\nWhole-rock sulfur isotope analysis was conducted on crystalline limestone of the Ergunahe Formation at the Beijing Geological Research Institute of Nuclear, using a Delta v plus gas isotope ratio mass spectrometer.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nParagenetic sequence for sphalerite\nSphalerite is one of the dominant ore minerals in the Halasheng deposit in both skarn and vein-type hydrothermal mineralization. It has a variety of textures in different depositional generations. In terms of the different mineralization types and ore stages detailed above, three types of sphalerite can be distinguished:\nSpS, represents sphalerite in concealed skarn mineralization in the Wt IV anomaly district, where it coexists with arsenopyrite and minor chalcopyrite and galena, in association with calcite, garnet, quartz, and fluorite (Fig. 6a, b, c). SpS is anhedral and exhibits heterogeneous red and honey colours. It is relatively translucent and lacks mineral inclusions. In some samples, SpS is replaced by pale-coloured sphalerite (Fig. 6c).\nSp1 represents sphalerite that was deposited in Stage 2 of the vein-type hydrothermal mineralization. It is intergrown with coarse grained galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, and arsenopyrite, together with quartz and rhodochrosite (Fig. 4d). Sp1 is normally euhedral, red in colour, coarse-grained (normally \uff1e 1\u00a0cm side length) with rare oscillatory zoning (Fig. 4d, 6d\u2013f). In the rim of Sp1, delicate alternating monomineralic bands of dark to pale sphalerite are developed (Fig. 6e, f).\nSp2 represents fine-grained (<200\u00a0\u03bcm), anhedral, red coloured, unzoned sphalerite (Fig. 6g, h) from Stage 3 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization, which is intergrown with fine-grained galena and silver-bearing sulfosalts (Fig. 4e, f). Sp2 is intergrown with fine-grained galena and sulfosalt minerals (Fig. 6g), or forms overgrowths on coarse grained galena (Fig. 6h).\n\n\n5.2\nGeochemistry of sphalerite\nTrace element compositions (LA-ICP-MS) of the three types of sphalerite are presented in Table 1\n with detailed results listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. A total of 84 LA-ICP-MS spot analyses were measured with data presented in box-and-whisker plots (Fig. 7\n) to provide an overview of medians, possible outliers, and variance of the element concentrations.\nThe trace elements Si, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Ga, Se, Mo, Ti, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, and Bi (n\u00a0=\u00a018) are above the detection limit of the LA-ICP-MS analysis. Among these, Ti, Mo, and Bi are only around 1\u00a0ppm and are not considered further. Although SpS has relatively high Co contents (3.77\u201322.90\u00a0ppm), other types of sphalerite have Co and Ni contents lower than 1\u00a0ppm. In summary, Si, Mn, Fe, Cu, As, Ga, Se, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, and Pb (n\u00a0=\u00a013) are enriched to varying extents in different types of sphalerite. Generally, Cd content is at the same order of magnitude (1000\u201310000\u00a0ppm) across all types of sphalerite, ranging from 1181\u20135139\u00a0ppm, with an average of 2060\u00a0ppm. Germanium is below detection limit, and Ga is low, ranging from 0.01\u20139.46\u00a0ppm, with an average of 2.27\u00a0ppm. In SpS, Se content ranges from 0.88 to 7.31\u00a0ppm, whereas Se contents are <3.40\u00a0ppm or below detection limit in other types of sphalerite.\nIn contrast to the other two types of sphalerite, SpS from skarns contains relatively high Fe (1745\u201374133\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a030194\u00a0ppm) and Mn (7.8\u20134009\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a01806\u00a0ppm) concentrations, but is deficient in most other trace elements (Fig. 7). Trace elements, including Cu, As, Ga, Ag, Sn, Sb, and Pb, have the lowest concentrations in SpS, with average contents lower than 1\u00a0ppm except for Cu which ranges from 8.5 to 38.8\u00a0ppm, with an average of 23.7\u00a0ppm. The concentrations of In range from 9.4 to 41.0\u00a0ppm, with an average of 26.6\u00a0ppm.\nIn contrast to SpS, Sp1 has relatively high As (average\u00a0=\u00a04.75\u00a0ppm), Ag contents (average\u00a0=\u00a036.8\u00a0ppm), Sb (average\u00a0=\u00a033.5\u00a0ppm), and Pb (average\u00a0=\u00a014.9\u00a0ppm) (Fig. 7). Sp1 has highly variable Cu and Sn concentrations ranging from 8.33 to 20614\u00a0ppm, and from 0.85 to 26737\u00a0ppm, respectively. Iron and Mn concentrations of Sp1 are similar to those of SpS (Table 1; Fig. 7). Some grains of Sp1 contain up to 2915\u00a0ppm In.\nSp2 contains the highest Ag (123\u20134893\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a01879\u00a0ppm), Pb (37.8\u20132975\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a01222\u00a0ppm), Sb (243\u201310429\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a04813\u00a0ppm), and As (2.87\u2013619\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a0179\u00a0ppm), but the lowest Fe (21.6\u2013234\u00a0ppm, avg.\u00a0=\u00a0106\u00a0ppm) and Mn (0.22\u20132.06, avg.\u00a0=\u00a00.63\u00a0ppm). Copper and Sn contents are similar to those of Sp1, whereas Ga and In are lower (Table 1; Fig. 7).\n\n\n5.3\nSulfur isotope results\nA total of 96 in-situ sulfur isotope analyses were performed on sulfide minerals in eight polished thin sections (Table 2\n). Sulfides analyzed include galena, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. Overall, these sulfides have \u03b434S compositions ranging from 1.4 \u2030 to 10.2 \u2030. Among these, \u03b434S ranges of sphalerite are 4.6 \u2030 to 10.2 \u2030, galena 1.4 \u2030 to 6.9 \u2030, arsenopyrite 4.4 \u2030 to 7.1\u2030, pyrite 6.3 \u2030 to 7.7\u2030, and chalcopyrite 4.0 \u2030 to 6.3\u2030.\nImportantly, sphalerite, galena, and arsenopyrite from different types of mineralization have contrasting \u03b434S values (Table 2). Arsenopyrite in skarns has \u03b434S of 4.4\u20136.0\u2030 (average 5.1\u2030), whereas arsenopyrite formed in Stage 1 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization has \u03b434S of 4.9\u20136.6\u2030 (average 5.3\u2030), and arsenopyrite formed in Stage 2 has \u03b434S of 6.1\u20137.1\u2030 (average 6.7\u2030). Sphalerite in skarns has \u03b434S of 4.6\u20136.3\u2030 (average 5.3\u2030), in contrast to sphalerite formed in Stage 2 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization with \u03b434S of 5.8\u201310.2\u2030 (average 7.6\u2030), and sphalerite in Stage 3 with \u03b434S of 7.5\u20139.1\u2030 (average 8.3\u2030). Stage 2 pyrite has \u03b434S values of 6.3\u2030 to 7.7\u2030 (average of 6.8\u2030), whereas \u03b434S of Stage 2 chalcopyrite is 4.0\u20136.3 \u2030.\nWhole-rock sulfur isotope analyses of crystalline limestone of the Ergunahe Formation indicate a range of \u03b434S from 12.3 to 14.8\u2030.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSubstitution and distribution of trace elements in Halasheng sphalerite\nThe mechanism of Ag incorporation in sphalerite has been studied by several authors. Cook et al. (2009) summarized previous studies and suggested that high concentrations of Ag are mostly related to Ag-mineral inclusions, and that sphalerite is not normally a major Ag-carrier. However, Cook et al. (2009) did provide an example of sphalerite with\u00a0>\u00a010,000\u00a0ppm Ag in solid solution from the Toyoha deposit in Japan. In the Halasheng deposit, Ag contents in sphalerite have a wide range. SpS has the lowest Ag concentrations (average\u00a0=\u00a00.96\u00a0ppm), and Sp1 and Sp2 have average Ag concentrations of 36.8\u00a0ppm and 1879\u00a0ppm, respectively. In all cases, the time-resolved depth profiles of Ag are smooth without sharp peaks (Fig. 8\n), thus indicating that most Ag in sphalerite is as Ag+ in solid solution (Cook et al., 2009), with a maximum of 4893\u00a0ppm Ag. LA-ICP-MS analyses reveal similar trends for As, Ag, Sb, and Pb (Fig. 7), with significant increases from skarns to Stage 2 and Stage 3 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization (Fig. 7; 11). LA mapping of Sp1 indicates that Ag has a similar enrichment pattern to those for As, Sb, and Pb, excluding the presence of significant numbers of Ag-Pb-As-Sb mineral inclusions (Fig. 10).\nArsenic and Sb have smooth depth profiles, indicating that most As and Sb are in isomorphic substitution in the sphalerite lattice, presumably as As3+ and Sb3+ (Fig. 8), the common valences of As and Sb. Discrete Pb minerals, including galena and falkmanite, are common inclusions in sphalerite, but there is also variable solid solution of Pb (as Pb2+) in sphalerite (Fig. 8e). The above four elements are probably incorporated into sphalerite in the form of 3Zn2+\u2194 (As3+, Sb3+)\u00a0+\u00a0Ag++Pb2+.\nManganese, Fe, and Cd are in solid solution in sphalerite. Figures 7, 9a, 10b, c, e, and 11d demonstrate that Mn and Fe have a strong positive correlation, whereas Fe has a negative correlation with Zn, consistent with Fe and Mn entering sphalerite lattices as Fe2+ and Mn2+ that replace Zn2+. There is no obvious relationship between Cd and Mn, Fe, or Zn, but most likely Cd2+, enters the sphalerite lattice via replacement of Zn2+, in the form of Zn2+\u2194Fe2+, Cd2+, Mn2+.\nIn Halasheng sphalerites, Cu and Sn exhibit smooth curves (Fig. 8) with subparallel trends (Figs. 8, 9\n) in the time-resolved depth profiles, suggesting that Cu+ and Sn4+ enter the sphalerite lattice via 3Zn2+\u2194 2Cu+ + Sn4+ (Cook et al., 2009; Cook et al., 2012; Belissont et al., 2016).\nIn Halasheng sphalerites, Ge is below detection limit, and Ga has a narrow low range (<10\u00a0ppm). Indium contents of sphalerite vary widely (Fig. 7). Selenium is concentrated in SpS (0.88\u20137.31\u00a0ppm) relative to Sp1 (0.66\u20133.40\u00a0ppm) and Sp2 (0.56\u20131.42\u00a0ppm). There are no obvious correlations between these elements, but their time-resolved profiles are smooth, indicating that most of them are in solid solution in sphalerite.\nAs tangential profiles in Fig. 9 demonstrate, some grains of Sp1 have formed from at least three pulses of hydrothermal fluid. In these sphalerites, the outermost layer is enriched in Pb, and to a lesser extent Ag and Sb (Fig. 9a), as a consequence of the presence of needle-like fine galena\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0falkmanite inclusions (Fig. 9c, d). The black veinlet that cuts the sphalerite is enriched in Cu, As, Ag, Sb, and Pb, suggesting the presence of galena, Ag-bearing tetrahedrite, and stromeyerite inclusions. Besides Ag-bearing sulfosalt mineral inclusions, Ag and Sb in Sp1 sphalerite have similar distribution patterns, being enriched in dark bands. In tangential profiles, Pb shows multiple sharp variations, suggesting the presence of Pb-bearing inclusions, probably galena. Generally, Fe and Mn contents are uniform but are somewhat higher in the darker bands. In Sp1 sphalerite, Sn and Cu contents are relatively consistent. In the second oscillatory zone, Sn and Cu contents vary and they are enriched in the dark third oscillatory zone (Fig. 9a, b).\nLA-ICP-MS element mapping was undertaken on Sp1 to visualize trace element distributions. Silver and Sb have compatible trends and their concentrations are largely independent of oscillatory zoning (Fig. 10\n i, j). Manganese, Fe, and Co have concordant variations, and are slightly enriched in dark bands (Fig. 10 a, b, c, d). Copper and Sn exhibit consistent variations with dark bands containing significantly higher contents than pale ones (Fig. 10 f, g).\n\n\n6.2\nPotential sources of ore-forming components\n\u03b434S values of sulfides from Ag-Pb-Zn veins at Halasheng range from 1.4 \u2030 to 10.2 \u2030. There are no recorded sulfate minerals from the Halasheng ores. Mineral assemblages with pyrite as the only major Fe-bearing phase in the ores suggest an intermediate oxygen fugacity (Hedenquist and Richards, 1998), and thus the \u03b434S values of pyrite (6.3\u20137.7\u2030) should broadly represent the \u03b434S value of the ore-forming hydrothermal fluids (Ohmoto, 1972). This value is within the range of \u03b434S values of magnetite-series granites (+1\u2013+9\u2030; Sasaki and Ishihara, 1979), consistent with the magnetite-bearing quartz monzonite in the Halasheng district. Sulfides in nearby hydrothermal ore deposits (Jiawula-Chaganbulagen Ag-Pb-Zn, Erentaologai Ag, Erdaohezi and Dongjun Pb-Zn-Ag deposits) generally yield \u03b434S values ranging from \u2013 4.0 \u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a08.4 \u2030 (Niu et al., 2017; Zhai et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Zhang, 2011; Tian, 2015; Zhao, 2017). Compared to these deposits, especially to the Jiawula-Chaganbulagen Ag-Pb-Zn ore field, which is within 70\u00a0km of Halasheng and shares similar host rocks, Halasheng sulfides have higher \u03b434S values. This may be related to fluid interaction with crystalline limestone which has high \u03b434S values of 12.3 to 14.8\u2030 in the Halasheng ore district.\nSulfur isotope compositions of sulfides can also reflect physico-chemical conditions including oxidation state and temperature (Ohmoto, 1972). At Halasheng there is a relative increase in \u03b434S values for sphalerite, galena, and arsenopyrite from skarns to vein-type hydrothermal mineralization (Fig. 12). There are several potential explanations for an increase of \u03b434S values during fluid evolution: (1) a decrease of pH and fO2 of the ore-forming fluids can cause 34S enrichment in later formed sulfides (Wilson et al., 2007; Cooke et al., 2011); (2) sulfide crystallization, especially galena, which tends to incorporate light sulfur (Kajiwara and Krouse, 1971), can decrease 32S contents of subsequent sulfides; and (3) decompression boiling can cause loss of gases including H2S, which enrich residual fluids in 32S, resulting in an increase in \u03b434S values of later sulfides. According to the mineral assemblages in different mineralization stages of the Halasheng ores (Figs. 4, 5), there is no obvious change in pH and oxidation state, so changes in these parameters can be excluded. Skarn mineralization and Stage 1 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization lack galena, and the \u03b434S values of sphalerite and arsenopyrite are relatively low. In Stage 2, there was widespread precipitation of galena which would have depleted the residual ore fluid in 32S, thus increasing the \u03b434S values of crystallizing sphalerite and arsenopyrite. Hence, galena crystallization is the most reasonable explanation for an increase of \u03b434S values of sphalerite and arsenopyrite.\n\n\n6.3\nImplications for ore genesis\nPrevious research on the Halasheng deposit, as summarized by Han et al. (2020) has suggested that the orebodies have a magmatic-hydrothermal affinity. Here, the new data presented in this paper are used to test this magmatic association. Clearly, the concealed skarns intersected in drill campaigns suggest this, but trace element concentrations of sphalerite can also be used to discriminate ore genetic associations (Zhang, 1987; Cook et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2011; Belissont et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2018). Generally, Ga, Ge, and Cd are considered to be enriched in low-temperature, high-salinity, and intrusion-unrelated systems, whereas In and Sn are regarded to be related to high-temperature, medium\u2013low-salinity, and intrusion-related deposits of magmatic affinity (Cook et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2011; Belissont et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2018). In order to decipher possible genesis type of Halasheng, and to verify whether this method is solid, trace element data of sphalerite from different types of deposits have been collected to provide a background for trace element compositions of Halasheng sphalerites. Fig. 11\n\n\n exhibits sphalerite trace element characteristics of four main types of Pb-Zn deposits, including epithermal, skarn, VMS, and MVT derived from Cook et al. (2009), Ye et al. (2011), Bauer et al. (2019), and Yu et al. (2020). For Halasheng sphalerite, Ge cannot be plotted as it is below the analytical detection limit. Fig. 11b and 11d demonstrate a relatively clear distinction between deposit types related to magmatism (epithermal, skarn, and VMS) and those that are unrelated (MVT), with the former enriched in In and Mn relative to the latter. Fig. 11c and e show that in contrast to MVT deposits, epithermal deposits have relatively high Cu, but low Cd contents. However, Fe, Cd, Sb, and Pb show no distinction between deposit types. In the plot of In vs Sn, sphalerite SpS from the skarn at Halasheng plots in the magmatic field whereas Sp1 and Sp2 from the vein-type mineralization are more dispersed (Fig. 11b). These data provide support for the geological and sulfur isotope evidence that the Halasheng deposit contains components of a magmatic system, albeit with sulfur contributed from the wall rocks based on average \u03b434SV-CDT values of 5.3\u2030, 7.6\u2030, and 8.3\u2030 for progressively more distal and younger generations of ore-related sulfides.\nThe dominant alteration types at Halasheng include illite-hydro-muscovite alteration, silicification, and Fe-Mn carbonate (mainly rhodochrosite) alteration. Together with the sulfide ore assemblage of galena-sphalerite-arsenopyrite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-tetrahedrite, the characteristics of the vein-type mineralization at Halasheng are typical of those recorded from intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposits (Wang et al., 2020; Einaudi et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2005). The textures of ore minerals that include oscillatory zoning plus late Ag enrichment involving sulfosalts and maximum Fe contents in sphalerite of 12.2%, within the range of sphalerite from intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits (0.05\u201315\u00a0mol%) (Wang et al., 2019a), all support the interpretation that Halasheng vein-type mineralization represents an intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit.\n\n\n6.4\nConstraints on evolution of ore-forming fluids\nThe occurrence of different types of sphalerite with various textures and trace element compositions and similar, but regularly increasing \u03b434S of sulfides indicate temporal evolution of the ore-forming fluids that formed the Halasheng deposit. Frenzel et al. (2016) summarized the relationship between trace element compositions of sphalerite and homogenization temperature, and concluded that concentrations of Mn, Fe, and In increase, whereas those of Ga and Ge decrease, in sphalerite with increasing temperature of deposition. On this basis, Frenzel et al. (2016) derived a sphalerite geothermometer (GGIMFis): T (\u00b0C) = \u2013 (54.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3) \u00b7 PC1* + (208\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010), PC1*=ln ((CGa\n0.22 \u00b7 CGe\n0.22)\/ (CFe\n0.37 \u00b7 CMn\n0.20 \u00b7 CIn\n0.11)). Since Ge concentrations of Halasheng sphalerite are below detection limits, Ge is assigned the detection limit of 0.03\u00a0ppm for application of this geothermometer to Halasheng. Results are presented below for different generations of sphalerite. Based on the assumption that Fe contents of sphalerite are buffered by pyrite, Frenzel et al. (2022) derive a series of equations to calculate sulfur fugacities:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nlog\n10\n\n\n\n\nFeS\n\n\nsp\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n0.80\n\u00b1\n0.02\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nlog\n10\n\n\n\n\n53.1\n\u00b7\nFeS\n\/\n\nFeS\nmax\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n1.38\n\u00b1\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nFeS\n\n\nmax\n\n\n=\n44.09\n+\n0.0125\n\u00b7\nT\n-\n3600\n\u00b7\np\n\/\nT\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\n10\n\n\nf\n\n\nS\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n-\n2\n\n\nlog\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nFeS\n\nsp\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n1.50\n\u00b1\n0.02\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n\/\nT\n+\n\n\n14.5\n\u00b1\n0.3\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nFeS is the Fe-content in sphalerite (mol.% FeS), and FeSmax is the temperature- and pressure-dependent maximum solubility of FeS in sphalerite where in contact with metallic Fe and troilite. T is temperature in Kelvin, and p is pressure in kbar (Barton and Toulmin, 1966; Scott and Barnes, 1971; Scott and Kissin, 1973; Balabin and Urusov, 1995; Lusk and Calder, 2004). Since in the Halasheng deposit, Sp1 is intergrown with pyrite, fS2 of this stage can be estimated using the equations of Frenzel et al. (2022). A formation pressure of 0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 kbar for epithermal deposits (Wang et al., 2019a; Hedenquist and Richards, 1998) and formation temperatures estimated from the GGIMFis geothermometer were utilized in the calculation.\nThe evolution of the Halasheng ore fluids is derived by combining data on textures, trace element contents, and sulfur isotope ratios of sphalerite, as constrained by geological environments and associated alteration and ore-related sulfide assemblages.\nDark red SpS occupies the interstices of garnet and calcite grains as a product of the quartz-sulfide stage of skarn mineralization (Fig. 6a, b, c, 15). It is characterized by a low concentration of most trace elements including Cu, As, Ag, Sn, Sb, and Pb but enrichment in Mn and Fe (Fig. 7), with In vs Sn relationships typical of a magmatic association (Fig. 11 b, d). The GGIMFis geothermometer indicates temperatures of deposition of 306\u2013413\u00a0\u00b0C, which is in accordance with the fluid inclusion homogenization temperature of SpS (314\u2013398\u00a0\u00b0C, our unpublished data). \u03b434S of SpS of 5.3 \u2030 are consistent with a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for the sphalerite. Thus, all data are consistent with a model in which Early Cretaceous granites intruded into the Middle Jurassic andesite and overlying Late Jurassic rhyolitic tuff and enclosed crystalline limestone, resulting in localized Zn-Pb-Cu skarn mineralization (Fig. 15).\nEuhedral, coarse-grained Sp1 formed in Stage 2 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization, precipitating together with sulfide (galena, chalcopyrite) and sulfosalt minerals (tetrahedrite, and bournonite) (Fig. 15). Temperatures of deposition of Sp1 calculated from the GGIMFis geothermometer are 308\u2013385\u00a0\u00b0C, while fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of Sp1 are 220\u2013283\u00a0\u00b0C (our unpublished data). The GGIMFis temperature of Sp1 is higher than the fluid inclusion temperature of Sp1, perhaps due to extreme variations in trace element contents in even single Sp1 grains. Sulfur fugacities calculated from equations (1) \u223c (3) above are displayed in a sulfur fugacity-inverse temperature plot (Fig. 14\n\n). Sp1 plots in the intermediate sulfidation field (Fig. 14), which is consistent with the mineral assemblage (galena-sphalerite-pyrite-chalcopyrite) of this mineralization stage. Oscillatory zoning is common in Sp1 (Fig. 6d\u2013f). Such oscillatory zoning in sulfides has been attributed to several mechanisms:1) an internal factor related to element distributions on the interface of fluids and minerals combined with growth kinetics factors (Fowler and L\u2019Heureux, 1996; Di Benedetto et al., 2005; Barker and Cox 2011), although these may be minor effects (Fougerouse et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018); 2) changes in chemical compositions of ore-forming fluids, including changes related to fluid-wall rock reactions (Scott, 1973; Cook et al., 2009; Gagnevin et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2021); and 3) changes in the physical environment including variations in temperature, pressure, pH, oxygen fugacity, and\/or sulfur fugacity (Pattrick et al., 1993; Pfaff et al., 2010, 2011; Barker et al., 2009; Peterson and Mavrogenes, 2014; Li et al., 2018). Significant variation in Zn concentration within oscillatory zoned Sp1 (Table 1) suggests that internal factors are less important. There are no obvious changes in temperature, pH, oxygen fugacity, and\/or sulfur fugacity to suggest unstable physical conditions. The second factor is favored for the genesis of oscillatory zoning texture of Sp1. Accordingly, it is interpreted that following intrusion emplacement, magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, that were advected into N-S-trending extensional faults to form the ores, interacted with wallrocks to modify fluid conditions and deposit Sp1 enriched in trace elements relative to SpS (Fig. 7). This process can also explain the oscillatory zonation textures of Sp1 as well as cause significant variation in \u03b434S of sulfides (Fig. 13).\nSp2 was deposited in Stage 3 of vein-type hydrothermal mineralization where it replaced Spl or was part of quartz-sulfide-sulfosalt veinlets that crosscut Stage 2 ores (Fig. 4e, f, 15). Anhedral, fine grained, Mn-Fe-depleted, light yellow Sp2, associated with needle-like falkmanite, galena, and silver-bearing sulfosalt minerals (Fig. 6g, h), has average contents of As, Ag, Sb, and, Pb two orders of magnitude higher than those of Sp1 (Fig. 7). The average \u03b434S of Sp2 is 8.3\u2030, which is higher than the average value of Sp1, but within its range (Fig. 12), is interpreted to result from previous extensive deposition of galena. Significant differences exist between trace element contents of Sp2 and Sp1. Iron and Mn contents of Sp2 are two-order of magnitude lower than those of Sp1 and SpS (Fig. 7). The GGIMFis geothermometer suggests depositional temperatures of Sp2 of 119\u2013227.1\u00a0\u00b0C (Frenzel et al., 2016), roughly in accord with fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of Sp2 of 145\u2013232\u00a0\u00b0C (our unpublished data), and significantly lower than those of SpS in the skarns.\nIt is thus apparent that the latest lower temperature ore-forming fluids were enriched in Ag, and that Ag-bearing sulfosalt minerals and Ag-rich sphalerite precipitated later than the more extensive galena and sphalerite. Although it is suggested by some authors (Wilkinson et al., 2013) that salinity may be the controlling factor in Ag enrichment, our unpublished fluid inclusion data indicate that they are essentially indistinguishable at 16.3\u201317.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. in SpS, Sp1, and Sp2.\n\n\n6.5\nPotential exploration significance\nThe recognition of both high-T skarns and lower-T intermediate sulfidation epithermal vein-type mineralization is suggestive of a zoned mineral system at Halasheng. Porphyry-skarn-epithermal systems are the classic example of such a system containing intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposits at highest crustal levels in the systems (Fig. 16\n; Sillitoe, 2010). Several lines of evidence suggest the potential for a porphyry Cu-Au system at depth. There are commonly porphyry-rich belts of different age within the same regional arc system, as for example in the Andes where there are adjacent Middle Eocene-Early Oligocene and Miocene-Early Pliocene Cu-Au porphyry-skarn belts (Sillitoe and Perello, 2005). In the southern part of the Erguna Block (EB), in the Eastern Domain of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt which hosts Halasheng, there are a series of Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic porphyry Cu and Cu-Mo deposits that range in age from 234 to 180\u00a0Ma (Fig. 1). It would be expected that these would be more deeply eroded than the younger belt of Lower Cretaceous Pb-Zn and Pb-Zn-Ag deposits that include Halasheng (Fig. 1; Qin et al., 2021) where the ore bodies are largely concealed, providing potential for discovery of the porphyry Cu-Au roots of a porphyry-related system at depth, particularly as there are granite porphyry intrusions in the district (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe Halasheng deposit comprises both concealed skarn and vein-type Ag-Pb-Zn orebodies. LA-ICP-MS trace-element analyses demonstrate that Mn Fe, Cu, As, Ga, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, and Pb are variably enriched in different generations of sphalerite from the Halasheng Ag-Pb-Zn deposit. Three generations of sphalerite, SpS from the skarns and Sp1 and Sp2 from Stages 2 and 3 of vein-type mineralization contain average Ag values of 0.96\u00a0ppm, 36.8\u00a0ppm, and 1879\u00a0ppm, respectively. Substitution of Ag+ in the sphalerite lattice is via 3Zn2+\u2194 (As3+, Sb3+)\u00a0+\u00a0Ag++Pb2+. Native silver and discrete Ag-bearing minerals mainly occur in Stage 3 of the vein-type mineralization as part of an enrichment of Ag in late ore fluids within the mineralizing system. In-situ sulfur isotope analyses of the ores give average \u03b434SV-CDT values of 5.3\u2030, 7.6\u2030, and 8.3\u2030 for progressively more distal and younger generations of sphalerite. Given the intermediate oxidation state of the ore from mineral assemblages, these sulfur isotope ratios are within the range expected for involvement of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids with progressive increase in \u03b434S related to reaction with wall rocks with heavier sulfur: crystalline limestone with \u03b434S of from 12.3 to 14.8\u2030. The trace-element and isotope research help confirm the magmatic connection of the Halasheng Ag-Pb-Zn deposit suggested by other data. As such, it is possible that the concealed Lower Cretaceous Pb-Zn skarns and intermediate sulfidation Pb-Zn-Ag epithermal deposits are part of a larger porphyry-related mineral system with porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposits, similar to those of Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic age in the same metallogenic belt, at deeper crustal levels at Halasheng.\n\n","29":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nBanded iron formation (BIF) hosted high-grade iron ore is mostly a monomineralic rock, consisting of various types of iron oxides with very low modal contributions of gangue quartz, carbonate, silicate, and phosphate (Hagemann et al., 2016, and references therein). The present contribution aims to better understand the highly debated transformation of magnetite-quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0hematite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-silicates BIF (with \u223c20\u201340\u00a0wt% Fe) to hematite iron ore (up to 69\u00a0wt%), by focussing on the textural and chemical characteristics and inter-relationships of iron oxides from various alteration zones within iron ore systems. We sampled the famous Mt. Tom Price and Mt. Whaleback deposits in the Western Australian Hamersley Province (Angerer et al., 2017; Thorne et al., 2017): hematite ore in spatial relation with structures controlling ore fluid flow and hydrothermally altered BIF from within the deposits, as well as distal least-altered BIF. A chemical alteration model in the context of structurally controlled ore formation is presented and discussed with respect to existing genetic models.\n\n1.1\nThe Hamersley Province hematite ore controversy\nThe genesis of Paleoproterozoic high-grade martite-microplaty ore (in short hematite ore) deposits in the Hamersley Province (Fig. 1\n) remains a matter of debate. Since the late 1990s, delineation of complex hydrothermal alteration in unweathered BIF and country rocks proximal to deep seated hematite ore and advances in fluid characterisation have led to development of a series of hydrothermal models (Barley et al., 1999; Evans et al., 2013; Hagemann et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2004; Thorne et al., 2014). In general terms, these models include polyphase ore formation by structurally controlled infiltration of basinal brines and\/or heated meteoric water and Fe-upgrade by hydrothermal carbonate\u2013silicate leaching and (coeval or subsequent) hematite mineralisation. Supergene weathering conditions refined ore by further gangue dissolution and goethite precipitation (Clout, 2005; Ramanaidou and Morris, 2009; Thorne et al., 2008). An alternative model for microplaty hematite ore formation in combination with hydrothermal chert dissolution invoked non-classical crystallisation by coalescence of colloidal hematite (Egglseder et al., 2019). Most studies from the Hamersley Province were conducted in the central part of the Province, at Mt. Tom Price and Paraburdoo. The eastern part of the Hamersley province remains less well investigated, despite hosting a wealth of resources in hematite and martite-goethite deposits. Mt. Whaleback is the largest, most structurally complex, and deepest-seated of all known orebodies in the region, yet comprehensive data bases from the orebody itself are scarce (Powell et al., 1999; Webb et al., 2004). Hydrothermal ore forming models have been proposed for several BIF-hosted hematite ore districts worldwide (Hagemann et al., 2016), however, these models are not generally accepted for the Hamersley Province (Morris and Kneeshaw, 2011). The main competing concept is the supergene-metamorphic model (Morris, 1985; Morris and Fletcher, 1987) which postulates that goethite, formed in an ancient supergene martite-goethite ore, dehydrated at very low burial temperatures (\u223c80\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C) to produce microplaty hematite ore.\n\n\n1.2\nRecent advances in iron oxide chemistry studies related to ore genesis\nThe principle mechanisms for trace element partitioning between hydrothermal fluids and iron oxide crystal lattices is solid solution, which adheres to dynamic equilibrium reactions such as.\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\nO\n+\n\nFe\n2\n\n3\n+\n\n\n\nO\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nmagnetite\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\naq\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\nO\n+\n\n\nMe\n\n\n3\n+\n\n\n\n\nFe\n\n\n3\n+\n\n\n\nO\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nss\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\nFe\n\n\n3\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\naq\n\n\n\n\nwith Me\u00a0=\u00a0metal ion, ss\u00a0=\u00a0solid solution in magnetite. Similar reactions existing for other iron oxides. More complex reactions, involving coupled substitution of variably charged elements or formation of vacancies, are also possible. Besides crystallographic charge and radius control, numerous physico-chemical parameters influence element partition coefficients: salinity and metal composition of the fluid, pressure, temperature, pH, eH, fO2\n and fS2\n (Nadoll et al., 2014). These dependencies are the reason that trace element chemistry of iron oxides is the focus of research in petrology, ore genesis, and mineral exploration. However, The quantitative effects of the system variables on partition coefficients for natural iron oxides are not well established (Nadoll et al., 2017). There are very limited datasets of partition coefficients for representative hydrothermal fluids (Ilton and Eugster, 1989) and metasediments (Nadoll et al., 2017), or of chemical re-equilibration (Canil and Lacourse, 2020; Hu et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2017). Processes that complicate the determination of partitioning, and thus the interpretation of chemistry, are disequilibrium precipitation, chemical inheritance from replacement reactions, surface sorption reactions (the dominant process in low temperature environment and small crystal sizes), trace elements distribution into exsolution and in foreign inclusions, and solid-state re-equilibration by diffusion or coupled dissolution-reprecipitation.\nMost studies on iron oxide chemistry have dealt with processes in magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal magnetite (Broughm et al., 2017; Dare et al., 2015; Dare et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2018; Makvandi et al., 2016; Milani et al., 2016; Nadoll et al., 2015; Pisiak et al., 2017; Salazar et al., 2019; Sievwright et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019) and hematite (Ciobanu et al., 2015; Duuring et al., 2020; Gomes et al., 2018; Hensler et al., 2015; Verdugo-Ihl et al., 2017). Iron oxide chemistry in low to medium temperature hydrothermal and metamorphic systems is less well studied. Only a few works investigate oxide chemistry in BIF and related iron ore (Angerer et al., 2011; Angerer et al., 2013b; Chung et al., 2015; Duuring et al., 2020; Gomes et al., 2018; Hensler et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2018; Huberty et al., 2012; Keyser et al., 2018). These studies show that iron oxides in BIF and related iron ore reveal systematic patterns of abundances and ratios of a series of cations compatible in iron oxides: Al, As, Cu, Co, Cr, Ga, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sn, Ti, V, W, and Zn. To develop robust models for trace metal dependencies, we need more data from metal-depleted low-temperature hydrothermal systems. The present study on two major BIF-related iron ore deposits of Western Australia aims to address this issue.\n\n\n1.3\nThe geology of the Hamersley Province\nThe Hamersley Province (Fig. 1a) is a folded, low-grade metamorphosed, basin which mainly comprises the 2,500\u00a0m thick Mt Bruce Supergroup, a sequence of Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic carbonates, volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and BIFs, resting on an Archean granite-greenstone domain (Harmsworth et al., 1990; Trendall and Blockley, 1970). During the deposition of the Hamersley Group, including all BIF, the region was a passive continental margin (Martin and Morris, 2010; Tyler, 1991). The 2600\u20132480\u00a0Ma Brockman iron formation (IF) consists of four members; Dales Gorge BIF, Whaleback Shale, Joffre BIF and Yandicoogina shale (Fig. 1b). The Dales Gorge Member hosts the majority of hematite mineralisation. This member is a laterally extensive series of 17 BIF and 16 shale \u201cmacrobands\u201d and varies in thickness from 108 to 185\u00a0m (Harmsworth et al., 1990; Trendall and Blockley, 1970).\nThe Ophthalmia (D2: ca. 2.2\u20132.1\u00a0Ga), Panhandle (D3: 2031\u20132008\u00a0Ma), and Ashburton\/Capricorn (D4: ca. 1770\u00a0Ma) orogenies had the strongest impact on outcrop patterns (see review in Morris and Kneeshaw, 2011). The Ophthalmian fold and thrust belt is defined by E-W trending folds and terminal steep normal faults (Lipple, 1995). Low-grade peak metamorphism of BIF is recorded, with deformation and metamorphism intensity generally increasing (from prehnite-pumpellyite zone; prehnite-pumpellyite-epidote zone; prehnite-pumpellyite-epidote-actinolite zone; to (prehnite)-epidote-actinolite zone) towards the southern part of the Province (Smith et al., 1982). Post-metamorphic D3 and D4 events caused significant folding and faulting throughout the region, with local coaxiality to D2. A northwest-trending dolerite dike set, prominently observed in various ore deposits, has been dated in one locally at 2209\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0Ma (Martin and Morris, 2010).\n\n\n1.4\nThe major hematite deposits Mt. Tom Price and Mt. Whaleback\nIt is exclusively in the southern Ophthalmia Range that numerous large to giant hematite deposits are located. The importance of extensional D2-faults, which are locally rotated, to the spatial distribution of several BIF-hosted hematite orebodies has been established (Lipple, 1995; Powell et al., 1999; Rasmussen et al., 2007b; Taylor et al., 2001; Tyler, 1991), while a region-wide validity of this structural control is disputed (Morris and Kneeshaw, 2011).\nThe Mt. Tom Price hematite deposit represents a south-dipping tabular body within the eastern fold closure of the Turner syncline (Fig. 1c). The deposit contained an original resource of 900 Mt at 63.9\u00a0wt% Fe and\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u00a0wt% P (Thorne et al., 2017). High-Fe, low P, martite-microplaty hematite ore extends for 7\u00a0km from the North orebody in the north-west to the South East Prong orebody in the south-east (Fig. 2\na). The tabular orebodies are up to 1.6\u00a0km wide with a maximum depth (limited by the stratigraphic footwall) of 250\u00a0m below the pre-mining topographic surface, which roughly coincides with depth of weathering (Taylor et al., 2001). The majority of ore is hosted within the Dales Gorge Member, with lower-grades occurring in the lower Whaleback Shale and Joffre Members and the upper Mount McRae Shale (Fig. 2b). Fluid flow forming epigenetic replacement ore in BIF were controlled by large (D2) normal fault systems, i.e., the Southern Batter Fault and SE Prong fault. Those faults have been partially reactivated during D4 (Taylor et al., 2001). Locally, three hydrothermal alteration zones have been recognised in BIF below the weathering front (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2004; Thorne et al., 2008): distal magnetite-siderite-stilpnomelane, intermediate hematite-magnetite-ankerite-chlorite and proximal martite-microplaty hematite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0magnetite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0apatite. These alteration zones laterally grade into each other or unaltered BIF. In places, alteration zones end at aquitards, such as shales and dolerite dikes that all pre-date ore (Martin et al., 1998; Martin and Morris, 2010; Taylor et al., 2001), or are truncated at reactivated faults (Fig. 2b). Based on this alteration zonation, recent ore deposit models invoke a multi-stage hydrothermal genesis for the high-grade hematite Mt. Tom Price deposit, followed by supergene weathering-related modification (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2004; Thorne et al., 2008): Stage 1a formed the distal alteration, while stage 1b formed the intermediate alteration. Both show a moderate Fe enrichment to\u00a0<\u00a055\u00a0wt% Fe (Thorne et al., 2008). Stage 2 (55\u201368\u00a0wt% Fe) resulted in the hydrothermal hematite ore, while the ore in the weathering zone was modified during stage 3, which mainly includes precipitation of goethite in pores and replacing gangue, and further gangue leaching (Clout, 2005; Ramanaidou and Morris, 2009; Thorne et al., 2008).\nNumerous hematite orebodies are aligned along the southern Ophthalmia Range in the eastern Hamersley Region (Fig. 1d). By far the largest orebody, with an initial resource of \u223c1.8 Gt high-grade ore, is Mt. Whaleback, which is located in a faulted outlier of Hamersley Group rocks in the south-eastern Hamersley Province. In this orebody, high-grade hematite ore is predominantly hosted within the Dales Gorge Member BIF (Fig. 3\n). The orebody is spatially associated with two low-angle fault systems (late D2), namely the Central Fault and East Footwall Fault systems. Those structures are block rotated extensional faults, dip very gently to the south-southwest, and display several hundred meters of stratigraphic displacement (Ronaszeki, 2010). The Central Fault system has been interpreted as the main structure controlling ore-forming fluid flow (Dalstra and Rosi\u00e8re, 2008; Powell et al., 1999). The BIF to ore contacts cut through early F2 folds in the orebody, suggesting that mineralisation post-dated folding (Taylor et al., 2001). The discrete northern boundary of the deposit is marked by the Whaleback Fault, which is an D4 Ashburton\/Capricorn orogeny structure (Tyler, 1991; Tyler and Thorne, 1990; Tyler and Thorne, 1994). Here, rocks of the Fortescue Formation are juxtaposed against the orebody. The Whaleback Fault has been interpreted to be a post-ore structure, mainly based on the observation that mineralised BIF and ore is juxtaposed against largely fresh country rocks (Powell et al., 1999). While hydrothermal carbonate alteration was discovered in McRae shale below the Mt. Whaleback orebody (Webb et al., 2004), no hydrothermal alteration zones has been discovered in the BIF itself, as yet. Therefore, the sole petrographically mappable BIF alteration features are the degree of oxidation (jaspilitic chert alteration and martitisation) and hematite mineralisation.\n\n\n\n2\nMethods\n\n2.1\nSampling and petrography\nSeveral diamond drillholes from Mt. Tom Price that intersect the Southern Batter Fault have been sampled (Fig. 2b) as well as two drillholes (STR002, STR17) located closer to SE Prong Fault. At Mt. Whaleback, drillhole D302 (Fig. 4\na) intersects a Central Fault splay, drillhole D0373 (Fig. 4b) an East Footwall Fault splay, while drillhole D370 intersects a fault system with the upper two to three faults identified as Whaleback Fault splays (Fig. 4c). Sampled satellite deposits include the Hashimoto-H1 (drill cores HH554 and HH555), Homestead (outcrop), and Mt. Helen prospect (outcrop). Fresh (least-altered) BIF has been sampled from the outer parts of Mt. Tom Price deposit and from drill core EC0661D, which has been recovered \u223c0.5\u00a0km south of Eastern Ridge-OB25 (Fig. 1d). Sampled hematite ore from Mt. Tom Price are from zones below the weathering front. At Mt. Whaleback, ore may partly be affected by progressed wreathing-related gangue leaching, but is devoid of goethite precipitation or ferricrete formation. Because hematite is stable in weathering conditions, we assume that microplaty hematite chemistry has not been modified by weathering and cold groundwater interaction.\nPolished thin sections (BIF) and 1\u00a0in. mounts (ore) have been prepared at University of Western Australia for optical and SEM petrography. Forty samples of those have been selected for chemical microanalyses.\n\n\n2.2\nElectron microprobe mapping and laser ablation ICP-MS analyses\nChemical X-ray mapping with a wavelength dispersive electron probe microanalyser (JEOL Superprobe 8100 at Innsbruck University, Austria) was utilised to investigate details of oxide growth and nature of solid inclusion in oxides. A x-y-stage-move mapping mode of carbon-coated samples was employed, with an acceleration voltage of 15\u00a0kV and a probe current of 5nA. Spot dwell times were set between 125 and 900\u00a0ms, largely depending on map size and resolution. Following analysing crystals were used: LIFH for Fe k\u03b1, Mn k\u03b1, TAP for Mg k\u03b1, Al k\u03b1, and Si k\u03b1, PETJ for Ca k\u03b1, P k\u03b1, and Ti k\u03b1.\nLaser ablation analyses on magnetite and hematite types were carried out in three labs (UQAC Chicoutimi, Curtin University Perth, UTAS Hobart). Details on the analytical set-ups, data reduction, and quality control are provided in Appendix 1.\n\n\n\n3\nHypogene alteration zones in BIF\nIn this section, metamorphism and hypogene alteration zones in Mt. Whaleback and Mt. Tom Price ore deposits are briefly described, with additional details listed in Table 1\n. The sample set (Table 2\n) represents all alteration zones.\n\n3.1\nLeast-altered BIF\nDrill core EC0661D at Eastern Ridge reveals a rare occurrence of fresh BIF. Least-altered and a hydrothermally altered BIF distal to ore have been sampled from this core (see Appendix 1 for core log and sample position).\nLeast-altered, metamorphosed BIF comprises layers of magnetite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0hematite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz intercalated with layers of quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-silicate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0magnetite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0hematite (Fig. 5\na, b). In micro-folded zones, magnetite layers are broken and quartz recrystallise in comb textures (Fig. 6\na). Shear-deformed BIF are rich in anhedral and nano-scale hematite (Fig. 5c). Subordinate Fe-silicates include greenalite, stilpnomelane, and minnesotaite, Fe-carbonate include siderite and members of the ankerite-dolomite series (Fig. 6b). Silicates amd carbonates are largely absent in hematite-rich BIF, resulting from hematite having replaced carbonates and silicates (Fig. 6c).\nUnaltered shale macrobands interlayerd with BIF are typically green, grey, or black, and contain variable amounts of sheet silicates, carbonates, quartz and accessories (Trendall and Blockley, 1970).\n\n\n3.2\nDistal and intermediate hydrothermal BIF alteration zones\nAt Mt. Tom Price, hydrothermal BIF alteration zones with distal magnetite-siderite-stilpnomelane\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite (Fig. 6d) and intermediate hematite-magnetite-ankerite-chlorite (Fig. 6e) assemblages are locally preserved surrounding proximal hematite-apatite ore below the weathering front at \u223c250\u00a0m depth below surface (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2009; Thorne et al., 2004). The BIF layering in the distal and intermediate alteration zones originate from those in fresh BIF, while the strikingly reduced modal fraction of quartz in the two alteration zones is attributed to replacement. Thorne et al. (2004) provided petrographic evidence from Mt. Tom Price North deposit that the distal zone assemblage is partially replaced by the intermediate zone assemblage. Both assemblages have been interpreted as post-metamorphic and pre-ore alteration zones (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2004).\nAt Eastern Ridge, local Fe-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Fe-silicate assemblages are evidence of post-metamorphic hydrothermal alteration. Two hydrothermal assemblages are observed: a magnetite-siderite-Fe-dolomite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0stilpnomelane\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite (Fig. 5d) and a hematite-Fe-dolomite-chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0apatite type (Fig. 5e). Veins and pervasive alteration crosscut metamorphic recrystallised quartz layers and syn-deformational comb quartz (Fig. 6f). It appears that the hematite-rich overprinted the magnetite-rich assemblage. Only the magnetite-dominated alteration has been sampled, while the hematite-dominated was not due to the small hematite grain size.\n\n\n3.3\nProximal hematite-altered BIF and hematite ore\nReddish coloured jaspilitic BIF is the most common BIF type encountered in and around orebodies (10\u00a0s to 100\u00a0s\u00a0m away from ore) (Fig. 5f). Close to ore, veinlets and patches of microplaty hematite are present in such BIF. This characteristic occurrence of microplaty hematite, representing a subordinate mineralisation feature, permits proximal jaspilitic BIF to be distinguished from other jaspilitic BIF common in metamorphic deformation and weathered zones.\nHigh-grade ore after BIF is commonly laminated, mimicking the pre-existing BIF layering, or locally brecciated (Fig. 5g). The rocks are composed almost entirely of microplay, martite, and anhedral hematite (see section 4). Ore in exterior zones of the deposit is indistinguishable from that in the centre of the orebody close to structures that controlled mineralising fluid flow. Within fault zones (at Mt. Whaleback the Central and Whaleback Faults, at Mt. Tom the Price Southern Batter and Eastern Prong Faults), ore and hematite-altered BIF are typically brecciated or cataclastic deformed (Fig. 5h). At Central Fault, cataclasites are rich in microplaty hematite-apatite veinlets, while at Whaleback Fault, cataclasites show pyrite-magnetite clasts within ore-forming hematite (Angerer et al., 2013a).\nShale layers within ore are present as reddish layers of clay and cryptocrystalline hematite (20\u201340\u00a0wt% Fe). Their thickness is typically much thinner, 1\/2 or 1\/3 of least-altered shale layers. These rocks are affected by alteration during hematite ore formation; in and proximal to the Central Fault, shales are transformed into microplaty hematite ore (e.g., in D302: Fig. 5i).\n\n\n\n4\nIron oxide petrography and a paragenetic sequence\nBased on our observations, a descriptive paragenetic sequence for oxides involved in the BIF to high-grade hematite ore transformation is established (Fig. 7\na). The sequence is valid for Mt. Whaleback and Mt. Tom Price, while some alteration stages are preserved only at Mt. Tom Price. In a flow chart diagram (Fig. 7b) all important textural oxide (trans-) formation stages (with acronyms for easy distinction) are shown. Table 3\n lists related oxide-forming chemical reactions.\n\n4.1\nDiagenetic nano-scale and anhedral hematite\nEarly hematite forms aggregates and layers of fused anhedral, stubby microplaty, and poikiloblastic globular shapes; all of these are overprinted by metamorphic magnetite (Ayres, 1972; LaBerge, 1973; Trendall and Blockley, 1970). Anhedral hematite cores within magnetite in oxide layers have been interpreted by Ayres (1972) and Ewers and Morris (1981) as remnants of early hematite. Early hematite in gangue layers of least-altered BIF are clay-sized, \u201cdusty\u201d hematite (c.f., Beukes and Gutzmer, 2008) inclusions in metachert. The anhedral-globular types are mostly likely concretions of earlier dusty hematite. The formation of early ferric oxides (dusty type H-0a, anhedral\/globular type H-0b) is depicted in Fig. 7 as process A, with the related chemical reaction being a dehydration of ferrihydrates (Table 3). These diagenetic (to earliest metamorphic) hematite generations are unrelated to ore-forming hematite (Morris, 2012), and are not further discussed.\n\n\n4.2\nMetamorphic magnetite and hematite\nMetamorphic magnetite appears as euhedral\/subhedral crystals and amalgamated anhedral grains forming micro- to mesoscale banding with alternating gangue layers. Metamorphic magnetite is non-porous with local solid inclusions of quartz, silicates, carbonate, or apatite. The magnetite is commonly zoned (Ayres, 1972; Morris, 1980; Trendall and Blockley, 1970), with xenomorphic cores, locally overprinting diagenetic hematite (H-0a, H-0b), and euhedral rims. The EPMA maps in the Appendix 1 show examples of magnetite zoning. Metamorphic magnetite (M-0) formation is represented by process B in the paragenetic sequence (Fig. 7), and may either be related to hematite reduction in presence of organic matter (process B1) (Posth et al., 2013) or by siderite breakdown in the presence of heated formation water (process B2), as proposed by Rasmussen and Muhling (2018) (Table 3).\nIn sheared BIF, deformation-controlled anhedral and lepidoblastic hematite (H-0c) post-dates metamorphic magnetite M-0. Hematite in shear zones most likely formed by magnetite and silicate oxidation and deformation-controlled coupled dissolution-reprecipitation (process C, Table 3). This hematite generation is unrelated to ore-forming hematite (Morris, 2012), and not discussed further.\n\n\n4.3\nMagnetite in hydrothermally altered BIF\nThere is a modest textural distinction between magnetite in fresh BIF and in hydrothermally altered BIF of stage 1a and 1b: Porosity is commonly higher in hydrothermally altered BIF at Eastern Ridge and at Mt. Tom Price (Fig. 6e), as described in Thorne et al. (2004). Inclusions and fractures are typically filled with alteration-related phases dolomite, siderite, silicates, or apatite. This suggests that characteristic porosity in this magnetite generation (M-1a and M-1b, referring to stages 1a and 1b) is a result of a metasomatic modification, probably a dissolution-reprecipitation reaction (Table 3), which is depicted as processes D and E (Fig. 7). Locally, bladed magnetite occurs in hydrothermally altered BIF of the distal zone, suggesting that magnetite also grew pseudomorphic after pre-existing hematite, dolomite, or siderite (Thorne et al., 2004).\n\n\n4.4\nPseudomorphous hematite after magnetite (martite)\nEquidimensional, subhedral, triangular, cubic or octahedral shaped hematite grains all represent martite (i.e, hematite after magnetite). Magnetite relics are in places preserved within martite grains (Fig. 8\na), but may also be dissolved leaving voids (Fig. 8b, c). Relics of metastable iron-deficient kenomagnetite or maghemite (Davis et al., 1968; Morris, 1980) have not been identified by petrography. The common skeletal (crisscross) hematite textures are laths after\u00a0\u3008111\u3009\u00a0crystallographic orientation of magnetite (Fig. 8c). Mosaic textured martite (Morris, 1980) is a peculiar texture made from irregularly shaped 10\u2013100\u00a0s\u00a0\u00b5m crystallites. There is evidence of martitisation in all oxidised zones. Martite is a minor component in sheared metamorphic BIF (maH-0 by process C) and hydrothermally altered BIF (maH-1b by process F), and overwhelmingly abundant in hematite ore (maH-2 by process G).\nIt remains uncertain from petrography, whether martitisation reactions in BIF and iron ore are pseudomorphous CDR process via reaction with O2 (Morris, 1985; M\u00fccke and Cabral, 2005) or removal of Fe2+ (Ohmoto, 2003; Otake et al., 2007; Otake et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2018); both reactions are shown in Table 3. Occasionally, skeletal martites are preserved as relics in a zone of mosaic textured hematite, indicating that martitisation is locally a complex, probably polyphase, transformation process in iron ore.\n\n\n4.5\nMicroplaty hematite in hydrothermally altered BIF and ore\nThe morphology, size, and textures of microplaty hematite in ore and associated BIF are variable. Most common shapes are plates 10 to 500\u00a0\u00b5m in length (in cross sections sheaths with up to 10:1 length to width ratios) (Fig. 8c, d, e).\nIn the stage 1b hematite-magnetite-ankerite-chlorite BIF assemblage at Mt. Tom Price, hematite often overprints magnetite (Fig. 6e), while, at some stage, coeval precipitation of hematite (H-1b) and magnetite (M-1b) cannot be ruled out. Solid inclusions in stage 1b microplaty hematite reflect prevailing or replaced gangue phases, such as stage 1a stilpnomelane. The ankerite\u00a0+\u00a0hematite forming reaction is most likely a siderite oxidation while required Ca and Mg were added by the fluid (Table 3).\nIn all hematite ore, a high degree of porosity between randomly oriented interlocked sheaths is common, while a preferred oriented fabric is absent (Fig. 8d). Here, microplaty hematite (generation mpH-2) often nucleates on martite grains and on the edges of iron oxide layers (Fig. 8f). This growth mode is epitaxial and the composition of microplaty hematite reveals rhythmic Al-Si zoning in the crystallographic c-axis (Fig. 9\na). Internally, mpH-2 can show complex growth zones with cores with distinct textures. Cores are often identified as chert-inclusion-rich hematite (Fig. 8e), resembling early H-0b globular types (Ayres, 1972; LaBerge, 1973; Trendall and Blockley, 1970), or as fibrous shapes, which may resemble relics of hematite-replaced silicates (Fig. 6c). Globular hematite cores within microplaty hematite show higher and variable Si-Al content (Fig. 9b), while Si-, and partly Al-enriched cores are evidence of hematite replacing Fe-silicates. Microplaty hematite are characterised by chemical zoning of, at least, Fe, Si and Al (Fig. 9c). This supports a protracted growth, likely precipitated from an aqueous solution. Leached cores are commonly observed within martite (maH-2, see above), and in ore they are partially filled with microplaty hematite (Fig. 8g) and in hematite-altered BIF with red dusty hematite (Fig. 8c).\nTextures suggest the following sequence for hematite formation: (1) partial replacement of magnetite (i.e., typically the rims) to martite (processes G), (2) dissolution of remaining magnetite cores, Fe-silicates, and Fe-carbonates (process H), and (3) hematite growth into core voids (process I). The majority of the microplaty hematite mineralisation is associated with coupled processes H and I, which involve the congruent dissolution or in-situ replacement of magnetite (cores), silicates, and carbonates, followed by iron oxidation and precipitation of all Fe3+ as hematite (Table 3).\n\n\n4.6\nComplex mosaic textured hematite\nMicroplaty growth (mpH-2) can locally be so intense that the phases form massive textured zones made of interlocked, irregular shaped hematite with sizes of 10\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig. 8d, h). Ghost shapes of magnetite are evidence for locally present martite (maH-2), and there may also be metamorphic (maH-0c) and hydrothermally precipitated hematite (mpH-1b, in these textures. This complex hematite texture is named mosaic textured hematite. Mosaic textured hematite layers are characteristically present in ore at Mt. Whaleback and Mt. Tom Price, but are uncommon in smaller ore deposits and largely absent in pure martite ore deposits and in hematite-altered BIF of regional outcrops (Clout, 2005; Morris, 1985; Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2007). Mosaic hematite types have been interpreted diversely as martite recrystallisation textures (Morris, 1980), as a result of continuous compaction of the soft and porous microplaty hematite (Taylor et al., 2001), or as massive interlocking of microplaty hematite formed by non-classical crystallisation (Egglseder et al., 2019). A further discussion is not the focus of this study.\n\n\n\n5\nLA-ICPMS iron oxide chemistry\n\n5.1\nData overview\nIn most samples, the elements Al, As, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mg, Mo, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, Ti, U, V, W, and Zn yield mostly consistent data above the detection limits (see Appendix 2). Magnetite in fresh BIF, hematite-altered BIF, and ore show spectral peaks of Si and P indicating quartz and apatite inclusions. Magnetite in carbonate\u2013silicate-altered BIF show abundant Al-Ca-Mg-Mn peaks (indicating Ca-Mg-silicates) and Mg-Mn peaks (magnesite). Si and Mg are the only cations that have abundances exceeding those of other crustal magnetite types (see Appendix 2).\nFresh BIF magnetite shows chemical zoning (see Appendix 1), and microplaty hematite shows internal core and rim textures and rhythmic growth (Fig. 9). Such chemical zoning cannot be resolved at the scale of laser ablation spots (30\u201350\u00a0\u00b5m), and multiple analyses of the bulk composition should reflect the average chemistry of the (protracted) fluid-rock reaction forming the oxide. Data and statistical summary tables for magnetite, martite, mosaic hematite, and microplaty hematite of all samples are provided in Appendix 2.\nElement concentrations in oxides are highly variable across the samples set and can span over three orders of magnitude (Fig. 10\n). These large ranges are a result of integrating chemical data from all deposits and lithologies. Notwithstanding the general overlaps, median values and 1. and 3. quartile ranges show characteristic differences amongst oxide types.\nMagnetite commonly has the highest median concentrations of Si and Mg, and lowest median concentrations of Al, Mn, V, and U. Magnetite from fresh BIF samples have relatively uniform abundances for each element, with variations staying within one order of magnitude. Next to Si (<1000\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), Mg, Al, and Mn are abundant (>10\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), followed by Ti, Ba, As, Zn, V, Cr (1\u201310\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), and Cu, W, Sr, Pb, Ni, Co, Mo, Ga, U (0.1\u20131\u00a0\u00b5g\/g). These data have been combined to calculate an average sample, named the \u201cDales Gorge BIF reference magnetite\u201d (data provided in Appendix 1). For a given sample, there is a natural abundance variability and skewness in the data. Although Si has been reported as present in solid solution in magnetite (Huberty et al., 2012), Si (and Ca) are heavily affected by micro- to nano-scale quartz and apatite inclusions. These elements will be disregarded in further comparison and discussion of trace metal abundances.\nComparing hematite types with each other, martite show significantly high median values for Mn, Co, Cu, and Zn, and low median values of Mo and W. Microplaty hematite reveals highest median values for Al, V, Cr, Pb, W, Mo, and U and the lowest for Cu. Mosaic textured hematite type shows abundance affinity with magnetite, or ranges between martite and microplaty hematite. The complexity of element distribution in mosaic hematite can be best explained by the textural mixing of metamorphic hematite, martite (with magnetite-remnants), and fused microplaty hematite. We avoid a detailed discussion of the mixed chemical patterns of mosaic hematite.\nIn the sections below, we compare oxide signatures from the various alteration zones by their abundance normalised to the \u201cDales Gorge reference magnetite\u201d. For a given element, a similarity between two samples is considered robust when both medians lie within the others\u2019 1. and 3. quartile range.\n\n\n5.2\nA comment on cation compatibility in iron oxides\nBefore data from hematite and magnetite are shown and interpreted, it is necessary to discuss briefly the compatibility of various cation groups in both iron oxides. With their contrasting crystal structures, molar Fe:O ratios and Fe oxidation states, a direct comparison of magnetite and hematite chemistry to distinguish the chemistry of fluid-rock interaction may lead to erroneous interpretation. Unfortunately, there are no partitioning coefficients available for magnetite and hematite that apply to the given low-temperature fluid-rock system. Therefore, we approach this problem with a consideration of the theoretical differences in cation compatibility based on cation charge (c.f., Nadoll et al., 2014) and the possible effect of coupled substitution.\nAs an approximation, mono- and di-valent Mg and transitional metals Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Pb, (and if present Ti and Cr) have a higher compatibility in magnetite compared with hematite by simple substitution for Fe2+. In turn, tri-valent cations (Al, Ga, and the altervalent Mn, V, Ti, Cr, Mo, As, Co, Ni) theoretically have a slightly higher compatibility in hematite over magnetite. Higher-valent cations (Si and the altervalent Pb, As, Cr, V, Mo, U, and W) should only be compatible in magnetite or hematite by coupled substitution with low-valent cations, or if vacancies are formed. In the present sample set, various positive and negative correlations point to complex coupled substitutions (examples given in Appendix 1). Coupled substitution may be able to average out major structural compatibility contrast between magnetite and hematite. This allows a simplistic concept that trace metals abundances of magnetite or hematite equally inform the chemistry of the given aqueous fluid.\nSurface adsorption may be an active mechanism of elemental partitioning. Surface attachment of nanoparticles may form due to fluid supersaturation, or by surface complexation, both followed by entrapment during continuous growth of the crystal surface. Such processes have been indirectly observed or proposed for natural fine grained hematite (Sidhu et al., 1978), natural hydrothermal magnetite (Deditius et al., 2018), and experimental magnetite (Tauson et al., 2006; Tauson et al., 2018). At this point, we can only speculate on the significance of surface attachment of nanoparticles. This mechanism would likely enhance the compatibility of incompatible (high-valent) cations during low temperature formation of microplaty hematite.\n\n\n5.3\nMagnetite and hematite from Mt. Tom Price\nCompared to Dales Gorge reference magnetite, magnetite in the stage 1a distal alteration zone at Mt. Tom Price is significantly enriched in several elements (Fig. 11\na). Only Mg, Sr, and Ba are depleted, while medians of Mn, Ti, V, W, Pb, Zn are indistinct from the least-altered magnetite, i.e., they behave conservatively. The coherent abundances of various lithophile and chalcophile cations support a close genetic relationship with least-altered BIF. Notwithstanding, an overall higher metal abundance points to a higher abundance in the hydrothermal fluid. A fluid-controlled mass transfer of well soluble, low-valent cations is suggested by fractionation of Sr, Ba, Mg, Pb from As, Co, Cu, Ni (the latter group is rather enriched in stage 1a magnetite, while the former group is depleted and probably partitioned into co-genetic siderite). Introduced cations are hard or borderline acids and require compatible bases, such as CO3\n\u2013 and Cl-, for complexation. Saturation of CO3\n\u2013 is shown by abundant siderite, and fluid inclusion data show high abundances of CaCl2\n- (Hagemann et al., 1999; Thorne et al., 2004).\nMagnetite in the stage 1b intermediate alteration at Mt. Tom Price zone is characterised by most elements being significant enriched compared with the least-altered BIF (Fig. 11a). Exceptions are Mg, Al, Ti, V, and Pb, which seem to behave conservatively. Magnetite from stage 1b alteration zone shows a broad chemical similarity to magnetite from the distal alteration zone. They are genetically related. Some lithophile elements are different: elevated Mg, Sr, Ba, As, and Ni are a stage 2 fluid signals or may have been partly sourced from dissolved siderite, which has been altered to hematite-ankerite assemblage. Low Al concentration is consistent with the lack of Al-silicate gangue and related to Al undersaturation during alteration. Alternatively, oxygen fugacity may have played a governing role: magnetite\/melt partitioning coefficients of mono- und bivalent cations are positively correlated with fO2\n, while they are not for three- and four-valent cations (Sievwright et al., 2020). If this rule is applicable to the present low-temperature aqueous system, then a higher fO2\n in the intermediate zone controlled, at least some of, the Mg, Sr, Ba, As, and Ni enrichment in magnetite.\nIn stage 1b microplaty hematite, abundances of Ti, Cr and most transition metals are largely consistent with magnetite from the same alteration zone (Fig. 11b). Contrasting abundances of Al, V and most lithophile elements (bivalent Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn and three- and higher-valent Mn, U, V, Mo) are noted. Lithophile elements may behave different, because their compatibility is controlled by the crystal structure and\/or sorption at specific redox conditions and temperatures (see above). High Al may be inherited during replacement of (stage 1a) silicates, as shown petrographically by Thorne et al. (2004). Because hematite mostly post-dates magnetite (Thorne et al., 2004), the chemical affinity of both phases cannot be explain by equilibrium precipitation at the magnetite-hematite buffer. Instead, the change from magnetite-siderite to hematite-ankerite dominated alteration was a likely continuation within the same protracted fluid event, under elevated fO2\n and Ca-activity.\nMicroplaty hematite from the stage 2 Southern Batter Fault ore zone reveal abundances of most lithophiles (Sr, Ba, Mg, Ga, Ti, Cr, Mn) and chalcophiles (As, Mo, Zn, Co, Cu, Ni) that are strikingly similar to magnetite or hematite from the stage 1b alteration zones (Fig. 11b). Al, V, and U range in between abundances of stage 1b magnetite and hematite. Only W and Pb medians are outside the range of stage 1b oxides. Hematite from SE Prong ore is different to hematite from Southern Batter ore (Fig. 11f), with enrichment over Dales Gorge reference magnetite in most elements, except Mg, Mn, Zn, Co (depleted) and Mo and Pb (conservative).\nThrough all hydrothermal alteration zones within Mt. Tom Price, the suite Ga, Cr, Ti, Co, Cu, Ni behaved in a conservative manner. These elements demonstrate a close relationship amongst the alteration zones and this strongly advocates for an alteration sequence consisting of stage 1 BIF alteration (with the distal stage 1a zone being closer related to fresh BIF magnetite than the slightly younger oxidised intermediate stage 1b zone) and stage 2 ore formation (with signatures mostly inherited from oxides of the stage 1b zone). In contrast to the conservative (thus inherited) element suite, the modification of Al, Mo, Pb, U, V, Mn (decreased) and Sr, Ba, and W (enriched) in ore-related hematite are evidence for mass mobilisation (Fig. 12\na). Dissolution of stage 1 phases (magnetite, Fe-carbonates and Fe-silicates) may have contributed to the element budget in stage 2 oxides. However, the exact influence of pre-cursor phases remains speculative for Mt. Tom Price, partly because the spatially (i.e., fault) controlled overriding effect of stage 2 mineralisation on the hematite chemistry remains unknown.\n\n\n5.4\nHematite from Mt. Whaleback\nMicroplaty hematite from Mt. Whaleback, Central Fault related ore, is enriched in most elements compared with Dales Gorge reference magnetite, except depleted Mg and conservative Ti (Fig. 11c). Martite shows overall lower abundances, but element ratios are strikingly similar to those in microplaty hematite. In samples most distal from the Central Fault, most elements in microplaty hematite show abundances much higher than those in the least-altered magnetite (see positive deviation from unity in Fig. 12b). Approaching the Central Fault, elements systematically fractionate following three distinct trends: a depletion trend (Mg, Mn, U, Ti, V, Cr, Zn, Cu, Co), an enrichment trend (Al, Pb, Mo), and a conservative trend (Sr, Ba, Ga, W, As, Ni). Here, Mn and U are still enriched compared with magnetite in least altered BIF. The signature of vein-type microplaty hematite in BIF close to Central Fault (D302-46.5) is comparable to hematite in ore (with the exception of Mg and Mn). This shows that oxides chemistry, by large, may be sensitive to gradients in fluid-rock interaction but rather insensitive to the degree of gangue leaching. Only decreasing Mg and Mn concentrations are in line with gangue leaching.\nMicroplaty hematite from Whaleback Fault related ore, is depleted in Mg and enriched in Al, U, Mo, W, and Ni compared with Dales Gorge reference magnetite (Fig. 11d). Martite signatures are overall not similar to those in microplaty hematite with contrasting Ti, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu. Approaching the Whaleback Fault splays, microplaty hematite shows partitioning trends distinct from those noted at the Central Fault (Fig. 12c): A depletion trend is shown by Mg, an enrichment trend by Al, Ti, V, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Co, and overall conservative, yet wavy, signatures are shown by Sr, Ba, Mn, Ga, As, U, W, Mo, Pb, and Zn.\nThe diverse element concentration trends towards Central and Whaleback Fault zones inform the mineralising stage 2 fluid-rock interaction. Although it is impossible to quantify cation abundances in the fluid without knowing the partitioning and sorption coefficients, the relative behaviour of the cation groups can be used to consistently explain the characteristics of fluid-rock interaction. The element patterns in hematite distal to Central and Whaleback Faults are least influenced by the fault-related fractionation trends (Fig. 12b). The specific signatures inform the pre-existing mineral chemistry. Because these signatures are distinct from fresh magnetite, a chemical modification of iron oxides prior to fault-controlled hematite mineralisation is suggested. Following the nomenclature used for Mt. Tom Price, this alteration imprint is termed \u201cstage 1CF\/WF\u201d (where CF stands for Central Fault, and WF for Whaleback Fault). Stage 1CF\/WF alterations are not observed in the rock mineralogy, so it must have been completely obliterated by the subsequent \u201cstage 2CF\/WF\u201d hematite mineralisation and oxidation. However, stage 1CF\/WF is \u201ccryptically\u201d preserved in hematite chemistry distant from the fault.\nThe contrasting abundances and gradients of distinct cation groups are explained with country rock reservoir signatures and gradients of fluid-rock ratio, fO2\n, and pH, with progressive infiltration into the orebody. With progressed infiltration away from faults, the fluid-rock ratio decreases, fO2\n decreases due to progressive oxidation of magnetite, Fe(II)-rich silicate, and carbonate phases, and alkalinity (pH) increases with progressive dissolution of Fe-carbonates. Assuming a typical oxidised, low-saline, non-evolved, meteoric fluid (groundwater: Fitts, 2002) representative for stage 2, with estimated eH 0 to 0.8\u00a0V and pH 3 to 6 (Fig. 13), the following cation valences predominate as dissolved species: Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Co4+, Ti5+, V4+\/5+, U5+\/6+, As5+, and Cr3+\/6+, according to fluid speciation calculation using The Geochemist\u2019s Workbench\u00a9 (Bethke, 1998). These cations are incompatible in prevailing hematite. Accordingly, hematite close to the Central Fault is depleted in these cations. Their elevated concentration in hematite with increasing distance from the fault may partly be related to speciation, as cation valences may change (while this is not the case for Mn2+: Fig. 13), but most likely reflects the combined effects of a decreasing fluid-rock ratio and the consequential increasing chemical inheritance from pre-existing oxides (see further discussion below on oxide-forming mechanism). The contrastingly enriched Al, Pb and Mo proximal to Central Fault, as well as Mn and U contents that are higher compared to the least-altered BIF magnetite despite a depletion trend, may be the signature of an evolved crustal (shale, granite) country rock reservoir. An additional effect on Al concentration is related to the pH gradient: At pH\u00a0<\u00a04, Al3+ and positively charged Al-OH complexes predominate in solution (Fig. 13\n). With the increase of fluid pH to 6, distal to the fault, weakly soluble Al(OH)3 predominates, leading to the observed decrease of Al uptake in hematite. The upper pH limit of the system is 6, when soluble Al(OH)- begins to dominate.\nThe Whaleback Fault orebody signatures are very different to those at the Central Fault. Ore samples are significantly enriched in the \u201cgranitophile\u201d element group, compared with fresh magnetite. This element group can be interpreted as the relic signature of a cryptic stage 1WF (Fig. 12c). The trend towards the Whaleback Fault shows a marked increase in a \u201cbasaltophile\u201d element suite. Contrastingly, depleted Mg, being also a \u201cbasaltophile\u201d element, is likely related to low compatibility in hematite over the initially high concentration in pre-existing magnetite. The Whaleback Fault scenario points to a rock reservoir-controlled stage 2WF fluid composition. The conservation of the stage 1WF element suite suggests, in contrast to the Central Fault scenario, that fO2\n and fluid-rock ratio were not the controlling factors for element fractionation \u2013 initial fluid-rock ratios were thus limited, compared with the larger Central Fault system.\n\n\n5.5\nMagnetite and hematite from the eastern region orebodies\nMagnetite in distal BIF alteration at Eastern Ridge is distinct from Dales Gorge reference magnetite (Fig. 11e). While V is the only element that is significantly enriched, the suite of Sr, Ba, Mg, Al, Cr, Zn, Co, Cu are depleted. Other elements behave conservatively. Distinctive low cation abundances of lithophile and chalcophile cations, as well as a large suite of conservative cations in magnetite are in contrast to stage 1 signatures at Mt. Tom Price (compare Fig. 11a with e). These alteration zones are thus genetically unrelated, with magnetite at Eastern Ridge showing slightly more pristine metamorphic signatures.\nMicroplaty hematite from the eastern region orebodies Hashimoto, Homestead, and Mt. Helen, show variable enrichment\/depletion trends (Fig. 11e). However, an overall enrichment of Al, V, Cr, Mn, U, Mo, and Ni, and depletion of Mg, Zn, Co, and Cu is evident. Hashimoto and Mt. Helen show a close affinity based on largely comparable enrichment\/depletion trends. Ore-forming hematite in the eastern province samples are thus chemically related to each other. Comparing hematite with hydrothermally altered magnetite from Eastern Ridge BIF, most chalcophile elements are strikingly similar, supporting a cryptic proto-ore stage 1EP (EP for Eastern Province) in ore. This is comparable with the preserved alteration at Eastern Ridge. Lithophile elements Al, Cr, Mn, U, Mo, and W in hematite (W not in Homestead) show distinctive high abundances compared with magnetite, indicating that fluid-rock interaction during stage 2EP mineralisation effectively added these elements to ore. This would require an abundance of these elements in the mineralising fluid, most likely induced by the scavenging of diverse country rocks.\n\n\n5.6\nDiscriminative element abundances and ratios\nThe immobility of Al and mobility of Mg lead to an inverse behaviour of both elements during ore formation. Thus, the Al\/Mg ratio (Fig. 14\na) is a measure of relative maturity of stage-2 hematite mineralisation (Fig. 12). The Al\/Mg ratio discriminates the most mature Central Fault ore from less mature Whaleback Fault and Mt. Tom Price ore zones. The distal ore samples at Mt. Whaleback are characteristically less mature. For hematite from alteration stage 1b in Mt. Tom Price this ratio is not applicable, because elements are influence by co-existing carbonates and silicates.\nThe ratios Ni\/Pb and Cr\/U can distinguish source rocks that were scavenged by the mineralising hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 14b, c). This is because of their contrasting rock affinity (Ni and Cr to primitive, mafic, rocks and Pb and U to fractionated, felsic, rocks or shale). In this respect, Mt. Tom Price and Whaleback Central Fault stage 1 show a mixed rock signature, while Whaleback Fault stage 1 shows an evolved (felsic\/shale) signature. In the proximal stage 2, ore signatures are always shifted, pointing either to a more mafic (Mt. Tom Price and Whaleback Fault) or more evolved (Central Fault) country rock reservoir.\nThe sum Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn (Fig. 14d) is a proxy for fluid salinity or temperature during BIF alteration and should be independent of source reservoirs. Using this parameter, Central Fault orebody show highest salinity or temperature, followed by Mt. Tom Price and Whaleback Fault orebody. The three Eastern Ridge orebodies show lowest salinity or temperature.\nThe binary Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Zn versus Zn\/Cu diagram (Fig. 14e) combines the fluid salinity\/temperature and metal source parameters. Fields and trends are in accordance to the characteristics shown in the box plots.\nIron oxide data from the hydrothermal alteration zones approach the signatures typical for Ag-Pb-Zn deposits in the binary Ti\u00a0+\u00a0V versus Al\u00a0+\u00a0Mn diagram of Nadoll et al. (2014) (Fig. 14f). Thus, oxide chemistry support metasomatism of BIF during interaction with hot, saline, brines (Thorne et al., 2007; Thorne et al., 2004). It is suggested that lithophile elements (Al, Mn, Ti, V) in iron oxides may be valid fluid indicators, independent of the observed mineral system (sulfide or oxide). However, based on the discussion in section 5.2, the applicability of magnetite discrimination diagrams for hematite may be limited due to contrasting compatibility, especially of Al3+.\n\n\n5.7\nPrincipal component Analysis\nThe principal components PC1, PC2 and PC3 capture \u223c76% of the total variance of the geochemical dataset (Fig. 15\na). Further principal components are insignificant for the interpretation of geochemical variances. The data summary of the PCA are provided in Appendix 1.\nThe PC1, with an eigenvalue of 47.8%, discriminates Mo, U, W, and Mg from all other elements, indicating that these elements are generally anticorrelated to all others (see loading plot Fig. 15b). The PC2 with an eigenvalue of 14. 5 is useful for further discriminating element groups. In the PC1-PC2 RQ-diagram, four groups are discriminated: (group 1) Al-Mn-Cr-As-Pb-Ba-Sr, (group 2) Ga-Ti-V-Co-Zn-Cu-Ni, (group 3) Mo-W-U, and (4) Mg. The PC3 has an eigenvalue of 14.3%, and in the PC2-PC3 RQ-diagram, element discrimination is not very clear (see loading plot Fig. 15c).\nThe sample score in the RQ1-RQ2 diagram reveals data clustering that permits discrimination of the sampled deposits (Fig. 15d). The Central Fault and Whaleback Fault ore zones are discriminated, mainly base on PC1. The Central Fault ore zone is largely defined by element groups 1 and 2, while the Whaleback Fault ore zone defined by group 3 and 4. The sampled eastern region orebodies Hashimoto, Homestead, and Mt. Helen correspond to the Whaleback Fault score. The Mt. Tom Price samples generally show weaker scores, i.e., are closer to the origin, and cluster between Central Fault and Whaleback Fault related ore. Remarkably, microplaty hematite in ore and intermediate alteration zone plot in the same area, supporting their corresponding origin.\nThe RQ2-RQ3 diagram allows a further examination of the dataset with respect to fault proximity within the Mt. Whaleback ore zones (Fig. 15e). Discrimination of proximal and distal ore is mainly based on PC3, where ore distal to Central Fault overlaps with ore proximal to Whaleback Fault. Both correspond to the loading groups Co, Ni, V, and Mn, Cr, W, Al, U. Data from the SE Prong Fault overlaps with the Whaleback Fault distal cluster.\nThe multivariate data analyses of hematite composition successfully discriminate orebodies and fault-proximity within orebodies based on element correlation. Furthermore, overlapping data clusters suggest \u201chidden\u201d compositional relationships of Whaleback Fault ore to SE Prong Fault and to Eastern region orebodies. The element groups consisting of low-and high-valent cations provide support for the importance of coupled substitution (see above).\n\n\n\n6\nOxide-forming mechanisms and impact on mineral chemistry\n\n6.1\nHydrothermal magnetite re-equilibration\nPossible mineralogical and crystal-chemical processes of re-equilibration of magnetite composition during hydrothermal alteration are: (a) partitioning of elements by solid-state diffusion including types of oxy-exsolution, (b) dynamic recrystallisation with coupled cation mobility, and (c) static CDR.\nDynamic magnetite recrystallisation has been rarely described in natural rocks. Dislocation creep in magnetite requires rock deformation at temperatures above 300\u00a0\u00b0C (Till and Moskowitz, 2013). This mechanism can be ruled out here, as syn-metamorphic BIF deformation preceded ore formation.\nAccording to Watson and Baxter (2007), solid state diffusion in rock-forming minerals at fluid temperatures\u00a0<\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C is noneffective for geological crystal size and time scales. However, at elevated temperatures, several studies have confirmed Fe and O self-diffusion in magnetite (Aggarwal and Dieckmann, 2002; Atkinson et al., 1983; Castle and Surman, 1969), and in sub-micron magnetite grains significant Fe diffusion may occur even at very low temperature (Gorski et al., 2012). Experiments in magnetite-silicate melt systems show that diffusion coefficients increase in the order Cr\u00a0<\u00a0Mo\u00a0<\u00a0V\u00a0<\u00a0Ti\u00a0<\u00a0Al\u00a0<\u00a0Ga\u00a0<\u00a0Ni\u00a0<\u00a0U \u2248 Zn\u00a0<\u00a0Mn \u2248 Mg\u00a0<\u00a0Co\u00a0<\u00a0Cu (Sievwright et al., 2020). Diffusion leads to the homogenisation of chemical zones and may exsolve accessory phases, such as anatase, Al-bearing spinels, or oxides.\nCDR may be a mode of textural and chemical re-equilibration that is independent of deformation (Altree-Williams et al., 2015; Putnis, 2002; Putnis and Putnis, 2007; Ruiz-Agudo et al., 2014). CDR may take place at high fluid\/rock ratios, where fluid temperature, salinity, pressure, and fO2, are critical for fluid-mineral interface-controlled magnetite dissolution (Hemley and Hunt, 1992). Evidence for natural hydrothermal modification of magnetite chemistry by pseudomorphous CDR come from some albitised granitoids (Wen et al., 2017) and skarn mineralisation (Hu et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2014). The minerals affected by CDR are typically porous (Putnis, 2002), which applies to the magnetite in altered BIF (Fig. 6e). Chemical modification of magnetite during pseudomorphous transformation is in general accordance to examples from the literature, despite variable signatures (Hu et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2017). In summary, we tentatively consider CDR as the most likely scenario for the modification of magnetite textures and chemistries preserved in the Mt. Tom Price alteration zones.\n\n\n6.2\nCoupled dissolution-transfer-precipitation of ore-forming hematite\nAny proposition of a stage 2 hematite precipitation mechanism must be compatible with the fault-controlled chemical fractionation trends observed at Central and Whaleback faults. In all ore zones, hematite ore frequently shows abundant dissolved cores of magnetite or its Fe-deficient relative kenomagnetite, within porous martites rims and microplaty hematite grown epitaxially into these cores or outside the grains (Fig. 8g). These textures are evidence for the availability of Fe (and trace metals) from magnetite\/kenomagnetite dissolution. Several mineralogical factors can control the solubility and dissolution kinetics of iron oxide: (1) grain size, (2) mineral species, with solubility of magnetite\u00a0>\u00a0kenomagnetite\u00a0>\u00a0maghemite (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003; Schwertmann, 1991), and (3) concentration of inhibiting cations, such as Al (Schwertmann, 1991), Si (Huberty et al., 2012), and transition metals Co, Ni, Zn, Cu, Mn, V, and Cr (Liang et al., 2013; Sidhu, 1988).\nConservation, i.e., inheritance, of chemical signatures in hematite is consistent with quantitative recovery of metal from dissolved magnetite. Dissolution implies that the stage 2CF fluid was (initially) Fe-depleted, consistent with low-saline meteoric water (Thorne et al., 2009), but gained Fe from dissolved oxides, silicates, and carbonates of stage 1CF. The trace metal signature in hematite close to the fault closely represents highest stage 2CF fluid-rock ration, but with distance, corresponding with decreasing fluid-rock ratio, fO2\n, and increasing pH (Fig. 13), the inherited signature from the locally dissolved pre-existing oxides becomes stronger.\nMicroplaty hematite mineralisation may here be described as a coupled oxidative dissolution-transfer-reprecipitation process (CDTR), with mass mobilisation taken place over at least some \u00b5m distance. Thus, CDTR is a magnetite-hematite transformation type similar to the mechanism proposed by Lagoeiro (1998) described for pressure-solution-aided deformation of itabirite ore in Brazil. The largely similar trace metal chemistry of microplaty hematite and martite (Fig. 11) shows that both modifications occurred contemporaneous, and mass transfer is the only difference between microplaty hematite-forming CDTR and martite-forming CDR. The similarity of martite and microplaty hematite is shown in the Central Fault ore, but to a lesser extent in the Whaleback Fault ore. This can be explained by the stronger influence of externally sourced Fe and trace metals in the Whaleback Fault system.\n\n\n\n7\nThe ore-forming fluid-rock systems in the geological context\nThe models presented here for the Mt. Whaleback and Mt. Tom Price orebodies are based on evidence derived from rock alteration, oxide textures, mineral chemistry, and published information that is linked to the geological context. Fig. 16\n depicts the geological settings and structurally controlled compositional characteristics of orebodies. Despite evident similarities across the studied deposits, ore-forming stages show considerable variation related to the main controlling structures.\nStages preceding ore formation are regionally uniform and just summarised briefly: Primarily sedimented particles consist of opaline (gel) and Fe-rich hydroxides, carbonate, and silicates. Oxidising volatilisation occurred during diagenetic and early metamorphism, with sedimented matter being dehydrated and replaced by hematite and chert, with minor silicates and carbonates (Rasmussen et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2016). Metamorphism with peak temperatures at 270\u2013310\u00a0\u00b0C during the Ophthalmian orogeny transformed most, yet not all, hematite (Posth et al., 2013) or siderite (Rasmussen and Muhling, 2018) into magnetite. The Si enrichment of magnetite in BIF has been described as typical for the Dales Gorge BIF and many other sub-greenschist facies BIFs worldwide (Huberty et al., 2012). The primary presence of organic matter may have created reducing conditions necessary to stabilize silician magnetite (Huberty et al., 2012). Alternatively it may be an inheritance of the transformed siderite (c.f., Rasmussen and Muhling, 2018). Elevated Mg in BIF may an effect of relatively high element abundance in the hydrothermal plume-fertilised Paleoproterozoic seawater. Local schistose hematite textures in shear zones (see Eastern Ridge) are evidence for deformation-controlled growth of hematite. All these transformation processes occurred prior to mineralisation and are unrelated to iron ore (Morris and Kneeshaw, 2011, and references therein; Thorne et al., 2008, and references therein).\n\n7.1\nThe Mt. Tom Price Southern Batter Fault ore forming system\nThe stage 1a magnetite-siderite-stilpnomelane\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite alteration at Mt. Tom Price took place after peak metamorphism (Thorne et al., 2009; Thorne et al., 2004). According to previous studies, distal alteration in BIF took place during infiltration of 100 to 192\u00a0\u00b0C, reduced brines with a high salinity of 24.0 to 26.0\u00a0wt% CaCl2 equivalency (Hagemann et al., 1999; Thorne et al., 2004). Low \u03b413Csiderite (-8.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 \u2030) and \u03b4 18Ofluid (-0.6 to 0.8 \u2030) suggest equilibration with evolved (evaporated) CO3\n\u2013-rich seawater (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2009).\nUnder the influence of this fluid, metamorphic magnetite was altered via CDR resulting in a porosity increase and chemical re-equilibration. The extended suite of introduced elements during stage 1a alteration (Fig. 11a) points to mixed source reservoirs. Given a rather reduced fluid-rock state, weakly soluble, yet enriched lithophile metals Al, Ga, Cr, U, and Mo, were probably sourced from a local shale, such as Dales Gorge shale macrobands or Mt. McRae Shale. Siderite abundance points to a carbonate reservoir.\nThe stage 1b ankerite-chlorite-hematite-magnetite alteration took place after stage 1a (Thorne et al., 2004). This intermediate zone may be a locally restricted replacement product after the distal zone, which is suggested by replacement of stilpnomelane with hematite, siderite with ankerite plus hematite, and magnetite with martite (Thorne et al., 2004). The alteration fluid was a hot brine, evidenced by fluid inclusion data in ankerite (153 to 346\u00a0\u00b0C and 22.4 to 24.3\u00a0wt% CaCl2 equivalency) (Hagemann et al., 1999; Thorne et al., 2004). The \u03b4 13Cankerite signature of-4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 \u2030 (elevated compared with stage 1a siderite) and the low \u03b4 18Ofluid of \u22123.5 to 4.5 \u2030 was interpreted to be a result of interaction with carbonate sequences and the influence of meteoric water (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2009; Thorne et al., 2004). The overall higher elemental abundance in magnetite and hematite from stage 1b, especially high V in hematite, supports higher fluid temperature and\/or salinity (Ilton and Eugster, 1989; Nadoll et al., 2014; Nadoll et al., 2012). Indicator elements Sr, Mg, Mn, Pb suggest a seawater carbonate source for stage 1b. This is compatible with interpretations that favoured diagenetic brines that previously interacted with stratigraphically underlying carbonate-shale Wittenoom Formation and then mixed with evolved meteoric water (Hagemann et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2001). Evans et al. (2013) postulated evaporitic brine pools in the stratigraphy high above the Brockman IF. Hematite with elevated U, W, Mo is compatible with fluids that have scavenged an evolved rock reservoir (shales, granitoids). Whether some input of magmatic fluids was relevant during protracted, poly-phase ore formation (Rasmussen et al., 2007a), e.g., from granites such as the 1820\u20131775\u00a0Ma Moorarie Supersuite (Krapez and McNaughton, 1999; Sheppard et al., 2010) cannot be ruled out.\nThe main ore-forming stage 2 martite-microplaty hematite-apatite alteration formed by the interaction with abundant low-temperature (65\u00b0\u2013110\u00a0\u00b0C) meteoric water (Thorne et al., 2007; Thorne et al., 2004). Higher temperatures for hematite mineralisation may be suggested from Al\u00a0+\u00a0Mn vs. Ti\u00a0+\u00a0V diagram (Fig. 14f). However, these elevated elemental concentrations may also reflect inheritance of the hydrothermal magnetite source, as suggested for oxygen isotope inheritance in ore (Gutzmer et al., 2006; Thorne et al., 2009). Thorne et al. (2009) demonstrated that with proximity to the Southern Batter Fault, a meteoric water signature becomes stronger (i.e., decreasing \u03b4 18O in hematite). The great amount of warm, low-saline meteoric fluid with a low metal-transport capacity formed hematite without significant cation enrichment proximal to the controlling fault. Unfortunately, we do not have data from Mt. Tom Price that could provide evidence of structural control on stage 2 hematite trace elemental chemistry.\n\n\n7.2\nThe Mt. Whaleback ore forming systems\nAt Mt. Whaleback, unlike Mt. Tom Price, hydrothermal BIF alteration zones surrounding ore are not preserved. Fe-carbonate-chlorite altered Mt. McRae shale discovered in the footwall of Mt. Whaleback ore may be a distal relic of such alteration (Webb et al., 2004). Fluid inclusions in quartz-hematite veins distal to ore support Cl-- and transition metal-rich brines and\/or evolved meteoric water with temperatures between 200 and 420\u00a0\u00b0C (Brown et al., 2004; Powell et al., 1999). While this fluid flow may well be involved in a silica-bearing hematite \u201cproto-ore\u201d alteration, the hematite ore formation itself, during which quartz dissolution prevailed, was related to a different fluid flow.\nBased on hematite chemistry in ore, a novel fluid-flow\/alteration model is proposed: The enriched metal suite in ore-forming hematite distal to Central Fault is a relic signature of an earlier iron oxide alteration stage 1CF. Enriched Mn, Sr, Ba, U, and Cr are reservoir indicators: Mn, Sr and Ba are chemical proxies of a fluid interacting with carbonates and\/or evaporites, and U and Cr enrichment require oxidised fluids, in which soluble U6+ and Cr6+ predominate. The proto-ore alteration indeed shows similar characteristics as Mt. Tom Price stage 1a and 1b sequence, while some contrasting signatures are indicators of distinct fluids.\nAbundant dusty and fibrous hematite textures within hematite-altered BIF haloes surrounding ore provide textural evidence for a stage 1CF silicate alteration. Indications of significant carbonate in stage 1CF proto-ore are lacking. Carbonate precipitation was reduced to a minimum, probably because of higher quartz stability in the alteration zone or lack of CO3\n\u2013 ions in the fluid.\nProximity trend of element abundances in hematite (Fig. 12), in conjunction with lowest \u03b4 18O in hematite within Central Fault (Angerer et al., 2013a), are strong evidence for fault-controlled fluid flow and associated hematite mineralisation at Mt. Whaleback. High fO2\n, low temperature, low saline, and low pH are specific signatures for these meteoric waters. Enriched Al, Pb, Mo, (Mn, U) may be sourced from an evolved rock reservoir, such as shales of the Dales Gorge Member or Mt. McRae Formation. The overall lack of cations in microplaty hematite proximal to the fault is compatible with fluids of low temperature (65\u00b0\u2013110\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinity (Thorne et al., 2007; Thorne et al., 2004), while higher temperatures may not be disregarded based on the empirical thermometer (Fig. 14f). Inherited signatures dominate with increasing distance from the fault.\nIn summary, the complex (protracted) structurally controlled mineralisation model related to Central Fault matches the model for the Southern Batter Fault ore zone at Mt. Tom Price. The enormous sizes of the orebodies and the existence of high-grade ore in zones most distal to the controlling fault required a protracted ore forming event, most likely over several hydrothermal pulses (Rasmussen et al., 2007b). The zonal hematite growth textures suggest polyphase hematite growth via CDTR.\nThe Whaleback Fault, with an estimated age of ca. 1.88\u00a0Ga (Tyler, 1991), has been considered to post-date hematite ore (Morris and Kneeshaw, 2011; Powell et al., 1999; Ronaszeki, 1992; Ronaszeki, 2010; Thorne et al., 2008). Structurally controlled oxide formation and\/or re-equilibration related to Whaleback Fault is supported by oxygen isotope data that show much lower \u03b4 18O values in Whaleback Fault than distal to the fault (Angerer et al., 2013a). At Whaleback Fault, ore is juxtaposed against largely fresh country rocks (Powell et al., 1999), which contradicts the structural control model. This can be explained with post-mineralisation reactivation, which is supported by abundant ore clasts within the fault (Angerer et al., 2013a).\nThe conservation of a large suite of elements suggests a minor role for proto-ore BIF alteration stage 1WF in the Whaleback Fault ore zone. \u201cGranitophile\u201d elements (Al, U, W, Mo) are enriched, suggesting that stage 1WF fluids interacted with evolved rock reservoir, i.e., granites or shales (Mason and Moore, 1982). Granitic rocks of the Sylvania Inlier, just a few kilometres south of the ore deposit (Tyler, 1991), are connected with the deposit site by the Whaleback Fault. As suggested for Mt. Tom Price, also the 1820\u20131775\u00a0Ma Moorarie Supersuite (Krapez and McNaughton, 1999; Sheppard et al., 2010) may have provided minor input of magmatic fluids. In contrast, enriched \u201cbasaltophile\u201d elements suggests that the stage 2WF mineralising fluid likely passed through and scavenged mafic rock sequences. The Jeerinah Formation, which is juxtaposed against mineralised Dales Gorge at the Whaleback Fault, is a potential source for this element suite (Fig. 16c). This implies that the Whaleback Fault controlled protracted fluid-rock alteration through stages 1 and 2.\nFluid temperature and salinity during stage 1WF are unknown, but low Ti and V abundances in hematite suggest lower temperatures compared with the stage 1CF system (c.f., Nadoll et al., 2014), and the inheritance of stage 1WF signatures close to the fault suggest a lower fluid-rock ratio. Discriminative element ratios (Fig. 14a) and the PCA (Fig. 15d) reveal a close affinity of the Eastern Region ore with the Mt. Whaleback Fault ore signatures. It is proposed that ore formation associated with the late stage Whaleback Fault system acted across the entire eastern region.\n\n\n7.3\nImplications for opposing genetic models\nOxide chemistry presented in this study supports a multistage hydrothermal alteration model for the southern Ophthalmia hematite ore deposits. Several key observations challenge different genetic models, particularly the supergene-metamorphic model (Morris, 1985; Morris and Fletcher, 1987) and non-classical hematite crystallisation by particle coalescence (Egglseder et al., 2019):\n(1) Nucleation of hematite on martite or globular hematite surfaces indicates precipitation out of a hydrothermal solution. Protracted microplaty hematite precipitation from hydrothermal solution is also supported from the zonal growth textures. This is not expected for hematite growth via goethite dehydration or by particle coalescence.\n(2) The inheritance of chemical signatures from hydrothermal carbonate\u2013silicate-oxide BIF alteration zones in ore and hematite-altered BIF close to ore is not compatible with post-ore alteration as suggested by Morris and Kneeshaw (2011).\n(3) The overall cation abundance of iron oxides is a proxy for formation temperature (Dupuis and Beaudoin, 2011; Ilton and Eugster, 1989; Nadoll et al., 2014). Specifically, the Ti\u00a0+\u00a0V and Al\u00a0+\u00a0Mn compositions of hydrothermal iron oxides plot into the empirical temperature field of 200\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C from Nadoll et al. (2014) (Fig. 14f), and thus support fluid inclusion thermometry data for hydrothermal BIF alteration at Mt. Tom Price (Thorne et al., 2007; Thorne et al., 2004). Temperatures of hematite mineralisation, previously implied to be ranging between 60 and 110\u00a0\u00b0C (Morris, 1985; Thorne et al., 2009), may also be higher \u2013 which would be compatible with data from other hematite deposits worldwide (Cope et al., 2008; Rosi\u00e8re and Rios, 2004).\n(4) Hematite mineralisation related to interaction with rather cold, metal-diluted, meteoric water, is associated with a depletion gradient towards the controlling Central Fault. If hematite inherited its chemistry from goethite, the chemical gradient would follow the structurally controlled goethite gradients with most intense element enrichment close to the fault. Although such enrichment gradients are preserved in the Whaleback Fault system, abundant pre- or syn-hematite sulphides and carbonates in relatively fresh rock in and close to the fault zone (Angerer et al., 2013a) do not support hematite after goethite in a saprolitic zone.\n(5) Published phosphate U\/Pb ages (Rasmussen et al., 2007b) support protracted hematite growth during multiple hydrothermal pulses. Dates are largely compatible with regional extensional tectonic phases. Morris and Kneeshaw (2011) dismissed this argument, stating that protracted mineral growth was related to repeated increase of the thermal gradient to >80\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThis study shows that trace element chemistry of magnetite and hematite from LA-ICPMS analyses and EPMA elemental mapping allow fingerprinting of fluid-rock interaction in complex BIF-hosted alteration systems. Oxide chemistry data for Mt. Tom Price provides evidence for the direct spatial coincidence of microplaty ore and pre-existing BIF alteration, and thus supports existing multi-stage hydrothermal alteration models (Taylor et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2009; Thorne et al., 2004). A genetic link across alteration zones is revealed by conservative elements in magnetite from fresh and altered BIF, and similarly enriched elements in hematite from altered BIF and ore. Based on the cation-enriched ore-forming hematite, a new two-stage, structurally controlled hydrothermal model is offered for Mt. Whaleback, despite the apparent obliteration of all proto-ore.\nThe proximity to controlling faults has a significant effect on trace elemental patterns in oxides, similar to oxygen isotopes equilibration trends (Thorne et al., 2009). Overall hematite compositions allow the differentiation of ore zones: For Mt. Whaleback, a Central Fault and Whaleback Fault orebody are differentiated.\nCoupled dissolution-transfer-precipitation (CDTR) is proposed as the main mineralisation process, that acted in addition to in-situ (pseudomorphic) CDR (i.e., martitisation). Most microplaty hematite formed by CDTR from metals in the fluid phase that were sourced from close-by dissolved magnetite (or kenomagnetite) and Fe-rich gangue in altered BIF. Element distribution maps of oxides provide evidence for CDTR, revealing an internal chemical complexity of magnetite with cation-depleted zones of enhanced solubility and the particular growth style and core-rim relationships of microplaty hematite. Trace metal abundances prove a chemical and genetic relationship between ore hematite and proto-ore magnetite.\nTemperature, fluid-rock ratio, cation abundance (from rock reservoir scavenging), oxidation state, and pH in the fluid-rock systems govern element partitioning in magnetite and hematite. The abundance of cation species that are rather incompatible in iron oxide structure (i.e., Si, Ca, Ba, Sr, Pb, and high-valent, oxidised cations U, Mo, W, V, Ti) reveals the importance of coupled substitution and qualitatively elucidates oxidation state, possible fluid source, and\/or scavenged rock reservoir. It is however evident that more empirical and experimental research is needed to quantify controlling factors of fractionation that occur with iron oxide crystallisation. Because in-situ analyses allow us to probe single alteration stages within complexly juxtaposed alteration zones, this approach complements whole-rock geochemistry in the understanding of hydrothermal mineral systems.\n\n\nData availability\nAll laser ablation ICM-PS data for this study are provided in Appendix 2 (Exel format).\n\n","30":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMany clastic dominant (CD)-type base metal deposits (e.g. McArthur River, Teena) have been discovered in the southern McArthur Basin, northern Australia, and the McArthur River deposit is the largest and most representative deposit in this region (Fig. 1\nA; Ahmad et al., 2013). The world-class McArthur River Zn-Pb deposit (originally known as \u201cHere\u2019s Your Chance\u201d with an abbreviation of \u201cHYC\u201d) is hosted by the Paleoproterozoic Barney Creek Formation (BCF), with mineralisation mainly occurring in the HYC Pyritic Shale Member within the BCF (Williams, 1978a). Understanding the formation processes of this deposit is critical for discovering the next giant Zn-Pb orebody in the region. Numerous studies have made significant contributions to an improving understanding of the ore-forming process of the deposit (Croxford and Jephcott, 1972; Lambert, 1976; Williams, 1978a; Eldridge et al., 1993; Large and McGoldrick, 1998; Lindsay, 2001; Ireland et al., 2004; Symons, 2007; Spinks et al., 2020), redox chemical features and temperature of hydrothermal fluids (Cooke et al., 2000; Large et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2003; Ireland et al., 2004; Symons, 2007; Williford et al., 2011; Spinks et al., 2020), and spatial scale of the mineralisation system (Large et al., 2000; Large et al., 2001; Mukherjee and Large, 2017). Both syngenetic and epigenetic models were proposed in previous studies as controversial mechanisms for the ore formation processes (Large et al., 2005). The syngenetic model was proposed mainly based on the observation that base metal sulphides display stratiform textures (Ireland et al., 2004), whereas similar textures can also be formed by the epigenetic replacement of carbonates by sulphides (Leach et al., 2010). Recent in-situ elemental mapping of mineralised samples and thermodynamic modelling results provide strong evidence for an epigenetic ore formation process at the McArthur River region (Spinks et al., 2020), which formed from low-temperature (<200 \u2103) (Large et al., 2001; Ireland et al., 2004), SO4\n2--dominated, acidic to near-neutral brines (Cooke et al., 2000; Spinks et al., 2020). Despite of this knowledge, the spatial scale of the ore-related hydrothermal activity is not well constrained, hindering the further exploration of Zn-Pb deposits in this region.\nThe lines of evidence from previous studies suggest that hydrothermal activity is likely to be constrained surrounding the McArthur River deposit. For example, many similar base metal deposits and prospects are found to the vicinity of the McArthur River deposit (Ahmad et al., 2013). Lithogeochemical (Lambert and Scott, 1973; Large et al., 2000) and carbon\/oxygen isotopic halos also show that the influence of fluids was restricted within the region 23\u00a0km away from the deposit (Large et al., 2001). However, a recent identified profile with erratically-distributed bitumen reflectance for the BCF at the depocenter of the Glyde sub-basin suggests hydrothermal infiltration at approximately 100\u00a0km away southeast to the deposit (Rodrigues et al., 2015). This may imply a more widespread Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system in the southern McArthur Basin. Hydrothermal alteration is one of the key vectors for the exploration of hydrothermal base metal deposits. If a wider Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system existed yet similar base metal deposits are absent within the hydrothermal haloes, other constrains should be considered in the ore formation model to improve the mineral exploration efficiency and accuracy.\nTo test whether there is a more widespread Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system than previously expected, we examined the trace element geochemistry of fine-grained pyrites in the non-mineralized BCF intersected by the drill-hole Lamont Pass 3. It has been well recognized that the widely distributed fine-grained pyrite in the BCF is an indicator of district-scale hydrothermal activity (Smith and Croxford, 1973; Williams and Rye, 1974; Williams, 1978a, b; Lambert, 1982; Maynard, 1983; Goodfellow and Jonasson, 1986; Eldridge et al., 1993; Painter et al., 1999; Magnall et al., 2016; Magnall et al., 2020a, b; Rieger et al., 2020). The trace element distribution pattern in fine-grained pyrite has been proposed to be served as an index to identify hydrothermal venting in the McArthur River deposit (Williams, 1978a; Maier, 2011; Mukherjee and Large, 2017; Spinks et al., 2020). Two generations of fine-grained pyrites (diagenetic py1 and hydrothermal py2) were identified in the McArthur River deposit (Williams, 1978a). Trace elements including Cu (Williams, 1978a), Pb (Magnall et al., 2020c) and Tl (Spinks et al., 2020), likely derived from hydrothermal fluids, are mainly concentrated in hydrothermal py2. While fine-grained pyrites in the deposit have different trace element systematics compared to those in non-mineralized sediments. Maier (2011) reported that pyrite grains in the McArthur River deposit have higher concentrations of Tl and lower concentrations of Ni compared to those of grains from distal regions (\u223c23\u00a0km away). Mukherjee and Large (2017) also identified that pyrite grains adjacent to the mineralization zone (\u223c20\u00a0km away) are more enriched in Pb and Zn but depleted in Co compared to pyrites distal (\u223c60\u00a0km away) from the McArthur River ore deposit. It was interpreted that Ni and Co in distal shales were predominantly derived from seawater, whereas Pb, Tl, and Zn in ore deposits were mainly contributed by hydrothermal fluids (Mukherjee and Large, 2017). However, up to now, hydrothermal fine-grained pyrite in distal regions has not been documented yet.\nThe laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) technique has been applied to quantify trace element concentrations and to map elemental distributions in pyrite grains distal and proximal to the McArthur River deposit in previous studies (Maier, 2011; Mukherjee and Large, 2017). However, this technique has limited spatial resolution, which can only measure pyrite grains>10\u00a0\u03bcm (Mukherjee and Large, 2017). Fine-grained pyrites interbedded with organic-rich, fine-grained silt and clay in the BCF are commonly<10\u00a0\u03bcm that is smaller than the detection limit of LA-ICP-MS, and therefore the features of fine-grained pyrite are not well constrained. The trace element distribution patterns of fine-grained pyrites may preserve significant information for understanding the ore-forming process and spatial scale of the hydrothermal event. A recent study based on nanoscale trace element mapping of pyrites from the McArthur River deposit using FIB-TOF-SIMS (Focused ion beam-time of flight-secondary ionization mass spectrometry) found that Tl enrichment mainly occurs in hydrothermal py2, which was previously neglected (Spinks et al., 2020). Their findings highlighted the robust potential of using nanoscale analytical techniques for pyrite trace element mapping to unravel details of hydrothermal processes.\nOur study utilised a novel combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (Nano-SIMS), and Raman spectroscopy to investigate geochemical features of fine-grained pyrite and spatially-associated solid bitumen from the non-mineralized BCF intersected by the drill-hole Lamont Pass 3, which is situated between the McArthur River deposit and the depocenter of the Glyde sub-basin (Fig. 1A). Nano-SIMS was utilized in this study to characterize the distribution of so-called \u201cseawater-derived\u201d elements (Ni, Co), \u201chydrothermal-derived\u201d elements (Pb, Zn, Tl), and other redox-sensitive elements (V, Cu) between pyrites, bitumen and surrounding silicates. Raman spectroscopy was applied to constrain the thermal imprint levels of solid bitumen and potential temperature estimate of hydrothermal fluids, to understand the formation process of solid bitumen and its possible links with the pyrite precipitation.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThe McArthur Basin is an ancient intracontinental basin located in northern Australia (Fig. 1A), which mainly comprises Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks (Jackson et al., 1987; Rawlings, 1999). The Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are classified into four groups (Fig. 1B), including the Tawallah (1.8\u20131.7\u00a0Ga), McArthur (1.7\u20131.6\u00a0Ga), Nathan (\u223c1.6\u00a0Ga), and Roper (1.4\u20131.6\u00a0Ga) groups. The Tawallah Group is the oldest sequence, which mainly consists of quartz sandstones that are interbedded with mafic volcanic rocks, fine-grained siltstones, mudstones, and carbonate rocks (Spinks et al., 2016). The McArthur Group overlies the Tawallah Group and is a sequence of interbedded carbonate rocks, mudstones, sandstones, and talus breccias (Kunzmann et al., 2019). The Nathan Group overlies the McArthur Group and primarily comprises dolomite and sandstone lithologies (Jackson and Southgate, 2000). The Roper Group is the youngest Mesoproterozoic sequence in the McArthur Basin and it largely consists of quartz sandstones, siltstones and shales (Jackson et al., 1986, 1987).\nThe 1.64\u00a0Ga Barney Creek Formation (BCF) is a sequence of fine-grained sedimentary rock within the McArthur Group, which was deposited in a north\u2013south trending basin (Jackson et al., 1987; Bull, 1998). The BCF is sandwiched between the overlying Reward Dolostone and the underlying Coxco Dolostone Members (Fig. 1B; Rawlings, 1999; Lindsay, 2001). Three members are further divided for the BCF, including the W-Fold Shale Member, the HYC Pyritic Shale Member, and Upper Barney Creek Formation (Kunzmann et al., 2018, 2019). The W-Fold Shale Member mainly consists of green and red dolomitic siltstone or pink dololutite with interbedded tuff; the HYC Pyritic Shale Member contains carbonaceous, dolomitic and pyritic siltstone and shale; and the Upper Barney Creek Formation is a thinly bedded or planar laminated, dolomitic, carbonaceous and pyritic siltstone and shale sequence (Davidson and Dashlooty, 1993; Bull, 1998).\nSedimentary facies and thickness vary significantly in the BCF, which are the result of syn-tectonic sedimentation (Kunzmann et al., 2019). Thickness of the BCF in the McArthur Basin ranges from less 10\u00a0m to over 900\u00a0m (Ahmad et al., 2013). The BCF was deposited mostly in deep subtidal to slope environments, and partially in shoaling to shallow subtidal environments (Kunzmann et al., 2019). Multiple lithofacies occurred in the BCF, such as sabkha conglomerate, bedded dolarenite (shallow subtidal to supratidal), microbialaminite (low-energy intertidal to lower supratidal), dololutite (shallow subtidal to lower supratidal, sediment-gravity flows), interbedded dolarenite with red\/green\/brown siltstone laminae (shallow subtidal to lower intertidal), stromatolite (shallow subtidal to intertidal), dolomudstone (quiet subtidal), interbedded dolarenite with grey siltstone (sediment gravity flows), silty dolarenite\/dolomitic siltstone (near storm wave base, hemipelagic\/low-density turbidity currents), mass-flow breccia (below storm wave base, hemipelagic\/low-density turbidity currents), and rhythmite (below storm wave base in slope environments, pelagic and hemipelagic fallout and dilute turbidity currents) (Kunzmann et al., 2019).\nThe giant McArthur River ore deposit contained a pre-mining resource of\u00a0\u223c227 Mt of Pb+Zn metal (9.25% Zn and 4.1% Pb; Large et al., 2005). Oxidized, SO4\n2--dominated, acidic to near-neutral fluids were responsible for the formation of the McArthur River deposit (Cooke et al., 2000; Spinks et al., 2020). Temperatures of the fluids are relatively low (<200 \u2103) as suggested by the common occurrence of siderite\/ferroan carbonate halo associated with the deposit (Cooke et al., 2000). This was consistent with the temperatures estimated based on fluid-rock interaction modelling (50\u2013120 \u2103; Large et al., 2001), S isotopic study (100\u2013150 \u2103; Ireland et al., 2004) and thermal maturity of kerogen in the BCF (100\u2013180 \u2103; Vinnichenko et al., 2021).\nFine-grained pyrite is a significant medium for understanding the ore-forming process of the McArthur River deposit (Large et al., 2005). Several types of sulphides are identified in the McArthur River deposit, including two stages of fine-grained pyrites (py1, py2), two stages of sphalerite (sp1, sp2), galena, chalcopyrite, and arsenopyrite (Croxford and Jephcott, 1972; Williams and Rye, 1974; Lambert, 1976; Williams, 1978a, b; Eldridge et al., 1993; Large and McGoldrick, 1998). Ireland et al. (2004) suggested that two stages of sphalerite mineralisation occurred before the formation of sedimentary py1 and diagenetic py2, respectively. This paragenesis model indicates that both syndepositional mineralization and diagenetic replacement accounts for the occurrence of the McArthur River deposit. Whereas, a recent study argued that the sphalerite mineralisation occurred perhaps immediately after the Tl mineralisation in later-stage pyritic overgrowths (Spinks et al., 2020). This epigenetic mineralisation process was accompanied by the dissolution of laminated\/nodular dolomite and re-precipitation of Mn-bearing dolomite (Spinks et al., 2020). The epigenetic mineralisation model was also supported by paleomagnetic data (Symons, 2007) and structural analysis (Lindsay, 2001).\nLamont Pass 3 (16.7612\u00b0 S, 136.2305\u00b0 E, Fig. 1A) is a vertical drill-hole nearby the Emu Fault situated between the McArthur River deposit and the depocenter of Glyde sub-basin (Fig. 1A). It was implemented in 2013 by an oil company (Armour Energy) and penetrated 218\u00a0m of the non-mineralized BCF (649\u2013867\u00a0m). The BCF intersected by this drill-hole mainly consists of shoal to shallow subtidal facies with small portions of bituminous dolomitic siltstone (Kunzmann et al., 2019). Therefore, the trace element systematics of fine-grained pyrites from the BCF of the Lamont Pass 3, combined with previous studies, show the great potential of providing robust evidence for the argument whether or not there was a widespread Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system along the Emu Fault in the southern McArthur Basin.\n\n\n3\nSamples and methods\nFour samples were taken from the BCF intersected by the drill-hole Lamont Pass 3 in the depth range of 708\u2013803\u00a0m (Fig. 1B), and thin sections of 30\u00a0\u03bcm thick were prepared for in-situ analysis.\nThe Lamont Pass 3 went through the non-mineralized BCF of multiple lithofacies, including dolomudstone, bedded dolarenite, mass-flow breccia, dolomudstone, dolarenite, rhythmite, and dolomitic siltstone, which were thought to have been deposited in shallow subtidal to deep subtidal\/slope environments (Kunzmann et al., 2018). Samples investigated in this study were taken from subtidal dolomudstone (LP1), deep subtidal\/slope rhythmite (LP2) and dolomitic siltstone (LP3, LP4) intervals. Laminated structure commonly occurs in the studied samples. Thinly laminated structure occurs in the sample LP1 (Fig. 2\nA). Disseminated fine-grained pyrites occur within laminae where solid bitumen commonly appears (Fig. 2A). In the sample LP2, fine-grained pyrites can be dispersed in the matrix, co-occur with solid bitumen-bearing laminae or form as parallel bands (Fig. 2B). In the sample LP3 (Fig. 2C), besides the common occurrence of pyrite-solid-bitumen laminae, carbonate veinlets also occasionally appear in the thin sections, which are potential results of hydrothermal infiltration. Fine-grained pyrite in the sample LP3 can be dispersed in the matrix, form as clusters or occur either with solid bitumen-bearing laminae or along with the carbonate veinlet. In the sample LP4, fine-grained pyrites are commonly dispersed within the matrix (Fig. 2D). A recent study identified two transgressive\u2013regressive sequences in this section (B1 and B2) (Kunzmann et al., 2018): sample LP1 comes from the transgressive systems tract (TST) of the B1; sample LP2 comes from the regressive systems tract (TST) of the B2; samples LP3 and LP4 come from the TST of the B2. Stereo binocular microscopy and scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) at Curtin University were employed to investigate the mineralogy and paragenesis of the sample.\n\n3.1\nOrganic petrography and reflectance measurements\nOrganic petrography was conducted with a Leica MD6000 M microscope equipped with Diskus-Fossil system at the University of Queensland. The reflectance measurements of the organic matter dispersed in sediments occurring in the samples followed the recommendations of the ASTM D7708 (2015) standard. Random reflectance measurements were conducted under reflected light (\u03bb=546\u00a0nm) using a fixed microscope stage with an oil immersion objective of 50x and an ultra-fine pixel size (0.3\u00a0\u03bcm) probe. The microscope was calibrated with 2 standards, a YAG standard (0.908 %) and a black standard (0.0 %). Fluorescent light excitation was also used to assist in the identification of properties of the organic components.\n\n\n3.2\nRaman spectroscopy of solid bitumen\nRaman spectroscopic signatures of pyrite-spatially-associated solid bitumen were determined using a Horiba\u00ae LabRAMHR Evolution equipped with a 600 gr\/mm grating and a Synapse visible detector at the Australian Resources Research Centre in Perth, Australia. The 532\u00a0nm incident radiation was generated by a 100 mW Laser Quantum Torus consisting of a continuous wave single frequency diode laser. Perpendicular to the thin section, the laser beam was focused to a\u00a0\u223c0.72\u00a0\u03bcm width with a 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0objective, and numeric aperture of the objective was 0.90. Laser Power was decreased to\u00a0\u223c0.3 mW on the sample surface by filters.\nRaman spectral data were collected in the wavelength interval of 700\u20134000\u00a0cm\u22121 as typical peaks of organic matter appear in 1100\u20131800\u00a0cm\u22121 (\u201cfirst-order region\u201d) and 2500\u20133100\u00a0cm\u22121 (\u201csecond-order region\u201d) (Wopenka and Pasteris, 1993; Beyssac et al., 2002, 2003; Pasteris and Wopenka, 2003; Yui et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2015). Data reduction of Raman spectral signals used a commercial software \u201cMagicPlot\u201d (Magicplot Systems LLC, Saint Petersburg, Russia). A baseline was fitted by creating a spline for raw data of each analysis to eliminate the interference of background noise. Peak positions were identified by deconvoluting the baseline-fitted spectrum into Gaussian and Lorentzian curves (Fig. 10A-D). The spectral curves were deconvoluted into peaks including D1 peak (1330\u20131350\u00a0cm\u22121), G low peak (1590\u20131600\u00a0cm\u22121; a combination of D2 and G peaks in Kouketsu et al. (2014)\u2019s study), D3 peak (1470\u20131550\u00a0cm\u22121), and D4 peak (1240\u20131270\u00a0cm\u22121) according to Kouketsu et al. (2014).\nGeothermometers have been developed from the Raman parameters to infer the temperature of organic matter. In this study, the presence of disordered bands in the samples indicates a low-temperature condition, thus, a thermometer proposed by Kouketsu et al. (2014) is applied to the bitumen in BCF:.\n\n(1)\n\n\nT\n\n(\n\n\no\n\nC\n)\n\n=\n-\n6.78\n\u00d7\n\nW\n\nG\n\nlow\n\n\n+\n535\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere W represents the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of corresponding spectral peaks. T(\u2103) represents the temperature estimated by the spectral data (Kouketsu et al., 2014).\n\n\n3.3\nNanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (Nano-SIMS)\nNanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) analyses were performed with a CAMECA NanoSIMS 50L at the Centre for Microscopy, Characterization and Analysis(CMCA), at the University of Western Australia. Sample mounts were coated with 10\u00a0nm of gold to provide conductivity. A Hyperion (H200) RF-plasma O-\nsource was used for all analyses. The primary current was 100 pA and the impact energy was 16\u00a0keV.The instrument was operated in the multi-collection mode, allowing the simultaneous detection of seven ions\/elements. Ten elements were investigated including Fe, Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, V, Mg and K. Secondary ion images were obtained by rastering the primaryion beam over areas measuring50\u201360\u00a0\u03bcm2, at a resolution of 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 pixels and with dwell times of 20\u00a0ms per pixel. Image processing was carried out with the ImageJ plugin OpenMIMS.\n\n\n\n4\nAnalytical results\n\n4.1\nPyrite petrography\nPetrographic examining shows that the BCF samples analysed in this study display similar mineralogical compositions. The matrix is mainly composed of silicate minerals (e.g. clays, quartz), sulphides, and carbonates (Fig. 2). Pyrite grains always co-exist with solid bitumen, which form thin dark veinlets parallel to the bedding under optical reflected light (Fig. 2A, 2B, 2D). The veinlets sometimes are cross-cut by carbonate veins (Fig. 2A).\nThe close spatial relation between pyrites and solid bitumen is unrevealed in both optical and SEM images (Fig. 3\nA-3D and Fig. 4\nA-4D). In detail, those pyrites are generally fine-grained (<10\u00a0\u03bcm) and exhibit variable morphologies, such as elongated crystals (Fig. 3A), ultrafine-grained microcrystals (<2 \u03bcm; Fig. 3A), and sub-rounded crystals (>2 \u03bcm; Fig. 3B-3D). The elongated pyrites display widths of less than 1\u00a0\u03bcm and length between 5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 3A), occurring as clusters or overgrows sub-round pyrite (Fig. 5\nA). The ultrafine-grained pyrite microcrystals form exclusively as clusters (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the sub-rounded pyrites, with sizes of>2\u00a0\u03bcm, are disseminated within the matrix (Fig. 3A) or occur as packed clusters that are distributed along with the bedding (Fig. 3C-3D).\n\n\n4.2\nNanoscale trace element chemistry\nTrace elements present distinct spatial distribution patterns in various pyrites (sub-rounded, elongated, and ultrafine-grained) and matrix, which will be described in detail below. The characteristics of trace element distribution are also summarized in Table 1\n. Nano-SIMS mapping of Fe shows the distribution of pyrites in the characteristic regions of samples, which is used for calibrating mapping results of other elements (Figs. 5-9 and S1-S6\n\n\n\n\n, elements are labelled appropriately).\n\n4.2.1\nSub-rounded pyrites\nSub-rounded pyrite grains generally have a core-rim structure with heterogeneous distribution patterns of Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu (Figs. 5-7), where trace elements are relatively enriched in the rim, and depleted in the core regions. Radial trace element-enriched (Pb, Tl, Ni, Co) bands are also observed in the pyritic core (Fig. 5C-5F and 6C-6F). In contrast to Pb, Ni, and Cu, weak signals of Tl and Cu are also present in the core regions (Figs. 5-7).\n\n\n4.2.2\nElongated pyrites and ultrafine-grained microcrystals\nElongated pyrites and ultrafine-grained microcrystals are enriched in Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu, although there are some heterogeneities between individual crystals with respect to the distribution of these trace elements (Figs. 8-9). In contrast to trace elements of Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu, other trace elements including Zn and V are concentrated in the matrix with similar distribution patterns to Mg and K (Figs. 5-9 and S1-S6). In addition to being concentrated in pyrites, Cu is also relatively enriched in the matrix (Figs. 5-9 and S1-S6).\n\n\n\n4.3\nOrganic matter characterization\nThe reflectance of the solid bitumen (SBRr%) in the rock matrix of sample LP1 have an averaged value of 0.8% (n=176, measured points), with a fluorescence from dull orange to brown. The conversion formula to vitrinite reflectance equivalent (VReq%) from Schmidt et al. (2019), VReq%= [(SBRr%*0.938)\u00a0+\u00a00.3145], gives a value of 1.1%. By applying the temperature formula for hydrothermal systems from Barker and Pawlewicz (1994) (T=(ln(VReq)\u00a0+\u00a01.19)\/0.00782), the solid bitumen in the matrix indicated temperatures around 164 \u2070C. In LP3 and LP4 samples, the solid bitumen has very low fluorescence (brown colour). The reflectance values measured were 1% for LP3 and 1.1 for LP4, which correspond to a vitrinite equivalent reflectance of 1.25% VReq and 1.35% VReq, respectively. Using the VReq as a geothermometer indicator, the temperatures attained were 180 \u2070C in LP3 and 190 \u2070C in LP4 (Table 2\n).\nSolid bitumen in four BCF samples shares similar Raman spectral characteristics (Fig. 10). Positions (cm\u22121), full width at half maximum (FWHM), intensity and integration area of typical Raman spectral bands for solid bitumen in the studied samples are listed in the supplementary file (Table S1). Spectral bands including D1, G low, D3 and D4 were identified in the first-order region of Raman spectral data for solid bitumen in this study. The bands D1 and G low occur at 1333\u20131348\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1590\u20131597\u00a0cm\u22121 on the Raman spectrum, respectively. The D3 band occurs at 1472\u20131544\u00a0cm\u22121 on the spectrum, and is the result of out-of-plane vibration due to defects and heteroatoms (Wopenka and Pasteris, 1993; Beyssac et al., 2002). The D4 band occurs at 1242\u20131270\u00a0cm\u22121 on the spectrum, which is the result of vibration of polyene-like structures in the organic matter (Hu et al., 2015). The temperature range derived from the equation of Kouketsu et al. (2014) is between 168 \u2103 and 179 \u2103 (Table 2).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nEnrichment of trace element in fine-grained pyrites\nFine-grained pyrites in the BCF of the Lamont Pass 3 can be classified into two groups according to nanoscale trace element distribution patterns: (1) pyrites show relative enrichment of Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu; and (2) pyrites display relative depletion of these trace elements. The most prominent feature is that trace element-rich fine-grained pyrites overgrow trace element-depleted sub-rounded pyrites (Figs. 5-7). The enrichment of Pb, Tl, Co, and Cu in the rim relative to the core (Figs. 5-7) indicates a two-stage pyrite precipitation process. Trace element-enriched veinlets occur along with fractures into the cores of the sub-rounded grains (Fig. 6C, 6E-6G), also supporting the later-stage occurrence of metal-rich fluids. Elongated pyrites and ultrafine-grained microcrystals also contain elevated contents of the same set of trace elements compared to the surrounding matrix (Figs. 8-9). The consistent trace element enrichment in the overgrown, elongated, and ultrafine-grained pyrites strongly indicates that they precipitated from fluids with similar trace elemental compositions.\nIt has been demonstrated that the feature of trace element in pyrite grains is inherited from hydrothermal fluid, where pyrites are precipitated from, and, therefore, the trace element characteristics of pyrite are therefore useful proxies to constrain physical\/chemical properties of fluids (e.g. chemical compositions, temperature) (Huerta-Diaz and Morse, 1992; Morse and Luther, 1999; Large et al., 2009; Gregory et al., 2015; Keith et al., 2016; Mukherjee and Large, 2017; Spinks et al., 2020). Trace elements can be present in the lattice of pyrite structure, or occur as nano-inclusions, or a combination of both occurrence (Berner et al., 2013; Large et al., 2014). Lead can be easily incorporated into the lattice structure of pyrite at various oxidation conditions (Gregory et al., 2015) or as galena nano-inclusions (Cabral et al., 2011). Thallium has been suggested to exhibit chalcophile behaviour in hydrothermal fluids (McGoldrick et al., 1979) and has been found to be enriched in hydrothermal pyrites in the McArthur River deposit (Spinks et al., 2020). Trace elements of Ni and Co are commonly lattice bound within pyrite (Vaughan and Rosso, 2006). Copper is either bound with crystal lattice or occur as nano-inclusions (Williams, 1978a). Different trace elements have been suggested to exhibit different partitioning behaviour during pyrite precipitation (Morse and Luther, 1999), yet the consistent zonation patterns of Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu in our observations suggest that such differences may not be the dominant factor influencing their distributions in pyrites. Fine-grained pyrites are also observed to overgrow trace element-depleted sub-rounded pyrites (Fig. 5A-5G), providing the direct evidence that the trace element enrichment in pyritic overgrowth was likely mainly resulted from fluid flows. Trace elements of Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu are heterogeneous in different pyrite grains. As shown in the Figs. 8-9, several grains contain higher trace element concentrations relative to others within the same cluster. This may be attributed to the various degrees of interaction of hydrothermal fluid with the complex organic-pyritic-carbonate BCF host rocks deposited in the studied area (Kunzmann et al., 2018). In contrast to the above mentioned trace elements, others including Zn, Mg and V are not concentrated in fine-grained pyrites but enriched in matrix (Figs. 5-9), which may have been accumulated at the time of the deposition of sediments (Rimmer, 2004).\nTwo generations of fine-grained pyrites were also identified in the McArthur River deposit (Williams, 1978a), and the later-stage hydrothermal pyrites (py2) have been reported to be enriched in trace elements such as Cu (Williams, 1978a), Pb (Magnall et al., 2020c), and Tl (Spinks et al., 2020) compared to diagenetic py1 grains (Table 3\n). Therefore, it is most likely that trace element-depleted and -enriched pyrites in this study correspond to diagenetic (py1) and hydrothermal (py2) pyrites in the McArthur River deposit, respectively. Although the direct evidence of Ni-Co-enriched hydrothermal pyritic overgrowths surrounding the diagenetic pyrites is not reported yet in the McArthur River deposit, several lines of geological and geochemical evidence suggest that these trace elements were enriched in the hydrothermal fluids. Hydrothermal pyrite with the enrichments of Ni and Co was proposed as a good indicator of hydrothermal fluids which have migrated through mafic rocks (Gregory et al., 2015). Previous studies have suggested that mafic rocks within the Tawallah Group are distributed beneath the McArthur River deposit and are the dominant metal sources for the deposit (e.g. Leaman, 1998; Blaikie and Kunzmann, 2020), thus the fluids responsible for the deposit should have contained appreciable concentrations of Ni and Co. Additionally, although Zn is another abundant metal in the mineralizing fluids, it is not detected in pyritic overgrowth in the studied non-mineralized samples, which may suggest that Zn was deposited in mineralization regions before reaching the studied area (e.g. Large et al., 2000; Ahmad et al., 2013).\nPyrites in the non-mineralized BCF display largely variable trace element concentrations, with Pb ranging from 18 to 12670\u00a0ppm, Tl ranging from 0.06 to 174\u00a0ppm, Ni ranging from 13 to 18230\u00a0ppm, Co ranging from 4 to 4589\u00a0ppm, and Cu ranging from 17 to 4727\u00a0ppm as reported by Mukherjee and Large (2017). Maier (2011) also reported that pyrites in the BCF contain 11\u2013577\u00a0ppm Tl, 77\u2013340\u00a0ppm Ni, 63\u2013190\u00a0ppm Co, and 133\u2013332\u00a0ppm Cu. These are useful for understanding the nature of trace element enrichment in pyrites in the non-mineralized BCF. However, those studies mainly focused on bulk trace element compositions of individual grains with size>10\u00a0\u03bcm and were not able to characterize trace element zonation in fine-grained pyrites due to the limited spatial resolution of the technique adopted in their studies (LA-ICP-MS). It is possible that there is an unrecognized zonation pattern for fine-grained pyrite in their studies, which may contribute to the elevated trace element concentrations in pyrites. In this study, although fine-grained pyrites in the non-mineralized BCF have homogeneous structures under the optical microscope, which are similar to those reported by previous studies (Maier, 2011; Mukherjee and Large, 2017), Nano-SIMS analysis shows zonation of Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu (Figs. 5-7). Such trace element paragenetic distribution patterns suggest that hydrothermal overgrowths may contribute significantly to the trace element repository of fine-grained pyrites in the non-mineralized BCF.\n\n\n5.2\nHigh-temperature solid bitumen: Indicator of hydrothermal fluid flow in the Lamont Pass 3\nSolid bitumen is closely spatially-associated with fine-grained pyrite in the studied samples and can either occupy pore spaces nearby pyrites or closely contact with or envelope pyrite grains (Fig. 3A-3D). Optical photomicrographs show that solid bitumen mostly directly contacts the trace element-rich hydrothermal pyrites but is not commonly with trace element-depleted diagenetic pyrites (Figs. 5-9). Such distribution patterns indicate that solid bitumen was likely formed contemporaneously with hydrothermal infiltration, yet it cannot be precluded that solid bitumen originally occupied pore spaces in diagenetic settings and were thermally-reworked afterwards. It is important to determine the formation temperature of solid bitumen for understanding the paragenetic sequence of solid bitumen and the spatially-associated pyrite.\nFormation temperature of solid bitumen can be estimated by Raman spectra data (Wopenka and Pasteris, 1993; Beyssac et al., 2002, 2003; Yui et al., 2010; Kouketsu et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015). Regardless of different forms of occurrence, solid bitumen in the BCF intersected by the drill-hole Lamont Pass 3 (in the depth range of 708\u2013803\u00a0m) have similar Raman spectral characteristics (Fig. 10A-10D), suggesting that they have similar maturity levels and have undergone similar thermal conditions. To quantitatively constrain the formation temperature of solid bitumen, an empirical temperature estimate equation established by Kouketsu et al. (2014) was utilized (Eq. 1), which suits a temperature range of 150\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C, according to the linear correlation between the FWHM values and peak temperatures (Kouketsu et al., 2014). The calculated temperatures of solid bitumen in the BCF samples range from 168\u00a0\u00b0C to 179\u00a0\u00b0C (average is 174\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C), which are consistent with temperatures determined from the bitumen reflectance values (164 to 190\u00a0\u00b0C, average is 178\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0\u00b0C; Table 2).\nTemperatures obtained in this study approximate the temperature of hydrothermal fluids for the McArthur River deposit (Ireland et al., 2004; Vinnichenko et al., 2021). Reflectance data of solid bitumen can provide an additional support for the hydrothermal influence on maturity levels of solid bitumen. The studied drill-hole is located on the Lamont Pass paleohigh, adjacent to the Glyde sub-basin (Fig. 1A), whereas VReq values of the studies samples (1.1\u20131.35%) are higher than those from the BCF at similar burial depths in the depocenter of the sub-basin (<1%; Crick et al., 1988). This indicates that burial is not the only factor affecting thermal maturation of solid bitumen. Recently, Rodrigues et al. (2015) identified two groups of solid bitumen with distinct vertical VReq distribution patterns in the depocenter of the Glyde sub-basin. One group shows an normal burial-induced increasing trend with VReq ranging from 0.76% to 0.86%, whereas the other group shows an erratic pattern (0.78\u20131.24%), which is a common characteristics for the hydrothermally-influenced profile (Glikson, 2001). VReq values of hydrothermally-imprinted solid bitumen in this study are similar to those of solid bitumen from Rodrigues et al. (2015)\u2019s study with values of 0.78\u20131.24%.\n\n\n5.3\nGenesis of fine-grained pyrite in Lamont Pass 3\nHigh-temperatures unravelled by the Raman spectral and reflectance analysis of solid bitumen, combined with trace element-zoning of fine-grained pyrites, support a hydrothermal process for the precipitation of later-stage pyrites. There may be multiple interpretations of the genesis of trace element-rich later-stage pyrites. Hydrothermally-facilitated thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR) is a possible process responsible for the precipitation of later-stage pyrites if solid bitumen was formed contemporaneously, because formation temperatures of solid bitumen approximate to the temperature that is necessary for the occurrence of TSR (Machel, 2001). In another scenario, solid bitumen may have not precipitated contemporaneously with the later-stage pyrites. Instead, solid bitumen may be a maturation product of sedimentary organic matter coexisting with diagenetic pyrites. Solid bitumen remained intergrown with pyrites but may have not been involved in pyrite precipitation during hydrothermal infiltration. The maturation of organic materials was likely facilitated by both burial and hydrothermal fluids.\nThis study integrated Nano-SIMS, Raman spectral, and reflectance analysis to identify two generations of fine-grained pyrites in the BCF of Lamont Pass 3 and the formation of later-stage pyrites involved hydrothermal processes. It has been suggested by previous studies that reduced S of fine-grained pyrites associated with the Pb-Zn deposits was likely directly obtained via microbial sulphate reduction (MSR) (Magnall et al., 2016, 2020a, b; Rieger et al., 2020). MSR generally occurs under low temperature conditions in diagenetic settings (below 80\u00a0\u00b0C). Thus, the early-stage diagenetic pyrites may have precipitated directly from MSR. In contrast, reduced S of the later-stage hydrothermally-originated pyrites may have not been directly obtained via MSR because of the higher formation temperatures of hydrothermal pyrites. Therefore, we proposed that hydrothermal fluids may have dissolved H2S\/diagenetic pyrites which have been formed by the early-stage MSR, and further resulted in the precipitation of trace element-rich fine-grained pyrites. This can be similar to the dissolution\/precipitation of pyrites observed in hydrothermal deposits in previous studies (Xing et al., 2019; Bonnetti et al., 2020). However, further studies are necessary to be conducted to test the hypothesis.\n\n\n5.4\nA widespread Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system in the southern McArthur basin\nThe presence of hydrothermal fluid flow identified in the Lamont Pass 3 section is likely the far-field effect of the McArthur River mineralisation, as evidenced by the consistent trace element compositions and temperatures of fluids in these two regions. Pyrite Nano-SIMS mapping results show that hydrothermal fluids affecting the Lamont Pass 3 section enriched in Pb, Tl, Cu, Ni and Co. These trace elements are also enriched in fluids responsible for the McArthur River deposit (Williams, 1978a; Ahmad et al., 2013; Blaikie and Kunzmann, 2020; Spinks et al., 2020). Raman and reflectance analyses of solid bitumen indicate those temperatures of the fluids in the Lamont Pass 3 section approximate the fluid temperature for the McArthur River deposit. These similarities indicate that hydrothermal flows in the Lamont Pass 3 section were likely the same fluids for the McArthur River deposit. Solid bitumen may have played a key role in facilitating precipitation of hydrothermal pyrites because it may incorporate chalcophile trace elements from the fluid, although further studies are required to test its detailed roles.\nOutcomes of this study, combined with previous studies, suggest that a widespread Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system may have occurred along the Emu Fault in the southern McArthur Basin. The spatial scale of hydrothermal alteration related to the McArthur River deposit has been characterised by various chemical and mineralogical indexes. Along with the trends perpendicular to the Emu Fault, ore-related metal halos, including Zn (>1000\u00a0ppm), Pb (>100\u00a0ppm) and Tl (>4 ppm), were observed in the region 15\u00a0km southwest of the deposit (Large et al., 2000). Hydrothermal fluid activity was also documented in the regions 23\u00a0km southwest of the deposit based on MnO, Fe\/Mg, and C-O isotopic anomalies (Large et al., 2000, 2001). However, evidence of the presence of hydrothermal fluids was not identified in a locality (drill-hole MBXDD001) 60\u00a0km southwest of the McArthur River deposit (Mukherjee and Large, 2017). Compared to the trends perpendicular to the Emu Fault, the influence of hydrothermal activities along with the Emu Fault may extend to more distal regions. For example, outcomes of this study showed lines of evidence for the presence of hydrothermal fluid flow in the Lamont Pass 3 section, which is located approximately 50\u00a0km away the McArthur River deposit. Rodrigues et al. (2015) identified a hydrothermally-disturbed BCF profile in the depocenter of Glyde sub-basin, which is about 100\u00a0km away the McArthur River deposit. Because the Lamont Pass 3 section, Glyde sub-basin, and McArthur River deposit are all located nearby the Emu Fault (Fig. 1A), thus the Emu Fault may have been the predominant fluid conduit for the large-scale Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal activity in the southern McArthur Basin. In a similar vein, Glikson et al. (2006) and Golding et al. (2006) showed that the Termite Range Fault in the Proterozoic Lawn Hill Platform of northern Australia was a conduit for hydrothermal fluids involved in the formation of base metal deposits in the Burketown Mineral Field including the giant Century Zn deposit. This implies that the major fluid migration pathway (e.g. active faults) may determine the spatial scale of hydrothermal influence in this region, and is likely one of the most important factors controlling the distribution of base metal deposits in the southern McArthur Basin and elsewhere in the Proterozoic of northern Australia.\nThis study showed that hydrothermal fluid flows in the Lamont Pass 3 section has not resulted in ore grade mineralisation but rather slight enrichment of trace element in the later-stage pyritic overgrowths. The non-mineralization of the BCF in the Lamont Pass 3 may be attributed to (1) insufficient metal supply, (2) the lack of carbonate buffer, 3) unsuitable pH\/redox conditions of hydrothermal fluids, and\/or (4) lack of secondary faults. Mafic igneous rocks within the Tawallah Group are considered as significant metal sources for the McArthur River deposit (Leaman, 1998; Blaikie and Kunzmann, 2020). Subsurface mafic rocks are mainly situated in close proximity to the McArthur River-Teena deposits, but are not documented in the Lamont Pass 3 section or Glyde sub-basin (Blaikie and Kunzmann, 2020). Thus, there may have been insufficient supply of ore-related metals (e.g. Pb and Zn) for mineralisation in these two regions. The carbonate dissolution is a significant process to cause pH buffering, which resulted in the mineralisation of the McArthur River deposit (Spinks et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Compared with the McArthur River deposit, laminated\/nodular carbonates do not commonly occur in the Lamont Pass 3 section (Kunzmann et al., 2019), and a favourable pH condition for metal deposition may have not been created as well. Thermodynamic calculation results show that metal-dissolving capacity of hydrothermal fluids is significantly influenced by pH and oxygen fugacity of the fluid (Spinks et al., 2020). We thus proposed that redox\/pH conditions of hydrothermal fluids occurred in the Lamont Pass 3 section may not have capacity to transport high concentrations of metals. In addition, compared to the mineralization regions, there lacks secondary faults in the studied area (Blaikie and Kunzmann, 2020), which may have reduced the local fluid circulation and enrichment of ore metals as active faults may enhance the permeability of strata in the basin (Yang et al., 2004).\nInstead of discovering ore deposits, recent exploration work demonstrates significant hydrocarbon potential of the Lamont Pass 3 section and Glyde sub-basin (Munson, 2014). A number of oil\/gas shows were identified in the BCF of the Lamont Pass 3 section (Munson, 2014). Further in the depocenter of Glyde sub-basin, there is a natural gas field with gas mainly generated by the BCF (\u201cGlyde gas prospect\u201d), which is the only site to date with gas flows of economic significance in the McArthur Group in the southern McArthur Basin (Munson, 2014). This may suggest that hydrothermal infiltration was not enough intense to oxidize generated hydrocarbons, but rather facilitated hydrocarbon accumulations in these regions (e.g. heat supplement for maturation of organic materials). Therefore, the intensity of hydrothermal flows may have exhibited a decreasing trend along the Emu Fault, from the McArthur River-Teena regions to the Lamont Pass Palaeohigh and Glyde sub-basin. Besides, hydrocarbon generation occurred after the deposition of BCF in these regions (Crick et al., 1988). Thus, if hydrothermal fluids responsible for the McArthur River deposit have facilitated hydrocarbon generation in the Lamont Pass Palaeohigh and Glyde sub-basin, an epigenetic mineralisation model would be favoured for the deposit.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe Paleoproterozoic hydrothermal system in the McArthur Basin, northern Australia, played a key role in the formation of the world-class, CD-type McArthur River Zn-Pb deposit. It is important to depict the spatial scale of such a hydrothermal system to improve the current mineral exploration approaches in this region. In this study, we integrated Nano-SIMS and Raman spectral techniques to investigate the nature of trace element composition of fine-grained pyrites and thermal maturity of spatially-associated solid bitumen in the non-mineralized BCF intersected by the drill-hole Lamont Pass 3. Outcomes of this study unravelled the lines of evidence of hydrothermal fluid flow in the studied area, which potentially links with the approximately 50\u00a0km away McArthur River deposit. Combining with previous studies in the McArthur River deposit, this study identified two generations of fine-grained pyrites: diagenetic and hydrothermal pyrites. The two generations of pyrites have distinctive nanoscale trace element distribution patterns that Pb, Tl, Ni, Co, and Cu are enriched in hydrothermal pyritic overgrowths but depleted in diagenetic pyritic cores. The formation temperatures of solid bitumen were estimated to be around 170 \u2103 based on Raman spectral and reflectance data, approximating the temperature of hydrothermal fluids responsible for the McArthur River deposit. Solid bitumen may be formed syngenetically with diagenetic pyrites and thermally reworked by hydrothermal fluids, or occurred contemporaneously with hydrothermal pyrite. Thus, Nano-SIMS and Raman spectral analytical results demonstrate a potential widespread hydrothermal fluid flow event associated with the McArthur River deposit, which likely extended to as far as the Lamont Pass 3 section along with the Emu Fault.\n\n","31":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAs an important type of gold deposits, the orogenic Au deposits offer\u00a0>\u00a030 % of the world's gold reserves (Weatherley and Henley, 2013). The concept of \u201corogenic Au deposit\u201d originated from workers at the U.S. Geological Survey to define these epigenetic and structurally hosted deposits in metamorphic rocks (B\u00f6hlke, 1982; Goldfarb et al., 2005). Three types of Au-bearing deposits hosted in greenstone\/turbidite\/BIF-hosted types were regarded as orogenic Au deposits, sharing a number of similar characteristics (Robert et al., 2007). The crustal continuum model for orogenic Au deposits came up ruling out the classification on the basis of Au\/Ag ratios and wall rocks (Groves et al., 1998; Kerrich et al., 2000). At present, the features of orogenic Au deposits consist of location in the periphery of metamorphosed arc, formed within extensive thermodynamic equilibration relative to wall rocks, and lack of vertical alteration zoning (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Chen, 2006). Among orogenic Au deposits, the deposits hosted in greenschist facies account for the vast majority with respect to those in lower or higher grade metamorphic rocks (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Lawrence et al., 2013). The orogenic Au deposits are linked to major crustal structures (the first-order) and hosted in the secondary fractures (Groves et al., 2003; Goldfarb et al., 2005). Their ore fluids contain abundant CO2 as well as significant concentrations of CH4 and\/or N2, a near-neutral pH and moderate-low temperatures and salinities (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). The largest Au resources of this type are recognized in central Asia, eastern Russia, interior Alaska, and eastern China (Goldfarb et al., 2005). As a world-class producer in the world, China contains many famous orogenic gold provinces such as Tianshan, Xiaoqinling and Jiaodong (Deng and Wang, 2016). Xiaoqinling and Jiaodong, as China's two largest gold provinces, were considered to be formed in the collisional orogenic process and accretionary orogenic process, respectively (Jiang et al., 2009).\nAlong the Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt, the Tongbai area is one of the other most important gold metallogenic provinces except for the Xiaoqinling area. Most of Au (and Ag) deposits in the Tongbai orogen concentrate in two areas: Tongbai country and Suizao area, and furthermore, there are also a series of small Au-Ag deposits (prospects) in the Hongshi area of Hubei Province (Wen et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013; Niu et al., 2019c; Yang et al., 2021). The Tongbai country comprises several giant deposits such as the Yingdongpo Au-Ag deposit, the Poshan Ag deposit, the Yingdongling Ag-polymetallic deposit, and the Laowan Au deposit (e.g., Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015, 2021). They were formed in middle-late Mesozoic (176\u2013100\u00a0Ma) during a tectonic setting changed from anterior collisional compression to posterior extension (Zhang et al., 2008, 2013). On the contrary, these deposits represented by the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit at Suizao area lack systematic research. The Suizao area hosts 57\u00a0t Au, 621\u00a0t Ag and about 130 kt Mo metals, suggesting it is another significant Au-Ag minerogenetic province in the Tongbai orogen. The Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit is a medium sized Au deposit at Suizao area, comprising 5.4\u00a0t Au and 10\u00a0t Ag (Xiao et al., 2018). So far, several new gold prospects (Louziwan, Laoyanwo and Shizikouzhai) have been subsequently discovered, indicating that the metal reserves of this deposit will be further increased along with the on-going exploration. Foregone researches on the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit are rare and only focused on geological features, leading to the ambiguities on fluid source and ore genesis (e.g., Hu et al., 2003). In this contribution, we intensively center on fluid origin and evolution and sulfur source, in order to determine the genesis of the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Qinling-Dabie complex orogen between the North China and Yangtze blocks is one of the famous continental collision orogenic belts in China and was formed during the Mesozoic (Fig. 1\nA; Chen et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). The Qinling-Dabie orogen is truncated by the Nanyang Basin into the Qinling orogen and the Tongbai-Dabie orogen in space, and the latter can be further divided into the Tongbai orogen, the Hong\u2019an orogen and the Dabie orogen, which share more similar geological setting relative to the Qinling orogen (Fig. 1B; Wu and Zheng, 2013; Dong and Santosh, 2016; Zheng et al., 2019). As the crucial junction between the Qinling orogenic belt and the Hong\u2019an-Dabie orogenic belt, the Tongbai orogen has gradually attracted the attention of geologists due to its vast magmatic rocks and obvious Au-Ag metallogenic potential (e.g., Niu and Jiang, 2020; Yang et al., 2021).\nThe Suizao (Suizhou-Zaoyang) region, situated in the northwestern of Hubei Province and westernmost of the Tongbai orogen, is a key area to study the geological evolution of the Tongbai orogen (Fig. 1B). Meanwhile, the Suizao area is rich in a series of Au-Ag-Cu-Mo-Pb-Zn deposits, represented by the Wushan Cu-Mo deposit, Wangjiadashan Cu-Au deposit, Zaopa Ag-Mo deposit, and Huangjiagou Mo deposit, (Fig. 2\n; Wang and Wang, 2014; Chen et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2019a\u2013c). Most of these deposits situate around granite intrusions and are closely related to faults in the area.\nThe Xincheng-Huangpi (Xin-Huang) fault and the Wushan fault, as well as some secondary structures constituent constructed subject at Suizao area, which were all basically formed by continuous extrusion and later extension of two enormous blocks (Fig. 2; Xiao et al., 2018). The Xin-Huang fault is a giant shear zone with an extension of\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0km, which limits the Tongbai complex in the southwestern by a mylonitic zone with about 2\u00a0km width (Cheng et al., 2012). The Xin-Huang fault experienced early southwestward thrusting around 234\u00a0Ma and uplifting during 234\u2013195\u00a0Ma, then it occurred NW-SE trending dextral strike-slip shearing and formed at about 145\u00a0Ma finally. The Au-Ag-polymetallic deposits along the Xin-Huang fault comprise Waiduoshan, Jiangjunling, Shibanhe, Wangerzhuang, Hehe, Hualugou and Daijiawan from northwest to southeast (Fig. 2; Hu et al., 2003; Peng et al., 2017). The Wushan fault was mainly active in Yanshanian period, which controls plentiful of ore deposits including Mayishan, Shifosi, Sunjiazhuang, Liufan, Zaopa, Youfanghe, Xiaqiegou (Xiao et al., 2018).\nThe Tongbai complex crops out in the northeastern of the Suizao region, consisting of the Late Mesozoic gneissic granites and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, in which the Huangjiagou Mo deposit occurs (Wu et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017). The strata include a suit of middle-low grade metamorphic rocks, consisting of the Dengying, Doushantuo, Wudang, Sigou and Yaolinghe groups (Fig. 2; Leng et al., 2015). The Wudang and Yaolinghe groups, mainly around the Qijianfeng granite complex, are a series of mafic and intermediate-felsic volcanic sedimentary metamorphic rocks and contain dolomite-albite schist, epidote-actinolite schist and greenschist, with thickness of\u00a0>\u00a07000\u00a0m (Fig. 2; Wu et al., 2020). They are most closely related to the Au deposits and belong to the important Au-bearing horizons in the area (Niu et al., 2019a). The Doushantuo and Dengying groups mostly exposure in the southwestern of the Wushan fault and constitute dolomitic schist, sericite schist, dolomitic marble, sandstone, siltstone and mudstone, of which sericite and dolomite-quartz schists are relevant with Au mineralization in this area (Xiang et al., 2021).\nThe Qijianfeng granite complex with an exposed area of around 192\u00a0km2, is the maximal intrusion in the Suizao district, of which lithology is biotite monzogranite (Fig. 2; Wen et al., 2014). The Qijinanfeng granite intruded into this area at approximately 135\u2013139\u00a0Ma of the Early Cretaceous (Niu and Jiang, 2020). Furthermore, there are some small intermediate-felsic dykes such as the Wushan granite porphyry dykes and the Wangjiadashan syenite porphyry dykes, and most of them are associated with surrounding Au-Cu-Mo deposits (Niu et al., 2019a,b). The Dafushan ultramafic complex and sporadic diabases are deemed to form in the Paleozoic period.\n\n\n3\nOre deposit geology\nThe Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit is situated in the southeastern of the Suizao area and locates close to the Qijianfeng granite complex in the southwestern (Fig. 2). The NW-trending Heilongtan fault runs through the orefield, which is usually considered as a secondary structure of the strike-slip tectonic belt composed of the Xin-Huang and Wushan faults (Fig. 3\nA; Peng, 1993;\nXiao et al., 2018). The Heilongtan fault with an overall trend of 300\u00b0, has a>14\u00a0km length and ca. 2\u00a0m width.\nThe main strata of the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit include the Wudang, Yaolinghe and Doushantuo groups, in which the Wudang and Yaolinghe groups are the main Au-bearing strata at Suizao area (Hu et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2021). The Wudang Group formed in Mesoproterozoic and comprises a set of middle-low grade metamorphosed volcanic rocks, dominantly composed of granulites and greenschists (Niu et al., 2019c). The Neoproterozoic strata include the Yaolinghe and Wudang groups, which are part of low-grade metamorphic rocks and constitute quartz schist, albite\/epidote-actinolite schist, sericite schist, and carbonaceous quartzite schist, together with dolomitic marble (Leng et al., 2015). The magmatic rocks are infrequently associated with some dykes composed of metabasic rocks, meta-kersantites and meta-syenite porphyries, and most of them are distributed in the Wudang and Yaolinghe groups (Zhang et al., 2021).\nThe Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit is composed of Heilongtan, Wangjiawan and Xiejiagou ore blocks, distributed along the Heilongtan fault from northwest to southeast (Fig. 3A). As a medium-sized Au deposit, the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit contains average Au grade of 5.04\u00a0g\/t and Ag grade between 155.6 and 221.6\u00a0g\/t. This deposit is one of the most economic deposits discovered in recent years. Heilongtan is located about 45\u00a0km northwestern of the Suizhou city with a geographical coordinate of 113\u00b018 '25 \u201c\u223c 113\u00b019\u2032 41\u2033 E and 32\u00b005 '59 \u201d\u223c 32\u00b006\u2032 38\u2033 (Fig. 3B). Nineteen exposed and five concealed ore bodies are identified recently that comprise 1595\u00a0kg Au and 46762\u00a0kg Ag. These ore bodies occur in the alteration zone and appear bedded, lentoid and veined, which share some similar occurrences (Fig. 3D; Wang and Xia, 2017). Most ore bodies yield strike of 290\u00b0 \u223c 320\u00b0 and trend southward with 20\u00b0 \u223c 45\u00b0. Located in the northwestern of the Suizhou city, Xiejiagou is under the jurisdiction of Suixian county and its geographic coordinates are 113\u00b021 '29 \u201cE and 32\u00b004\u2032 49\u2033 N. In contrast to Heilongtan, Xiejiagou contains more Au reserve (3308\u00a0kg) but less Ag (18222\u00a0kg). Its ore bodies occur in first- and second-order faults but concentrate on the part between W980 and W1092 (93%).\nThe primary alteration at Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit contains sericite, potassium, sodium and carbonate alterations, and three hydrothermal stages were documented, including (I) feldspar (K-feldspar and albite)-quartz-sericite-pyrite vein stage, characterized by thickened and black gray quartz with stellate pyrite and sericite (Fig. 4\nA-D; Fig. 5\nA); (II) quartz-sulfides vein stage, these hydrothermal veins are usually off-white and thin, which crosscut the veins at stage I or wrap the brecciated veins at stage I (Fig. 4C, D). The sulfides at this stage include pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, tetrahedrite and sphalerite (Fig. 4E-G). Pyrite was formed first and the other sulfides have no obvious precedence relationship (Fig. 5B-E), and gold distributes in the cracks of pyrite and chalcopyrite (Fig. 5F, G). (III) quartz-carbonate-sulfide vein stage, these veins often cut through the above veins (Fig. 4H, I), and relative to stage II, the amounts of carbonate (calcite and dolomite) increased significantly but chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite decreased at this stage, together with the occurrence of barite (Fig. 4J-L; Fig. 5H, I). The paragenetic assemblage and estimated content for ore minerals of this deposit are shown in Fig. 6\n.\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical methods\nThe studied samples were collected from the Heilongtan, Wangjiawan and Xiejiagou ore blocks, including surface outcrops, trenches and underground mine.\nWe accomplished fluid inclusion studies constituting petrography and microthermometry in the fluid inclusion research laboratory of Collaborative Innovation Center for Exploration of Strategic Mineral Resources (CIC-ESMR), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan. In situ analyses comprising the Laser Raman of single fluid inclusion and sulfur isotopic compositions were respectively carried out at Laser Raman Laboratory and Ore Deposit Geochemistry Laboratory of State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (SKL-GPMR), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan. The stable isotope measurements (C\u2013H-O) for quartz (O) and its fluid inclusions (H-C) and calcite (C-O) were accomplished at Stable Isotope Geology Laboratory of the Institute of Mineral Resources (CAS) and Key Laboratory of Tectonics and Petroleum Resources (CUG), respectively.\nWe made twenty-five thermometric sections to study fluid inclusions in the aspect of sizes, morphologies, phase compositions and proportions of fluid inclusions, as well as fluid types and spatial distributions of collective fluid inclusions. During the above processes, the foremost works incorporated precluding secondary fluid inclusions and recording information (statistics and photographs). Eighteen representative samples (five, ten and three for stage I, II and III) were singled out for analyses of microscopic temperature measurement and Laser Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The used instrument for fluid inclusion microthermometry is a Linkham THMS-600, which is installed with a Leica DM2700P microscope. During analysis, a television camera and a monitor connected to the above device are used for observing and recording. The heating and freezing stages were calibrated using synthetic inclusions (pure H2O: ice melting temperature\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0\u00b0C; critical temperature\u00a0=\u00a0374.1\u00a0\u00b0C; and pure CO2: CO2 melting temperature\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a056.6\u00a0\u00b0C), and the heating\/cooling rate of the inclusions was 0.2\u20135.0\u00a0\u00b0C \/min, generally, but less than 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C \/min near the phase transition. First, we selected the fluid inclusions to be measured under the microscope, and then completed the photography and petrographic description. Second, in the heating process from \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, we obtained the final measured data include ice melting temperature (Tm-ice), eutectic temperatures (Teu), melting temperature of clathrate (Tm-cla), melting temperature of solid CO2 (Tm-CO2), homogenization temperature of CO2 liquid and vapor (Th-CO2), and total homogenization temperature (Th), which are presented in Table 1\n. Third, the salinities were calculated using the equations of Bodnar and Vityk (1994) for aqueous fluid inclusions, and the formula proposed by Darling (1991) for aqueous-carbonic fluid inclusions (Schmidt and Bodnar, 2000). We used a DXR Laser Raman spectrometer for analysis of fluid inclusions, and it has an Ar\u00a0+\u00a0ion laser emitter of 514.5\u00a0nm within a surface power of 20\u00a0MW. The exposure time and exposure range can be adjusted as needed within the limits of 10\u201340\u00a0s and 0\u20135000\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. Before each analysis, the parameters of the instrument have been adjusted to the consistent.\nThe fluid inclusions in quartz were used for analyses of the hydrogen and carbon isotopic compositions. Quartz samples from hydrothermal stages were collected and crushed to about 40\u201360 mesh, and then were purified at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h under vacuum condition. Subsequently, the above samples were heated up to about 500\u00a0\u00b0C in terms of an induction furnace, and a mixture of H2O and CO2 could be extracted, which were immediately separated by a sophisticated device. The acquired water was reacted with pure zinc at temperature of 400\u00a0\u00b0C, and then reduced to H2 for the H isotope analysis. We gathered and concentrated the detached CO2 during last step for the C isotope measurement. The generated O2 by the reaction between pure quartz and BrF5 were transformed into CO2 by a Pt-plated carbon bar for the O isotope measurement. The raw data were standardized by the V-SMOW standard. On the basis of measurements for duplicated and standard samples, approximately\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u2030 precision was estimated for data of \u03b4D, and about\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030 for data of \u03b418O and \u03b413C. The O isotope conversion between quartz and water was used the equation of 1000ln \u03b1Quartz\u2212H2O\u00a0=\u00a03.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106T\u22122\u00a0\u20133.40 (Clayton et al., 1972). Among calculation, the values of \u201cT\u201d resulted from the intermediate value of the peak of complete homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions at corresponding stage.\nWe grinded up the collected calcite into powder, and made them thoroughly react with 100% phosphoric acid to produce CO2, which was used for the C-O isotope analysis by gas mass spectrometer. The ultimate C and O isotope data were demonstrated through the V-PDB and the V-SMOW standards, respectively.\nThe equipment of a MC-ICP-MS (Nu Plasma II) combined with a laser ablation system of Excimer ArF (Resonetics-S155) was used for in situ S-isotope analysis, of which programmed parameters consisting of spot diameter of 23\u00a0\u03bcm, frequency of 5\u00a0Hz and denudation time of 40\u00a0s (cf. Liu et al., 2017). The denuded samples mixed with carrier gas composed of ultrapure He and Ar gases with a spot of N2, were entered into mass spectrometer for analysis. During analysis, two standard samples were also analyzed, including the NBS-123 (international sphalerite standard) and WS-1 (in-house laboratory pyrite standard; Whitehouse et al., 2005). The final 34S\/32S data were reported to the SSB standard within an approximate analytical precision (1\u03c3) of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 \u2030 (Zhu et al., 2017).\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nPetrography of fluid inclusions\nThree types of fluid inclusions trapped in quartz and calcite are recognized at Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit, including (1) fluid inclusions within two aqueous phases (S1 type); (2) three-phase fluid inclusions containing water and carbon dioxide (S2 type); and (3) pure carbonic fluid inclusions with two phases (S3 type).\n\nS1 type: This type of fluid inclusion consists of liquid H2O (LH2O) and vapor H2O (VH2O), in which vapor H2O phase ranges from 30 to 70% (Fig. 7\nA, B). Mostly, they are rounded and elliptical shapes with long axis between 3 and 8\u00a0\u03bcm, while irregular shapes are also common. Moreover, these fluid inclusions exhibit distributions of thread and community, as well as isolated in both quartz and calcite grains.\n\nS2 type: Three coexisting phases can be visible in this type of fluid inclusion, composed of vapor CO2 (VCO2), liquid CO2 (LCO2) and H2O (LH2O), and this type was only found in quartz (Fig. 7C, D). The CO2 phases (LCO2 and VCO2) usually occupy 50 to 80 % for the total volume of this type fluid inclusion, most of which are generally elliptical and isolated, and their long axis varying from 3 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm.\n\nS3 type: This type fluid inclusion has two phases of liquid CO2 and vapor CO2, and the volume of vapor CO2 is less than 30 % (Fig. 7E, F). The S3 type fluid inclusions are widely distributed in quartz and calcite with elliptical shapes, but their sizes are normally smaller than the above two types. The majority of them are in groups, and the isolated is unfamiliar.\nThe fluid inclusions types, proportions and assemblages are significantly diverse at three hydrothermal stages.\n\nStage I: Quartz at this stage hosts the above three types of fluid inclusions (S1, S2 and S3). In terms of quantity, the most common fluid inclusion assemblages are S1 type community with different ratios of VH2O phase (Fig. 7G), and the following assemblages are S3 type aggregation and the composite fluid inclusion assemblages containing S2 and S3 type inclusions (Fig. 7I). Under normal circumstances, the sort of three-phases fluid inclusions (S2 type) is isolated distribution (Fig. 7C).\n\nStage II: All three types are observed in quartz at this stage. Similar to stage I, the composite types of fluid inclusions at this stage have different morphology and volume ratios of VH2O phase in S1 type clusters, together with S3 type groups (Fig. 7H). Subsequently, the S2 type fluid inclusions frequently coexist with the other two types to form complex groups, which are also plentiful at this stage (Fig. 7J).\n\nStage III: Quartz and calcite at this stage only consist of S1 and S2 types of fluid inclusions and no S3 type, and the fluid inclusions assemblages made by them are overwhelming in quartz, and no fluid inclusion clusters present in calcite but only isolated S1 and S2 types (Fig. 7F).\n\n\n5.2\nLaser Raman spectroscopy\nIn the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit, we analyzed the composition of about 20 fluid inclusions by laser Raman, in which the Raman spectral images of three typical fluid inclusions are shown in Fig. 8\n. The S1 type fluid inclusions in quartz are dominated by abundant H2O (3454\u00a0cm\u22121 and 3429\u00a0cm\u22121) in vapor and liquid phases (Fig. 8A, B). From inside to outside, three phases of the S2 type in quartz are successively confirmed to be CO2 (1284 and 1386\u00a0cm\u22121), CO2 (1281 and 1383\u00a0cm\u22121) and H2O (3451\u00a0cm\u22121) with faint CO2 (1278 and 1383\u00a0cm\u22121) (Fig. 8C-E). Few S1 type inclusions in quartz also have a spot of CO2 (1281 and 1383\u00a0cm\u22121) (Fig. 8F).\n\n\n5.3\nMicrothermometry\nWe selected the representative fluid inclusions relative to the three types identified above, which are hosted in quartz and calcite, respectively, in order to confirm fluid properties. The recorded raw data (e.g., Tm-ice, Teu, Tm-cla, Tm-CO2, Th-CO2 and Th) during the heating process, together with the calculated salinities and densities (CO2 and bulk densities) are listed in Table 1 and shown in Figs. 9-11\n\n\n.\n\nStage I: The statistical data about eutectic temperatures for S1 type are limited from \u221224.8 to \u221221.3\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9D), approaching to the triple-point temperature of pure NaCl (-20.8\u00a0\u00b0C). The S1 type fluid inclusions have a confined range of ice-melting temperatures (Th-ice) between \u221210.7 and \u22127.2\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9E), matching the relative salinities of 10.7\u201315.6\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. (Fig. 10B). The entirety of S1 type fluid inclusions would reach the uniform state at temperatures of 258\u2013339\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10B), corresponding to bulk densities of 0.78\u20130.90\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 12\nA).\nThe S2 type fluid inclusions yield initial melting temperatures (Tm-ice) of \u221259.6 to \u221256.4\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9A), closing to the triple point temperature of absolute carbon dioxide (-56.6\u00a0\u00b0C). The melting temperatures of CO2 clathrates (Tm-cla) in the S2 type are between 1.0 and 4.4\u00a0\u00b0C, with calculated salinities varying from 9.9 to 15.6\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. (Fig. 10B). The carbonic phase of the S2 type came up to uniform liquid phase during 23.1\u201330.6\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9C), and the complete homogenization temperatures of the S2 type vary from 224 to 336\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10A). On the basis of raw data, we could obtain the CO2 densities of 0.56\u20130.78\u00a0g\/cm3 and bulk densities 0.86\u20131.01\u00a0g\/cm3 with regard to S2 type fluid inclusions.\nThe S3 type fluid inclusions reveal an initial melting temperature of \u221257.1\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9A), which is inferred to be mainly CO2 in the gaseous composition. The complete homogenization temperatures to liquid phase are from 26.7 to 29.7\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9C), with relevant CO2 densities of 0.61\u20130.69\u00a0g\/cm3.\n\nStage II: The fluid inclusions of S1 type show the eutectic temperatures varying from \u201323.5 to \u221221.0\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9I), and ice-melting temperatures (Th-ice) between \u22128.9 and \u22123.9\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9J), as well as calculated salinities within range of 6.3 to 12.7\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. (Fig. 10D). This type fluid inclusions were commonly uniformed into liquid ranging from 182 to 273\u00a0\u00b0C and contain bulk densities of 0.82\u20130.93\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 10C).\nThe S2 type fluid inclusions exhibit a restricted temperature of initial melting (Tm-ice) within extent of \u221259.3 to \u221256.3\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9F), implying that there is minor other gas (except CO2) with respect to their closing to triple-point temperature of CO2 (-56.6\u00a0\u00b0C). According to the melting temperatures of CO2 clathrates (Tm-cla) ranging from 3.0 to 6.5\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9 G), we acquired the salinities varying from 6.6 to 11.9\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. of S2 type in the homogeneous condition (Fig. 10D). The carbonic phases and holistic phases of S2 type fluid inclusions attained uniformity of liquid phase within the limits of 22.7 to 30.6\u00a0\u00b0C and 189 to 301\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 9H; Fig. 10C). The S2 type fluid inclusions exhibit CO2 densities of 0.56\u20130.74\u00a0g\/cm3, and the corresponding bulk densities are 0.86\u20131.00\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 12B).\n\nStage III: The S1 type fluid inclusions trapped in quartz have the eutectic temperatures of \u221221.3 to \u221220.8\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9N), which is equivalent to the triple point temperature of NaCl (-20.8\u00a0\u00b0C). Subsequently, this type shows the ice-melting temperatures (Th-ice) and the complete homogenization temperatures within a range from \u22125.2 to \u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0C and 138 to 249\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 9O, 10E), and the computed data include salinities varying from 2.9 to 8.1\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. and bulk densities of 0.84\u20131.06\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 10F).\nThe S1 type fluid inclusions hosted in calcite exhibit temperatures from \u201322.3 to \u221221.2\u00a0\u00b0C for eutectics and \u22124.7 to \u22121.7\u00a0\u00b0C for ice-melting temperatures (Th-ice), together with confining to 148\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C for the complete homogenization temperatures (Fig. 9N, O; 10E). The posterior values of calculation included the salinities of 2.9\u20137.4\u00a0wt% NaCl eq., as well as bulk densities of 0.91\u20131.04\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 10F).\nThe S2 type fluid inclusions in quartz show initial melting temperatures (Tm-ice) varying from \u221258.7 to \u221257.1\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9K), approximately consistent with the triple point temperature of pure CO2 (-56.6\u00a0\u00b0C); and their uniform temperature of carbonic phases to liquid phase are between 27.3 and 28.9\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 9M). The melting temperatures of CO2 clathrates (Tm-cla) with regard to S2 type fluid inclusions are from 5.6 to 7.5\u00a0\u00b0C, and the relevant salinities are 4.9\u20138.1\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. (Fig. 10F). These types of fluid inclusions were completely uniformed from 164 to 197\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 10E), with corresponding CO2 densities of 0.63\u20130.67\u00a0g\/cm3 and bulk densities of 0.97\u20130.99\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 12C).\n\n\n5.4\nH-O-C isotope data\nThe raw and calculated data for H-O-C isotopes at Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit are listed in Table 2\n and presented in Figs. 13-16\n\n\n\n. The quartz samples of three hydrothermal stages yield \u03b418OV-SMOW values ranging from 10.4 to 11.4 \u2030, 10 to 11.8 \u2030 and 10.2 \u2030, together with fluid inclusion \u03b4DV-SMOW values between \u221298 and \u221283 \u2030, \u221289 and \u221278 \u2030, and \u221279 \u2030, respectively (Fig. 13). The calculated \u03b418OWater for three stages are successively 3.1 to 4.1 \u2030 (I), 0 to 1.8 \u2030 (II), and \u22122.2 \u2030 (III), respectively. The CO2 extracted from fluid inclusions hosted in quartz exhibit a restricted \u03b413CCO2 value, ranging from \u221210.7 to \u22129.3 \u2030 at stage I, \u221210.3 to \u22128.0 \u2030 at stage II, and \u22127.3 \u2030 at stage III, respectively (Table 2; Figs. 14, 15).\nThe calcites at stage III show \u03b413CV-PDB values varying from \u22124.4 to 0.3 \u2030, and \u03b418OV-PDB values between \u221220.9 and \u221218.1 \u2030, with corresponding \u03b418OSMOW values of 9.4\u201312.2 \u2030 (Fig. 16).\n\n\n5.5\nSulfur isotope data\nAbundant sulfides including galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite and pyrite and sulphates (e.g., barite) were recognized at hydrothermal stages, and the representative samples were analyzed for in situ sulfur isotope compositions, which are listed in Table 3\n and shown in Fig. 17\n.\nThe pyrites at stage I yield positive \u03b434S values within the range of 1.6\u201315.9 \u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a029), with a mean value of 5.3 \u2030 (Fig. 17A), while the pyrites at stage II show \u03b434S values from \u22127.7 to 7.9 \u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a015), averaging about 0.5 \u2030. The \u03b434S values of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and tetrahedrite at stage II vary from \u22122.2 to 1.7 \u2030 (mean \u22120.8 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a09), \u22127.5 to \u22121.7 \u2030 (mean \u22124.1 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a09), \u22121.6 to \u22120.4 \u2030 (mean \u22121.1 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a06), and \u22126.4 to \u22123.8 \u2030 (mean \u22125.0 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a05) (Fig. 17B).\nThe \u03b434S values of sulfides at stage III include pyrite of \u22125.9 to 5.4 \u2030 (mean 2.0 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a07), chalcopyrite of \u221220.5 to \u22127.9 \u2030 (mean \u221213.5 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a04), galena of \u221212.9 to \u22122.2 \u2030 (mean \u22128.0 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a05), sphalerite of \u221210.1 to 1.6 \u2030 (mean \u22125.6 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a03) and tetrahedrite of \u22129.9 to \u22128.0 \u2030 (mean \u22129.0 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a02), and the \u03b434S values of barite at stage III are between 8.5 and 9.7 \u2030 (mean 9.7 \u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a03; Fig. 17C).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nFluid immiscibility and pressure\nFluid immiscibility, in which the same fluid is divided into two fluids with different properties and composition due to sudden changes in physical conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure and composition), is very common in many hydrothermal ore deposits (e.g., Lu, 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Chi et al., 2021; Wan et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). As an important ore-forming mechanism, phase separation caused by fluid immiscibility destroy the equilibrium state of the original fluid and further lead to enrichment and precipitation of ore-forming materials (Lu et al., 2004; Soloviev and Kryazhev, 2017; Niu et al., 2019b; Shapovalov et al., 2019). Combined with the characteristics of fluid immiscibility (Wang et al., 2015; Chi et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2021), we suggest that fluid immiscibility occurred in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit during mineralization, evidenced by (1) the aqueous fluid inclusions (S1) have variable ratios of vapor\/liquid phase, and they coexist in the same quartz crystal, implying that they were captured simultaneously (Fig. 7A, B, G, H); (2) the aqueous S1 type fluid inclusions and containing-CO2 S2 (or S3) type fluid inclusions coexist in the same crystal (Fig. 7I, J); (3) the coexisting S1 type fluid inclusions with different V\/L ratios and assemblage of S1 and S2 types fluid inclusions have similar complete homogenization temperatures (Fig. 10B, D, F); (4) few S1 type fluid inclusions also contain CO2 in the vapor phase (Fig. 8F). The fluid inclusions at three stages all show fluid immiscibility, which indicates that fluid immiscibility runs through the fluid evolution process of the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit (Fig. 7H-J; Feng et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021). However, abundant S3 type fluid inclusions only existed at stage I. Furthermore, the number of S2 type fluid inclusions gradually decreases from stage I, through stage II, to stage III, while S1 type keeps increasing (Table 1). Hence the fluid immiscibility gradually weakens from early to late, and finally the dominant fluid becomes single aqueous phase (stage III).\nData such as fluid temperature, salinity and density obtained from fluid inclusions can be used to calculate fluid pressures, for example, the NaCl-H2O system suggested by Bouzari and Clark (2006) and Driesner and Heinrich (2007), and the H2O-NaCl-CO2 system suggested by Matthew (2018). However, the ore-forming fluid in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit is not a single NaCl-H2O or H2O-NaCl-CO2 system, so it is impossible to use the above formula to calculate pressure. Hence, we chose the united P-T diagram of H2O and CO2 to calculate fluid pressure, considering fluid immiscibility in this study (Roedder and Bodnar, 1980; Lu et al., 2004), and the densities of H2O and CO2 are derived from S1 and S2 type fluid inclusions, respectively (Table 1). The results show that the pressures of fluid inclusions at stage I range from 52 to 185\u00a0MPa, and the stages II and III vary from 42 to 128\u00a0MPa and 19 to 96\u00a0MPa, respectively (Fig. 12A-C). The corresponding temperatures of 196\u2013380\u00a0\u00b0C, 153\u2013314\u00a0\u00b0C and 68\u2013275\u00a0\u00b0C are similar to the complete homogenization temperatures of 224\u2013339\u00a0\u00b0C (stage I), 182\u2013301\u00a0\u00b0C (stage II) and 138\u2013249\u00a0\u00b0C (stage III) by microthermometry (Fig. 10B, D, F), suggesting that the method we have chosen is reasonable. Given fluid immiscibility in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit, the obtained pressures of fluid inclusions are consistent with their trapping pressures (Brown and Hagemann, 1995). When assuming a rock density of about 2.7\u00a0g\/cm3, the fluid depths are 1.9\u20136.9\u00a0km at stage I, 1.6\u20134.7\u00a0km at stage II and 0.7\u20133.5\u00a0km at stage III, respectively.\n\n\n6.2\nOrigin of the ore-forming fluids\nAlong with fluid evolution, the average values of \u03b4D in quartz fluid inclusions show an incremental tendency from \u221291\u2030, through \u221284\u2030, to \u221279\u2030, whereas the calculated \u03b418Owater show a decreasing trend from 3.6\u2030, through 1.2\u2030, to \u22122.2\u2030 (Fig. 13). The H-O isotope data at Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit all point into the sandwiching fields ranging primary magmatic water to meteoric water, and imply a magmatic water as the initial fluid affected by late meteoric water (Fig. 13).\nThe carbon from different source region exhibits discrepant values of \u03b413C, which can be used to confirm the source of host minerals. For example, the carbon associated with sedimentary and biogenic origin manifests the extremely negative \u03b413C within the range of \u221235 to \u221215 \u2030, and the \u03b413C values ranging from \u22129 to \u22123 \u2030 are accordant with a mantle source (Ohmoto, 1972; Taylor, 1986). Comparatively, the marine origin exhibits the \u03b413C value next to 0 \u2030 (Veizer et al., 1980). All of \u03b413C values from fluid inclusions at three stages fall within the mixed fields between dehydroxylation of sedimentary organic carbon and magmatic carbon (Fig. 14). On the \u03b413CV-PDB vs. \u03b418OV-PDB diagram, all data from three stages are extremely closed to the granitic field, implying that magmatic hydrothermal fluid plays an important role during fluid evolution in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit (Fig. 15). The \u03b413CV-PDB values from calcites at stage III show the tendency from igneous carbonate to sedimentary contamination, also indicating a magmatic source affected by sedimentary materials of the surrounding strata (Fig. 16). In conclusion, the initial magmatic hydrothermal mixed with the later meteoric water were as the ore-forming fluid in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit (Baker and Lang, 2001; Baker, 2002).\n\n\n6.3\nSource of ore-forming components\nThe Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit was dominated by abundant sulfides including sphalerite, galena, pyrite, tetrahedrite and chalcopyrite at three stages but only minor sulfates (barite) at stage III, indicating the sulfur isotopic composition of sulfides can approximately represent the \u03b434S values of the ore fluids (Ohmoto, 1972). Combined with published studies (e.g., Hoefs, 2018), sulfur from granite shows \u03b434S values between \u22123 and 9 \u2030, and that from marine environment approaches to 20 \u2030. In contrast, the \u03b434S values of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks exhibit a wide range, from \u221220 to 20 \u2030 and \u221240 to 50 \u2030, respectively. The pyrites at stage I show the \u03b434S values between 0 and 10 \u2030, with some having higher \u03b434S values (\u223c15 \u2030), implying the united contribution of metamorphic and magmatic (granite) origins (Fig. 17A). The sulfides at stage II yield lower \u03b434S values (-7.7 to 7.9 \u2030) with wider range relative to that of stage I, which may be caused by biologic sulfur (metamorphic origin) further involved and mixed with meteoric water (Peng et al., 2018). These sulfides at stage III show extremely large range of the \u03b434S values (-20.5 to 9.7 \u2030), suggesting that metamorphic sulfur dominates at stage III. Therefore, the magmatic sulfur dominated the early fluid (stage I), but the metamorphic sulfur gradually played an important role in the subsequent process (stages II and III). This indicates that ore-forming fluids have obviously leached and extracted from the wall rock strata, including but not limited to gold, reduced sulfur, carbon dioxide and meteoric water.\nIn this deposit, native gold is closely associated with the pyrite at stage II (Fig. 5F, G), and except for natural gold, pyrite is also an important gold-bearing mineral (Liu, 1994). The ore-bearing strata (Wudang and Yaolinghe groups) in the Heilongtan-Xiajiegou deposit, has the highest Clark values of gold and hosts more than half of the gold deposits at Suizao area (Fig. 2; Li, 1996; Peng et al., 2017). In contrast, the Qijianfeng granite on the western of the Heilongtan-Xiajiegou deposit has a very low Clark value of gold, in which there are very few gold deposits. In conclusion, the sources of ore-forming components were stemmed from mixture between magma and surrounding strata, but magmatic contribution of gold was likely limited.\n\n\n6.4\nFluid evolution and ore precipitation\nIn accordance with the eutectic temperature of S1 type and the initial melting temperatures of S2 and S3 types fluid inclusions, we document that the fluid system pertains to H2O-NaCl\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CO2 system in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit (Fig. 9A, F, K; Table 1), which is also confirmed by Laser Raman analyses (Fig. 8). From stage I to stage III, hydrothermal fluids show decreasing temperatures, salinities and pressures (Figs. 11, 12), together with CO2 contents, corresponding to continuous fluid immiscibility, increasingly mixing of meteoric water and decreasing emplacement depth (Baker, 2002).\nThree external factors contribute to fluid immiscibility: (1) shallow depth; (2) high geothermal gradient; and (3) faulting pumping (Chi et al., 2017). The maximum fluid depth we estimated is 6.9\u00a0km, indicating that the early fluid in the studied deposit was not in a shallow environment. The maximum complete homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions we obtained is no>350\u00a0\u00b0C, and fluid temperature does not decrease sharply but progressively with salinity from early stage to late stage (Fig. 11), implying that there is no high geothermal gradient. Hence the suddenly decreasing pressure caused by fluid entering into fault may be the main factor causing fluid immiscibility in the studied deposit, consistent with these Au ore bodies distributed along the Heilongtan fault (Fig. 3B, C).\nThe H-O isotope data also indicate a mixed source of magmatic hydrothermal and meteoric water (Fig. 13), and the magmatic hydrothermal fluids were the initial fluid which mixed with meteoric water as the mineralizing fluid flew into the Heilongtan fault (Zhai et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2021). During this process, the mixing of organic carbon carried in meteoric water results in a mixed source of carbon dioxide (Figs. 14, 16, 18\n; Liu et al., 2018). In this deposit, the initial ore-forming fluid (stage I) is moderate -high temperature magmatic hydrothermal dominated acid fluid with abundant CO2, S2- and Cl- (Fig. 7I), which can extract gold from wall rock strata and migrate in form of Au(HS)2\n- and AuCl2\n- in the fluid (Pirajno, 2009). At the same time, reduced sulfur and carbon dioxide in the wall rocks will also enter the fluid along with the leaching process, evident by carbon and sulfur isotopes (Figs. 14,\u00a017A). As the fluid enters the Heilongtan fault, phase separation due to fluid immiscibility will accelerate the following process: (1) HS-+H+\u2192H2S; (2) HCO3\n\u2013+H+\u2192H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CO2; (3) Au(HS)2\n-\u2192Au0\u00a0+\u00a02HS-; and (4) AuCl2\n-\u2192Au0\u00a0+\u00a02Cl-, resulting in precipitation of gold (e.g., Peng et al., 2021). Therefore, fluid immiscibility due to original fluid entering the Heilongtan fault and constantly additional meteoric waters give rise to ore deposition in the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit.\n\n\n6.5\nOre genesis\nAt present, the ore genetic type of the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit is controversial, and three models were proposed, including magmatic hydrothermal type (Leng et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2017), orogenic type (Liu, 1994) and magmatic and metamorphic hydrothermal mixed type (Hu et al., 2003). The Rb-Sr isochron age of Au-bearing quartz indicates an Early Cretaceous (132.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma) mineralization age for the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit, and the Sr isotopic values of quartz suggest that the metallogenic components result from the blended materials of crust and mantle (Peng et al., 2017). Furthermore, K-Ar dating results of sericite at the mineralization stage were 128\u2013132\u00a0Ma (Hu et al., 2003). Give that the Qijianfeng granitic complex is adjoining neighbor next to the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit in the western and buried granite body may locate at depth under this deposit (Hu et al., 2003), the granites may provide ore-forming fluids and materials. Meanwhile, an approximately emplacement age of 135\u2013139\u00a0Ma for the Qijianfeng complex is similar or slightly earlier than the Rb-Sr or K-Ar ages for the ore formation (Niu and Jiang, 2020; Xiang et al., 2021), which is in line with our hypothesis. Nevertheless, compared with other magmatic hydrothermal vein-type deposits at Suizao area (Fig. 13), the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit yielded similar or slightly lower \u03b4D and \u03b418Owater, suggesting more meteoric water effects (Taylor, 1986), possibly due to its away from the granite body and along the fault zone. The slightly more negative \u03b413C values in this deposit relative to typical magmatic carbon also imply a meteoric water effect that may leach carbon materials from dehydroxylation in host sedimentary rocks, and also sulfur from host strata as indicated by sulfur isotopes. The fluid in the orogenic type deposit, represented by medium\u2013low temperatures and low salinities, together with plentiful CO2 and obvious CH4 and\/or N2 concentrations comes from the fluid released during the greenschist facies metamorphism and mixing of stratal material (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Chen, 2006; Lawrence et al., 2013). Fluid of the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit is dominated by medium\u2013low temperatures and low salinities with abundant CO2, but no significant CH4 or N2 involvement exists in the fluid system by microthermometry and Laser Raman analysis, notwithstanding this deposit is located in the greenschist facies terrane (Fig. 2). Combined with the S-C\u2013H-O isotopes with partial magmatic feature, we suggested that it is less likely the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou Au deposit belongs to orogenic type (Goldfarb et al., 2005), although metamorphic fluid (meteoric water contaminated by carbon in the strata) plays an important role in the mineralization process (Fig. 18). In consequence, the Heilongtan-Xiejiagou deposit appertains the medium\u2013low temperature and hydrothermal vein-type deposit with fluids mixed from magmatic fluid and meteoric water.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe Heilontan-Xiejiagou Au deposit belongs to magmatic hydrothermal vein-type deposit rather than previously proposed orogenic type.\n\n\n(2)\nThree hydrothermal stages exhibit sequentially decreasing temperatures and salinities, characterized by 224 to 339\u00a0\u00b0C with 9.9\u201315.6\u00a0wt% NaCl eq., 182 to 301\u00a0\u00b0C with 6.3\u201312.7\u00a0wt% NaCl eq., and 138 to 249\u00a0\u00b0C with 2.9\u20138.1\u00a0wt% NaCl eq. from stage I to stage III.\n\n\n(3)\nThe sulfur isotope data indicate ore-forming materials were mainly derived from mixture of magma and surrounding metamorphic strata, while the C\u2013H-O isotope data suggest the ore-forming fluid stems from a mixture of magmatic fluid and meteoric water. A hidden granite body at depth of the studied area next to the Qijianfeng granitic complex may have genetic linkage to the ore formation, which provide not only part of the ore-forming materials but also heat energy to drive the fluid circulation.\n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSeawater circulation through the oceanic lithosphere plays a key role in heat and element transfers between the main Earth reservoirs, such as the mantle and seawater (Wolery and Sleep, 1976; Bonatti et al., 1984; Alt, 1995; Allen and Seyfried, 2004; Seyfried et al., 2015; Humphris and Klein, 2018; Le Gal et al., 2018). During final rifting and breakup, extensional tectonics leads to the formation of high-angle normal and exhumation faults, which create preferential pathways for fluid circulation (Jackson, 1987). While hydrothermal fluids flow along these faults, they interact with the surrounding rocks, forming a variety of secondary rocks such as serpentinites, altered mafic rocks (among which rodingites) and ophicalcites (Spooner et al., 1974). These alteration processes occur under a wide range of temperature, pH and redox conditions, leading to the formation of hydrothermal fluids with various chemical compositions (e.g., Fr\u00fch-Green et al., 1990; Von Damm, 1995; Seyfried et al., 2004; Bach et al., 2004). Among them, moderate to high-temperature, acidic and reduced fluids are responsible for the formation of mineralized systems at or near the seafloor (Rona, 1984; Rona et al., 1993; Hannington et al., 2001; Douville et al., 2002). The discovery of ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems along slow- to ultra-slow-spreading ridges (Krasnov, 1995; Fouquet et al., 1998; Cherkashov et al., 2008; Melchert et al., 2008; Tao et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2020) or fossil systems in ophiolites preserved in the Alps (Garuti et al., 2008; Toffolo et al., 2017; Coltat et al., 2019) highlighted that hydrated ultramafic rocks may be suitable sinks for metals. In these geological settings, mineralization is commonly enriched in base (Cu, Zn, Ni), critical (Co), and precious metals (Au and Ag, Fouquet et al., 2013).\nAlthough our understanding of the formation of ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems has improved these last years, the source of metals in the mineralization is not fully constrained yet. Iron, Zn and Cu stable isotope systematics may bring constraints to decipher the source of metals and offer an interesting way of tracing metal mobilities in hydrothermal cells (Rouxel et al., 2004; Rouxel et al., 2004; Debret et al., 2018). However, multiple factors control isotopic fractionation in these systems, including temperature, oxidation-reduction, multi-step processes, preventing to obtain a straightforward interpretation from isotopic compositions solely (Zhu et al., 2002). On the opposite, the strontium isotopes are not subject to significant mass-dependent isotopic fractionation. The Sr isotope systematics are thus likely easier to interpret especially as the main terrestrial reservoirs (mantle reservoirs, continental crust, seawater) have distinct and well-defined Sr isotope compositions. Whereas exchanges between these reservoirs using Sr isotopes have been widely investigated (e.g., Veizer and Compston, 1974; Chapman and Spooner, 1977; Mcculloch et al., 1980; Albarede et al., 1981; Burke et al., 1982; Bach and Humphris, 1999; Boschi et al., 2008; Delacour et al., 2008; Augustin et al., 2012; Schwarzenbach et al., 2021), their application to mineralized systems has not been considered so far.\nIn the Platta nappe, in the SE Swiss Alps, Coltat et al. (2019) identified a Jurassic mineralized system hosted in serpentinites considered to represent an analogue of the root zone of active hydrothermal systems at slow-spreading ridges. The precipitation of metal-bearing phases (sulfides and oxides) was contemporaneous with a Fe-Ca-metasomatism responsible for the precipitation of Fe-Ca silicates (i.e., ilvaite, hydroandradite, diopside, Coltat et al. (2019)). Since Ca and Sr share close chemical properties, these Fe-Ca metasomatic assemblages represent suitable targets for a Sr isotope-based tracing. These assemblages may have recorded isotopic information related to the metal source(s) involved in the formation of seafloor metal ore deposits and its related plumbing system.\nFollowing this idea, we have measured the Sr isotope compositions of the Fe-Ca silicates that act as Sr sink. We also analyzed the potential contributors (i.e., the metasomatic rocks) and we compiled data from the literature. We discuss the implications of our results for the overall understanding of the formation of mineralized systems and more generally of fluid\/rock interactions that occur during detachment-related mantle exhumation in oceanic domains.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nThe Platta nappe\nThe Platta nappe is located in the Central Alps in Grisons, SE Switzerland (Fig. 1\nA). It corresponds to a remnant of the Alpine Tethys Ocean-Continent Transition (OCT), which formed during late Middle Jurassic when Europe and Adria separated. The Platta nappe is composed by serpentinized peridotites, mafic rocks (including basalts and gabbros) and post-rift sediments (Dietrich, 1969; Manatschal and Nievergelt, 1997; Desmurs et al., 2002; Schaltegger et al., 2002; Epin et al., 2019). The Platta nappe is subdivided into two Alpine units (Fig. 1B, C). The Upper Platta Unit mainly consists of serpentinized peridotites that originally formed the inherited subcontinental mantle of the Adriatic distal margin (i.e., the Err domain Schaltegger et al., 2002; M\u00fcntener et al., 2004; M\u00fcntener et al., 2010; Picazo et al., 2016; Epin and Manatschal, 2018). The Lower Platta Unit, originally located further oceanward, consists of a large serpentinized mantle domain locally intruded by Jurassic gabbros and covered by pillow lavas, pillow breccias and locally also lava flows (Desmurs et al., 2002; Amann et al., 2020). Contrarily to the mantle rocks from the Upper Platta Unit that do not exhibit any syn-rift melt imprint, those from the Lower Platta Unit have been largely refertilized by melt percolation during final rifting and breakup (M\u00fcntener et al., 2004; M\u00fcntener et al., 2010).\nThe Platta nappe is separated, along an Alpine thrust, from the nappe stack preserving remnants of the former distal Adriatic continental margin (e.g. Err and more proximal domains of the former Adriatic margin). Slivers of continental origin also occur in the Platta nappe and have been interpreted as extensional allochthons (Froitzheim and Manatschal, 1996). Based on this observation and the subcontinental nature of the mantle, the Platta nappe has been considered as a magma-poor OCT of late Middle Jurassic age (Froitzheim and Manatschal, 1996; Manatschal and Nievergelt, 1997; Fig. 1). Mantle exhumation in the OCT was accommodated along multiple detachment faults (Epin et al., 2019) accompanied with the inception of mafic magmatism. More detailed mapping enabled to propose the existence of a well preserved mantle core complex, capped by a main extensional detachment and overprinted by later high-angle faults (Epin et al., 2019). U-Pb dating on zircons from syn-tectonic mafic intrusions provided a Jurassic age of 161 \n\n\u00b1\n\n1\u00a0Ma for the timing of mantle exhumation (Schaltegger et al., 2002). This exhumation phase was accompanied by intense fluid circulations, leading to (i) serpentinization of ultramafic rocks, (ii) rodingitization of mafic intrusive and epidotization-chloritization of mafic extrusive rocks (Desmurs et al., 2002; Amann et al., 2020), (iii) formation of mineralized systems (Dietrich et al., 1972; Perseil and Latouche, 1989; Coltat et al., 2019) and (iv) carbonation of serpentinites and basalts near and at the seafloor along the exhumed detachment surface (Coltat et al., 2019; Coltat et al., 2020).\nReactivation of the Alpine Tethys margin during Alpine convergence can be subdivided into three stages. During a first Late Cretaceous phase (D1 of Froitzheim (1994)), the whole Adriatic margin was telescoped along major, west-verging thrusts during which the Platta nappe became part of the main Alpine nappe stack (Fig. 1B, C). The second phase (D2) corresponds to a late Cretaceous extensional event forming top-to-the-east to top-to-the-southeast normal faults. This phase is followed by a third phase (D3) that produced east-west trending folds with steeply dipping axial planes and a few north-vergent folds and thrusts with minor displacement (some few meters at a maximum). It is worthy to note that the whole Platta Nappe has been relatively preserved from Alpine deformation (only D1 results in a main overprint) and the metamorphic overprint was week with maximum conditions corresponding to prehnite-pumpellyite metamorphism (less than 350\u00a0\u00b0C) (see Coltat et al., 2021). It is also important to note that the Platta nappe remained in the hanging wall of the Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic subduction, which differs from most Alpine ophiolites exposed in the Western Alps. Therefore, the pre-Alpine seafloor-related structures and hydrothermal alterations remained largely preserved (Froitzheim and Manatschal, 1996; Chalot-Prat et al., 2003; Epin et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.2\nThe Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system\nA well-preserved fossil ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal system, namely the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system, has been recently identified in the Platta Nappe (Coltat et al., 2019; Coltat et al., 2021). This hydrothermal system is preserved in the serpentinized footwall of a detachment fault juxtaposing basalts onto serpentinites (Fig. 1B, Coltat et al., 2019). The serpentinite-hosted mineralization is geometrically associated with mafic intrusions indicating that the latter acted as preferential pathways for the fluid. The Cu-Fe-Co-Zn-Ni mineralization consists of sulfides (mainly chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, (Co-) pentlandite and sphalerite) and oxides (magnetite). Geochemical analyses performed on massive sulfides show enrichments up to 27.7 wt.% Cu, 0.28 wt.% Zn, 0.16 wt.% Co and Ni content of about \n\n\u223c\n\n1500\u00a0ppm, similar to those of unaltered mantle rocks (Coltat et al., 2021). Gold was never concentrated enough to be detected in Cu-rich massive sulfides but Ag concentration reach up to \n\n\u223c\n\n120\u00a0ppm in the most mineralized samples (Coltat et al., 2021). A Fe-Ca-metasomatism responsible for the formation of Fe-Ca silicates such as ilvaite, hydroandradite and Fe-rich diopside as stockwork zones and pervasive replacement zones in serpentinites was coeval with the mineralization (Coltat et al., 2019). Based on petrographic and structural features, the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system is assumed to represent the root of an ultramafic-hosted black smoker system (Coltat et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nField sampling\nIn this study, we present the Sr isotope compositions of 64 samples from the Platta nappe including Fe-Ca silicate minerals (12 samples), carbonated rocks (15 samples), serpentinites (24 samples) and mafic rocks (8 samples). In order to unravel the hydrothermal alterations during the tectonic evolution of the margin, we collected samples at different structural positions along the margin, from the continentward (Upper Platta) to the oceanward (Marmorera-Cotschen, Lower Platta) domains (Table 1\n; Fig. 1B, C). Several Sr sources are supposed to be involved for the considered hydrothermal alterations, such as the Jurassic seawater, the subcontinental lithospheric mantle and the continental crust.\nThe Fe-Ca silicate minerals were sampled at two different sites: Cotschen and Kanonensattel (i.e., the eastern prolongation of the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system, for location see Fig. 1B). The site of Cotschen corresponds to the deepest structural position of the hydrothermal system and is located about 150\u00a0m below the detachment\/seafloor. Based on mineralogical assemblages reported in the mineralization at Kanonensattel, this site also likely corresponds to a deep part of the hydrothermal system, although the contact between serpentinites and mafic rocks (i.e., the detachment surface) has not been observed. The potential variations of the fluid\/rock interactions during Fe-Ca-metasomatism were tested by sampling both Fe-Ca silicate minerals in the stockwork zone (Fig. 2)\nA and those that pervasively replaced the serpentinites (Fig. 2B).\nCarbonated rocks, especially marine carbonates are often used to determine the Sr isotope composition of seawater through geological times since they presumably precipitated at isotopic equilibrium with seawater (Burke et al., 1982). In the Jurassic, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of seawater is between 0.7068 and 0.7078 (DePaolo and Ingram, 1985; Hess et al., 1986; McArthur et al., 1993; Jones et al., 1994; Veizer et al., 1999. In the Platta nappe, ophicalcites and carbonated mafic rocks from different sites (i.e. Cotschen, Marmorera, Falotta, Fig. 1B; Table 1) were analyzed in order to better constrain the Sr isotope value of seawater when carbonation occurred. The sampled rocks include discrete calcite veins crosscutting the serpentinites (i.e. fracture infilling ophicalcites in Coltat et al. (2019)) and mafic rocks (Fig. 2C) as well as thick carbonated shear bands in serpentinites (i.e., foliated ophicalcites in Coltat et al. (2019); Fig. 2D). The latter are assumed to form under higher fluid\/rock ratios than the former, making them suitable candidates to record the original 87Sr\/86Sr value of seawater.\nThe Sr reservoirs implied in the serpentinization of mantle rocks can be deduced from the isotope compositions of serpentinites through the Platta nappe. The serpentinites display several generations of serpentine minerals, with a predominant one presenting a typical mesh texture (the groundmass), and a series of green veins crosscutting the mesh (Fig. 2E; referred to as veins in Table 1). These two types of serpentinite are supposed to record different conditions of formation during mantle exhumation (Picazo et al., 2013).\nIn addition to serpentinites and carbonates, eight mafic rocks, including epidotized and chloritized basalts (Fig. 2F) and chlorite\/actinolite-bearing mafic intrusions have been analyzed. Our geochemical dataset (Table 1) is completed by data from the literature for mafic rocks, rodingites and associated blackwalls of the Platta nappe (See Supplementary material; Stille et al., 1989; Schaltegger et al., 2002; Amann, 2017).\n\n\n3.2\nAnalytical methods\nThe whole-rock analysis of serpentinites and mafic rocks was carried out to determine the Sr and Rb contents of the rocks. Trace elements were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS; Thermo Scientic X series II instrument) at the Institut Terre et Environnement de Strasbourg (ITES). Following the analytical procedure of Chauvel et al. (2011), about 100\u00a0mg of rock powder was precisely weighed and dissolved in Savillex beakers in a HF-HNO3-HClO4 (5:1:1) mixture, during a minimum of 7\u00a0days at 140\u00a0\u00b0C on a hot plate. The solution was then evaporated and the residue dissolved in concentrated HNO3 and evaporated before dilution in about 40\u00a0ml of 7\u00a0M HNO3.\nThe Sr isotope compositions of whole rock samples (serpentinites, mafic rocks, rodingites and blackwall) were determined at the Institut Terre et Environnement de Strasbourg (ITES) using a Neptune Thermo Scientific instrument Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) and a Thermo Finnigan Triton instrument Thermal Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (TIMS). About 100\u00a0mg of rock powder was dissolved and digested in a HF:HNO3:HClO4 (5:1:1) mixture for 7\u00a0days. The samples were then evaporated and the residues taken up in concentrated HNO3 to ensure complete dissolution. After another evaporation, the samples were finally dissolved in 2\u00a0ml of 2\u00a0M HNO3 before being loaded in resin columns (Eichrom Sr-spec resin), washed with 5.5\u00a0ml of HNO3 7\u00a0M and then eluted with 2.4\u00a0ml of HNO3 0.05\u00a0M. Chemical separation and purification were performed following an analytical procedure modified after Pin and Zaldueguil (1997) and Deniel and Pin (2001). Measured 87Sr\/86Sr ratios were normalized to 86Sr\/88Sr \u00a0=\u00a00.1194. During the collection of isotopic data, replicate analysis of NBS 987 (SrCO3) reference material gave a mean value of 0.710260 \n\n\u00b1\n\n 8 (2 SE, n \u00a0=\u00a026). The total procedural blank for the whole chemical treatment was 207\u2013233\u00a0pg, negligible for all samples.\nThe Sr isotope composition of carbonates were determined at Geosciences Rennes, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1, using a Mat Finnigan 262 instrument (TIMS). Approximatively 10\u00a0mg of rock powder were sampled by micro drilling and then dissolved in 2.5\u00a0M HCl before chemical separation.\nThe 87Sr\/86Sr ratios for serpentinites, mafic rocks, rodingites and blackwalls were recalculated at 160\u00a0Ma, based on the age of magmatic intrusions and gabbros of the Platta nappe. For Fe-Ca silicates, Rb concentrations were systematically below the detection limit, and for carbonated rocks, it was presumed that the Rb content is extremely low, giving a Rb\/Sr ratio close to zero; therefore it was assumed that the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of these samples did not significantly evolve during the last 160\u00a0Ma (Table 1).\n\n\n\n4\nSr isotope compositions of altered rocks from the Platta nappe\n\n4.1\nFe-Ca silicates in veins and pervasively replacing serpentinites\nThe Sr isotope ratios of Fe-Ca silicates range from 0.70592 to 0.70785 with an average composition close to the value of Jurassic seawater (\n\n\u223c\n\n0.7068, n \u00a0=\u00a012, Fig. 3\n). At Kanonensattel, Fe-Ca silicates that pervasively replaced serpentine are more radiogenic than those from Cotschen (mean values of 0.70708 and 0.70648, respectively, Table 1). At Cotschen, Fe-Ca silicates occurring as pervasive replacement are slightly more radiogenic than those in veins crosscutting serpentinites (0.70676 and 0.70621, respectively Table 1).\n\n\n4.2\nCarbonates veins and shear bands in serpentinites and basalts\nThe 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of carbonates are centered around 0.70668 (n \u00a0=\u00a015; Table 1), close to the value of Jurassic seawater (Fig. 3). The carbonated rocks from Falotta display Sr isotope ratios comprised between 0.70624 and 0.70729, with a mean value of 0.70684, while carbonates from Cotschen are less radiogenic (0.70645 in average). Carbonates from Marmorera exhibit low Sr isotope ratios, with maximum at 0.70548. Carbonate veins in serpentinites show the highest variability of Sr isotope compositions, ranging from 0.70419 to 0.70729, with a mean value slightly below the Jurassic seawater (0.70640, Table 1). At Falotta, discrete carbonate veins in serpentinites display Sr isotope ratios higher than their equivalents in mafic rocks (0.70706 vs. 0.70665, respectively) or than carbonated shear bands in serpentinites (0.70686, Table 1). At Marmorera, carbonates in pervasive replacement of serpentinites display lower Sr isotope ratios than calcite veins in serpentinites (0.70468 and 0.70484, respectively, Table 1).\n\n\n4.3\nSerpentinites\nSerpentinites are characterized by 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of 0.70394 to 0.7939, values that range between those of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle and the mean value of the continental crust (Fig. 3). Numerous samples display Sr isotope ratios higher than the Jurassic seawater. As for carbonate veins, part of the isotope heterogeneity seems to be related to the structural position along the margin: serpentinites from the Upper Platta (proximal part of the paleo-margin) have higher 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.70783 in average, n \u00a0=\u00a010) than those from the Lower Platta (0.70741, n \u00a0=\u00a014). In the latter, the less radiogenic sample is from Marmorera (0.70394), while serpentinites from Kanonensattel and Cotschen have similar and relatively high Sr isotope ratios (0.70717 in average; Table 1), close to the value of Jurassic seawater. In Falotta (Lower Platta), the Sr isotope ratios of serpentinites are more heterogenous, with a mean value of 0.70741 (n \u00a0=\u00a010, Table 1), higher than the Jurassic seawater. In addition, green serpentine veins (0.70832 in average) are characterized by higher Sr isotope compositions than serpentinites forming the groundmass (0.70717 in average).\n\n\n4.4\nMafic rocks\nThe Sr isotope ratios of mafic rocks are consistent with those available in the literature (Stille et al., 1989; Schaltegger et al., 2002; Amann, 2017; Supplementary material). They range between the Jurassic seawater and the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (0.70181 to 0.70641; Fig. 3). The mafic rocks from Marmorera (87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.70400) have Sr isotope ratios lower than other samples from the Lower Platta (0.70603 in average), consistent with what is described for carbonates and serpentinites. Intrusive rocks display 87Sr\/86Sr ratios lower than those for basalts (0.70351 and 0.70551 in average, respectively, Table 1). Extrusive rocks display quite homogenous Sr isotope compositions regardless of their alteration (i.e., epidotization or chloritization), with a slightly less radiogenic composition for epidotized basalts when compared to chloritized basalts (0.70524 and 0.70606, respectively, Table 1).\n\n\n4.5\nRodingites and blackwalls\nRodingites and blackwalls display 87Sr\/86Sr ratios between 0.70345 and 0.70641 (see Supplementary material online), overlapping those of mafic rocks (Fig. 3). Rodingites display more radiogenic Sr compositions than blackwalls (0.70589, n \u00a0=\u00a06 and 0.70440, n \u00a0=\u00a04, respectively).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nMultiple Sr reservoirs involved during seafloor hydrothermalism in Ocean Continent Transition\nRegardless the timing of the different hydrothermal alterations reported in the Platta nappe, the Sr isotope compositions of the altered rocks highlight that different Sr contributors were involved during hydrothermalism. The Sr isotope compositions of Fe-Ca silicates and carbonates are centered around the Jurassic seawater value (Fig. 3). This suggests that seawater was the main contributor of strontium for these two lithologies, assuming that isotopic equilibrium was achieved. This is consistent with the development of ophicalcites within serpentinites close to the seafloor (Weissert and Bernoulli, 1984), and\/or thanks to the infiltration of seawater during the syntectonic carbonation along the detachment fault and the serpentinite-basalt contact as evidenced by homogeneous stable \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nO and \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\nC signatures of carbonates in the Falotta area (Coltat et al., 2019).\nBy contrast with other hydrothermal alteration products, many serpentinites display Sr isotope compositions significantly higher than the Jurassic seawater. This implies that the fluids responsible for serpentinization previously interacted with the continental crust, the latter reservoir being significantly more radiogenic than Jurassic seawater (Fig. 3). Hence, serpentinization of the sub-continental mantle occurred before its exhumation at the seafloor. A similar interpretation was proposed recently for serpentinization of mantle rocks in the Apennines (Schwarzenbach et al., 2021).\nThe Sr isotope compositions of altered mafic rocks (i.e., epidotized and chloritized basalts) are slightly higher than those of fresh gabbros (Table 1). This observation can hardly be attributed to different magmatic parental sources since structural and geochemical relationships between intrusive and extrusive mafic rocks in the Platta nappe indicate they share a common genetic origin (Epin et al., 2019; Amann et al., 2020). Consequently, we consider that the higher 87Sr\/86Sr compositions of extrusive mafic rocks result from the interaction with seawater at higher fluid\/rock ratios than for gabbros, which is similar to previous work (e.g., Burke et al., 1982; Rampone et al., 1998). This inference is confirmed by the calculated percentage of Sr isotopic exchanged and fluid\/rock ratios (Table 1). As the Jurassic seawater has a higher Sr isotope ratio than the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, intense alteration implying seawater circulation interacting with mafic rocks would ultimately lead to an increase of the Sr isotope compositions of the altered rocks.\nAs for mafic rocks, the Sr isotope compositions of rodingites and blackwalls range between the sub-continental lithospheric mantle value and that of Jurassic seawater (Fig. 3), suggesting here again that the source of Sr predominantly derives from these two reservoirs during the hydrothermal alteration of mafic rocks. Rodingites and blackwalls have higher 87Sr\/86Sr ratios than mafic rocks, which might also be explained by a more intense alteration highlighted by high Sr isotope exchange (Supplementary material). The involvement of modified seawater or different magmatic sources is an unlikely scenario that is discarded here. Indeed, in the rodingites from Falotta, which display the highest Sr isotope compositions (up to 0.7068), primary minerals are completely replaced by secondary minerals (chlorite, grossular, diopside Amann, 2017). Besides, it is widely accepted that rodingites are formed by successive interactions between mafic rocks and fluids released after serpentinization reactions (e.g., Coleman, 1967; Frost, 1975; Evans, 1977; Palandri and Reed, 2004; Panseri et al., 2008; Bach and Klein, 2009; Salvioli-Mariani et al., 2020). As shown earlier, some serpentinites have more radiogenic Sr isotope compositions than Jurassic seawater, especially at Falotta. Consequently, serpentinization-derived fluids reacting with mafic rocks would likely confer to rodingites and associated blackwalls higher Sr isotope compositions than those of the parental magmatic protolith.\n\n\n5.2\nMineral textures as a proxy of fluid\/rock ratios during hydrothermal alteration\nThe fluid\/rock ratios prevailing during alteration can be calculated using the Sr isotope compositions of the altered rocks following the procedure describe in Delacour et al. (2008). Besides the isotopic variability explained by sourcing distinct reservoirs in variable amounts, some of the variability observed for a given lithology (dispersion of histograms; Fig. 3) seems to be directly related to mineral textures, especially for Fe-Ca silicate minerals from Cotschen. The minerals in veins are less radiogenic than those in pervasive replacement of serpentinites (Table 1). This may relate to variable fluid\/rock ratios and\/or variable modes of secondary mineral formation during hydrothermal alteration (replacement vs. open-space infilling). This suggests close relationships between the replacement process and the resulting Sr isotope compositions. During hydrothermal alteration, the Sr isotope composition of secondary minerals is related to the amount of fluid available and its capacity to percolate into the rock. When large amounts of fluid are available (i.e., high fluid\/rock ratio), the Sr isotope composition of the fluid remains unchanged during interaction with the country rocks and consequently, secondary minerals will record the isotopic signature of this fluid. On the contrary, if the amount of fluid available is low (i.e., low fluid\/rock ratio), the initial Sr isotope composition of the fluid is modified during fluid\/rock interactions and thus secondary minerals will record these fluid\/rock interactions.\nIn cases where a large quantity of seawater was available, pervasive replacement of primary minerals occurred, and the resulting Sr isotope compositions of altered rocks are close to the value of seawater (Fig. 3). The initial Sr isotope compositions of protoliths, i.e., serpentinites both for Fe-Ca silicate minerals and carbonates, were erased during intense interaction with Jurassic seawater.\nConversely, if small amounts of seawater were involved, discrete veins preferentially formed, yielding Sr isotope compositions which were not buffered by seawater but rather preserved the ones of the primary host rocks. For instance, at Cotschen, the Fe-Ca silicate minerals produced during pervasive replacement of serpentinites display Sr isotope compositions close to that of Jurassic seawater (\n\n\u223c\n\n0.70676) and very large Sr isotope exchange (from 84 to 100 %), whereas isolated Fe-Ca silicate veins in serpentinites have slightly lower Sr isotope compositions (\n\n\u223c\n\n0.70621) and lower Sr isotope exchange (from 75 to 87 %). This supports the hypothesis of Coltat et al. (2019), who proposed that the fluid\/rock ratio increased from the outer zone (i.e., host serpentinites) where discrete veining occurred in the stockwork to the inner zone (i.e., Cu-rich massive sulfides) where Fe-Ca silicate minerals pervasively replaced the serpentinites.\nAs for Fe-Ca silicates, the textural variability of the carbonates at Falotta seems to control the Sr isotope compositions of altered rocks. Coltat et al. (2019) inferred that an infinite isotopic reservoir was available during the formation of thick foliated ophicalcites (\n\n\u223c\n\n10\u00a0m). Fracture-filling carbonates, which formed under lower fluid\/rock ratios than those prevailing for foliated ophicalcites, have higher Sr isotope compositions than the latter (0.70706 and 0.70686, respectively, Table 1). The percentage of Sr exchange calculated is about 96 % for foliated ophicalcites. This supports the idea that the textural variability of altered rocks is controlled by variations of the fluid\/rock ratio during hydrothermal alteration, leading to distinct Sr isotope compositions of the secondary minerals. Where the fluid\/rock ratio was high, secondary minerals recorded the Sr isotope composition of the fluid solely (i.e., seawater), whereas at low fluid\/rock ratio, they recorded interactions between the hydrothermal fluid and the surrounding rocks (i.e., acquiring intermediate Sr isotope compositions between those of the fluid and the surrounding rocks). Similarly, Schwarzenbach et al. (2021) have measured Sr and stable isotopes in calcite veins in ophicalcites from Apennine ophiolites, and proposed that carbonation resulted from extensive seawater circulation.\nA different trend is recorded by serpentinites. At Falotta, the serpentine veins are more radiogenic than the groundmass of serpentines with mesh texture (0.70898 and 0.70756, respectively, Table 1). Mesh formation requires very low fluid\/rock ratios and supports a diffusion process in a roughly closed system (where the amount of fluid is limited; Viti and Mellini, 1998; Evans, 2004; Andreani et al., 2007). In contrast, vein formation corresponds to higher fluid\/rock ratios, especially during the latest vein formation in an open system near the seafloor (Andreani et al., 2007). The serpentine veins were formed after interaction with seawater that previously percolated through the continental crust. The oxygen isotope compositions measured in late serpentine veins from the Platta nappe by Fr\u00fch-Green et al. (1990), are consistent with interaction with metamorphic fluids channelized along discrete brittle fractures and at grain boundaries in a rock-dominated system. More recently, Schwarzenbach et al. (2021) proposed that hydrogen isotopes compositions measured in serpentinites from the Apennine ophiolites resulted of a seafloor process and interaction with an evolved seawater-derived fluid. In the absence of evidence of metamorphic overprint in the area and in line with our results, we argue that this latter explanation is the most plausible.\n\n\n5.3\nHydrothermal alteration during the final rifting and breakup of the Platta nappe\nPart of the isotopic variability in serpentinites cannot be explained by variations of the fluid\/rock ratios nor by mineral textures, e.g., the wide disparities in the groundmass serpentinites between sites (Table 1). Serpentinites in a more continentward position (Upper Platta) have 87Sr\/86Sr ratios higher than serpentinites from a more oceanward position (Lower Platta; Table 1). For mafic rocks, epidotized basalts from Marmorera (distal domain) are less radiogenic than those from Falotta (distal domain; Table 1). Moreover, at Falotta, epidotized basalts recorded a higher Sr isotope exchange and fluid\/rock ratio than those at Marmorera (Table 1). Therefore, the contribution of the Sr reservoirs likely evolved with the position along the margin and thus a change in the nature and the proportion of the Sr contributors during the margin formation may be inferred.\nSerpentinization of mantle rocks resulted from the interaction of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle with hydrothermal fluids (Table 1; Fig. 3) that previously interacted with the continental crust. During rifting, the continental crust was progressively thinned due to the interplay between brittle detachment faulting in upper crustal level and ductile shearing in middle and lower crustal levels (Mohn et al., 2012). Hence, before reacting with mantle rocks, seawater likely percolated through the permeable faults and interacted with crustal rocks (Incerpi et al., 2020). In a later stage of rifting, shear zone allowed to thin the crust less than 10\u00a0km and completely brittle, enabling faults and fluids to penetrate across the residual thinned crust into the mantle initiating serpentinization. At a following stage, mantle was exhumed to the seafloor by in and out of sequence detachment systems, whereby domains near the crust experienced contamination by continent-derived Sr, while this contamination decreased oceanward. This led to the Sr isotope gradient observed in serpentinites with lower Sr isotope compositions oceanward. Hence, a significant part of the isotopic heterogeneity of serpentinites is likely due to long-term serpentinization reactions during extensional tectonics, from the hyperextension phase to the exhumation phase (i.e., creation of the distal domain).\nTo a lesser extent, the position along the margin may also have influenced the Sr isotope compositions of carbonated rocks. Indeed, samples from Falotta (Fig. 1B) display higher Sr isotope compositions than carbonated rocks from the more oceanward Cotschen and Marmorera domains. This could be explained by higher Sr isotope compositions of the host rocks at Falotta than at Marmorera-Cotschen (i.e., serpentinites Table 1; Fig. 3). Hence, during carbonation, at a given fluid\/rock ratio, the seawater that would have interacted with serpentinites having higher Sr isotope ratios at Falotta than at Marmorera-Cotschen likely formed carbonates with higher Sr isotope compositions at Falotta.\n\n\n5.4\nTiming of the hydrothermal alteration at the Marmorera-Cotschen Hydrothermal System\nAll the points discussed above allow to propose a timing for the hydrothermal alteration and formation of the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal plumbing system (Fig. 4\n). In the Platta nappe hydrothermal alteration story, the serpentinization of mantle rocks was the first event (Fig. 4, stage1). It started during the hyperextension phase of the rifting, when the sub-continental lithospheric mantle was still capped by a thinned continental crust (less than 10\u00a0km thick), forming the highly radiogenic serpentinites (Fig. 3; Table 1). Serpentinization continued after mantle rocks exhumation at the seafloor (i.e., formation of the Ocean Continent Transition after continental breakup), leading to the interaction between mantle rocks and isotopically pristine seawater that circulated along the detachment faults (Fig. 4, stage 2).\nMantle exhumation was accompanied by the emplacement of mafic magmatism (Desmurs et al., 2002; Epin et al., 2019; Amann et al., 2020). Extrusive rocks were emplaced onto an active exhumation fault and were further altered during hydrothermal circulations, leading to epidotization, chloritization and late carbonation at the serpentinite-basalt interface (Coltat et al., 2019; Coltat et al., 2020). Rodingitization and associated blackwalls formed synchronously to the serpentinization of mantle rocks, through a diffusional metasomatism process between serpentinized-derived fluids and mafic rocks, such as described in Bach and Klein (2009) (Fig. 4, stage 2). Here again, the heterogenous Sr isotope compositions of rodingites and blackwalls are consistent with long-term fluid\/rock interactions and multi-stage infiltration of fluids (Salvioli-Mariani et al., 2020). The fluids released during the rodingitization of mafic rocks migrated upwards and likely interacted with serpentinization-derived fluids and isotopically unmodified seawater to form Fe-Ca silicate minerals and late carbonates (Fig. 4, stage 3 and 4, respectively).\nThe Sr isotope compositions of Fe-Ca silicate minerals and carbonated rocks are centered around the value of seawater, especially those at Cotschen (Fig. 3). The homogeneity of Sr isotope ratios and the large Sr exchange suggest short-lived fluid circulations under high fluid\/rock ratios. Based on oxygen isotope compositions of ophicalcites, a similar interpretation was proposed by Coltat et al. (2019) at the Falotta site (Lower Platta Unit) and in the Apennine ophiolites (Schwarzenbach et al., 2021). Consistently, in our model, carbonation of mafic rocks and serpentinites was the latest hydrothermal event in the story. It is assumed to have occurred in high-permeability zones like the basalt-serpentinites interface during the mixing between seawater and uprising hydrothermal fluids. Towards the seafloor, the seawater component became more predominant (Fig. 4, stage 4).\n\n\n5.5\nConsequences for the formation of ultramafic-hosted metal deposits\nThe Sr isotope compositions of Fe-Ca silicates accompanying mineralization in the Platta nappe are consistent with a contribution from the surrounding magmatic rocks (altered mafic and ultramafic rocks) but also from seawater (Fig. 4D). The latter was also involved in metal precipitation (e.g. Co, Cu, Ni, Zn), during mixing with the hydrothermal fluid, as proposed for the Rainbow hydrothermal field (Debret et al., 2018) and the fossil Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system (Coltat et al., 2021). However, it is unlikely that metals derived from seawater itself, even considering large fluid\/rock ratios, since seawater contains infinitesimal proportions of metals compared to the surrounding rocks (e.g., Fouquet et al., 2013 and references therein). Rather, we propose that the main part of the metal stock involved for the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system mineralization derived from the surrounding rocks (serpentinites and mafic rocks) with minor involvement of seawater.\nBased on S and Pb isotope geochemistry of ultramafic-hosted mineralizations, a similar scenario was proposed to explain metal enrichments at oceanic hydrothermal systems (Zeng et al., 2017). These authors indicate that the contribution of seawater-derived sulfur taking part to mineralized systems was less than 36 %, whereas on the basis of Pb isotope compositions it was argued that lead solely derived from the surrounding magmatic rocks. In addition, Debret et al. (2018) recently investigated the Fe, Cu and Zn systematics of barren and mineralized rocks from the ultramafic-hosted Rainbow hydrothermal system (MAR). They showed that serpentinization of mantle rocks was responsible for metal leaching from the parental peridotite (e.g., decreasing of metal concentrations from peridotite to serpentinite). Mantle rocks may thus represent a major contributor for metals involved in the formation of ultramafic-hosted mineralized systems.\nFinally, the results from the present study highlight that the formation of ultramafic-hosted mineralized systems depends on the availability of both mafic and ultramafic reservoirs to extract metals that form economic mineralization enriched in base (Cu, Ni, Zn), critical (Co) and precious (Au) metals, similar to what is observed in present-day systems (Fouquet et al., 2013). Recently, a review of fossil ultramafic-hosted mineralized systems preserved on-land has been proposed (Patten et al., 2021). The main results are that: i) these systems are not scarce but rather represent a self-standing sub-group of the so-called volcanogenic massive sulfides (VMS) deposits, ii) they form in complex tectonic environments preserved in the geological record (e.g., ocean-continent transition, mid-oceanic ridge, supra-subduction zone), iii) they present specific alteration and deformation features (i.e. associated with serpentinites, carbonated mantle rocks and talc-chlorite-tremolite schists along extensional structures generally at the contact between mantle rocks and overlying mafic and\/or sedimentary rocks), and iv) according to the Zipf\u2019s law, many deposits are still undiscovered. Although a genetic model is still missing for ultramafic-hosted VMS deposits, in which the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system belongs, our study, focused on the Sr isotope systematics, demonstrates that mafic and ultramafic reservoirs are important components that control the formation of polymetallic deposits. Similar mineralized systems have been reported at the contact between mantle and sedimentary rocks (e.g., Bouvier et al., 1990; Peltonen et al., 2008), implying that mafic rocks are not a prerequisite to produce ultramafic-hosted metal deposits. Further studies are needed to produce a proper genetic model for ultramafic-hosted VMS, especially concerning their relationships with the different hydrothermal alterations and the seafloor-related extensional tectonics, but this model will likely be implemented by Sr isotope investigations.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn the Platta nappe, the Fe-Ca silicates (87Sr\/86Sr \u00a0=\u00a00.70668) and associated mineral deposits (the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal system, of late Middle Jurassic age) formed through intense leaching of surrounding mafic and ultramafic rocks during interactions with seawater (87Sr\/86Sr \u00a0=\u00a00.70628, this value being estimated using the most carbonated serpentines, i.e., the foliated ophicalcites). The Sr isotope compositions and textural features of altered rocks allowed to reconstruct the timing of the hydrothermal alteration and formation of the Marmorera-Cotschen hydrothermal plumbing system. The Sr isotope compositions of serpentinites recorded multiple and long-time fluid\/rock interactions. In particular, the involvement of seawater is demonstrated, both during early stage (hyperextension phase) for which it interacted with continental crust and during late exhumation stage (mantle exhumation at the seafloor) during which it mixed with serpentinization-derived fluids. Obviously, the involvement of seawater became dominant during serpentinization and carbonation near the paleo-seafloor. Mafic rocks also recorded multiple fluid histories, involving variable amounts of hydrothermal fluids, leading to a diversity of Sr isotope compositions (from 0.70334 to 0.70624). In contrast, the Fe-Ca silicates and the ophicalcites mostly recorded latest stages of fluid\/rock interactions dominated by seawater under high fluid\/rock ratios. Rather than giving a straightforward information on the source of the metals present in ultramafic-hosted oceanic deposits, the Sr systematics thus helps identify the reservoirs involved in the mineralization and constrain the plumbing system through which mineralization occurred.\n\n","33":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAs one of the most important Au geochemical provinces in China, the Jiaodong Au province contains more than 150 gold deposits and 5000\u00a0t of proven Au resources (Wang et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2020). The genesis of the Jiaodong gold deposits is still under debate and has been the subject of many studies in the past few decades (Zhai et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2002, 2008; Fan et al., 2005, 2021; Chen et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2013; Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014; Li et al., 2015; Groves and Santosh, 2016; Li and Santosh, 2017; Deng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a). The consensus on the genesis of the Jiaodong gold deposit is that the Au-rich ore-forming fluid derives from a down-going subduction slab and overlying pyrite-rich sediment wedge, and\/or metasomatized mantle lithosphere related to subduction in the Early Cretaceous (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014; Deng et al., 2020; Yang and Santosh, 2020). The ore-forming fluid is characterized as low-medium temperature (200\u2013400 \u2103), low salinity (0\u201310\u00a0wt% NaCl eq.) and high CO2 content (4\u201325\u00a0mol.%); water\/rock reaction (sulfidation) and phase separation act as the main metallogenic mechanisms (Song et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2021). Phase separation has been verified by numerous studies on the gold deposits in the Jiaodong area (Z.F. Yang et al., 1994; L.Q. Yang et al., 2014, 2016; Wang et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2017; Chai et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021). Traditional evidence of the presence of phase separation has been provided by fluid inclusion studies (Yang et al., 2013; Chai et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016). In recent years, new technologies (e.g., SIMS sulfur isotopic analyses and NanoSIMS mapping) provide opportunities to conduct detailed studies on ore-related pyrite, and the obtained pyrite textures and compositions, such as oscillatory zoning and relatively consistent \u03b434S values from pyrite bands, also indicate the presence of phase separation (Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021).\nPhase separation of ore-forming fluid due to a sharp decrease in pressure is considered as an important factor in mineralization processes of polymetallic sulfide deposits in the upper levels of Earth\u2019s crust (Sibson, 1987; Bowers, 1991; Robb, 2005). It controls fluid chemistry due to partitioning of chemical species and dramatically changes the prevailing conditions under which metal\u2013ligand complexes are stable resulting in metal precipitation from ore-forming solutions. First, the boiling away of an aqueous vapor from a hydrothermal fluid results in the residual enrichment of the solute (Robb, 2005). Second, the escape of acidic volatile components (e.g. Hg, CO2, HCl, H2S and SO2) not only causes a decrease in the total activities of S and Cl in ore-forming fluids, which destabilizes Au complexes (Yang et al., 1994; Witt, 1996; Hodkiewicz et al., 2009; Pokrovski et al., 2008, Pokrovski et al., 2014), but also turns the residual solution more alkaline which has a significant effect on the solubility of dissolved species (Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985; Butterfield et al., 1990, 1994; Robb, 2005; Suzuki et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2016). In a typical Cl- and S-bearing fluid, Au solubility is minimal at near-neutral pH while solubilities of polymetallic sulfides (Fe, Cu, and Zn) decrease dramatically with increasing pH over the natural range (pH: 3\u20139) (Pokrovski et al., 2014). Furthermore, some metals experience strong partitioning between the liquid and vapor phases (Heinrich et al., 1999; Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005; Seo et al., 2009; Pokrovski et al., 2008, 2013, 2014; Zezin et al., 2011; Zajacz et al., 2017). Analyses of vapor released from volcanic fumaroles and vapor inclusions in ore deposits have verified the vapor transport of metals, which may be responsible for the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits (Fulignati and Sbrana, 1998; Audetat et al., 1998; Ulrich et al., 1999; Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005; Larocque et al., 2008; Mavrogenes et al., 2010; Kouzmanov and Pokrovski, 2012; Zelenski et al., 2013; Pokrovski et al., 2005, 2009a, Pokrovski et al., 2009b, Pokrovski et al., 2013; Chaplygin et al., 2015a, Chaplygin et al., 2015b; Kokh et al., 2017; Shevko et al., 2018; Tombros and Fitros, 2019). As summarized by Williams-Jones and Heinrich (2005), B, Cu, As, Sb, Au, and possibly Li tend to partition into the vapor phase of fluid inclusions, relative to Na. Fumarole condensates are rich in Cl, Re, Se, B, S, Au, Ag, and Pt (Pokrovski et al., 2013). For Au-bearing fluids, neutral and less polar Au-S\/Cl complexes and Au-bearing nanoparticles tend to partition into the gas phase during phase separation under certain conditions (Pankratz et al., 1987a, Pankratz et al., 1987b; Archibald et al., 2001; Zezin et al., 2007, 2011; Pokrovski et al., 2008, 2014; Seo et al., 2009; X.Q. Wang et al., 2012, 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; G.Q. Wang et al., 2019).\nThere is no doubt that phase separation has a significant impact on primary halo zonation and consequently is vital for geochemical exploration. In this study, 460 soil samples and 1130 borehole samples were collected from the Qujia gold deposit. This allows us to explore the mineralization process based on the spatial distributions and correlations of Au, S, Cl, Hg, Fe2O3, Cu, Pb, and Bi. Among them, Au is an ore-forming element, Hg is a traditional pathfinder for Au exploration, and S and Cl have significant impacts on Au migration and precipitation.\n\n\n2\nRegional and deposit geology\nThe Jiaodong Au province, one of the largest gold producers worldwide, is located along the southeastern margin of the North China Craton. It is bounded by the Su-Lu ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic belt to the south and the NE- to NNE-trending Tan-Lu fault zone to the west (Fig. 1\n). Exposed rocks in the area consist of metamorphosed Precambrian basement sequences (Jiaodong, Jingshan, Fenzishan and Penglai Groups) and widespread Mesozoic intrusive and volcanic rocks (Zhou and L\u00fc, 2000; Mao et al., 2008; Zhai and Santosh, 2013; Zhou et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2012). The widespread Mesozoic granitoids in the Jiaodong gold province are traditionally divided into the Linglong, Guojialing, and Aishan Suites (Zhang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2016), with the Linglong and Guojialing Suites hosting most of the gold deposits (Fan et al., 2003; Li et al., 2006; Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014) (Fig. 1). Gold deposits in the area are categorized into \u201cJiaojia-type\u201d and \u201cLinglong-type\u201d (Qiu et al., 1988). The \u201cJiaojia-type\u201d gold deposits are characterized by disseminated and stockwork-style pyrite-sericite-quartz-altered ores controlled by major regional-scale faults such as the Sanshandao, Jiaojia and Xincheng faults (Shen et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2002; Li et al., 2020a). The \u201cLinglong-type\u201d deposits are characterized by single or multiple quartz veins along the secondary faults that cut the Mesozoic granitoids (Miao et al., 1997; Fan et al., 2003). The Jiaojia-type gold deposits occupy more than 80% of the gold resources in the Jiaodong gold province (Fan et al., 2003; Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014).\nThe Qujia gold deposit is located in the middle section of the Jiaojia gold metallogenic belt, the densest metallogenic structure belt in Jiaodong (Fig. 1), and is a deep extension of the Xincheng and Matang gold deposits (Yang et al., 2020a, Yang et al., 2020b). The Qujia gold deposit is controlled by the NNE-NEE-trending JJF. The JJF in the study area varies from 800\u00a0m to 1800\u00a0m in depth, and the depth increases from southeast to northwest. A large number of secondary faults, joints, fissures, and mineralized alteration zones have developed on both sides of the main fault. Quaternary units in the Qujia area are widely distributed. They include the alluvial deposits of riverbed and floodplain facies distributed along modern rivers and marine deposits distributed along modern coasts. Below the Quaternary sediments, there are Late Jurassic Linglong Monzogranite, Early Cretaceous Guojialing Granodiorite and Neoarchean metagabbro. The specific study area is located southwest of the Qujia gold deposit, and it is covered by Quaternary sediments with thicknesses ranging from 1.50 to 29.60\u00a0m, although thicknesses are usually 5.00 to 10.00\u00a0m (Fig. 2\n). In addition, the thicknesses of the Quaternary sediments generally increase from southeast to northwest. The host rock (wall rock) that has undergone mineralization-related alterations is the Linglong Monzogranite (Yang et al., 2020a). The predominant ore-forming element in the ore is Au with associated components of Ag and S. The ore minerals are mainly pyrite, and small amounts of chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. The gangue minerals consist of feldspar, quartz, sericite and chlorite. The alteration closely related to Au mineralization is beresitization (Yang et al., 2020a).\n\n\n3\nSamples and methods\nThe dataset included 460 soil samples and 1130 borehole core samples. The soil geochemical data and part of the borehole data were published by Wang et al. (2021b). Sampling methods can be found in (Wang et al., 2021b). A fine-grained soil prospecting method was adopted for surface geochemical exploration, which has been verified by many case studies and applications (Wang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018a, Liu et al., 2018b; Han et al., 2020a, Han et al., 2020b). Gold was detected by the graphite furnace atomic absorption method with a detection limit of 0.2\u00a0ng\/g. Mercury was detected by atomic fluorescence spectrometry analysis with a detection limit of 3\u00a0ng\/g. Sulfur was detected by the combustion iodometric method with a detection limit of 40\u00a0\u03bcg\/g. Chlorine was detected by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with a detection limit of 7\u00a0\u03bcg\/g.\nMicromine for Windows was used to conduct the 3D modeling. 3D modeling can integrate data of different scales, including points (single soil or core geochemical data), lines (boreholes and exploration lines), and 2D maps (cross-sections, geochemical maps, etc.). Thereby, we can understand more clearly the spatial distribution characteristics of geological and geochemical attributes (e.g., faults, alteration zones, element content, etc.) and their correlation more clearly. The process of Micromine-based 3D modeling is briefly described as follows: work in Micromine starts with opening a new project; then a drill hole database is created by importing various data; a wireframe is created based on the spatial distribution of drill holes; the geological ore bodies models and spatial distributions of elements, which represent the process of creating solid shapes with the wireframe data type, are interpolated using the inverse distance weighted method with an elliptical search neighborhood based on the drill hole data. The 3D grid cell size adopted in this study is 20\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0m. 4. Results.\n\n3.1\nDescriptive statistics\nThe statistics of Au, S, Cl, Hg, Fe2O3, Cu, Pb, and Bi of the borehole rock geochemical data are shown in Table 1\n. The intensive and superimposed Au mineralization in Jiaodong make ore-forming and associated elements highly enriched (Wang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2019). For example, the Au content corresponding to the 60th percentile is as high as 2.0\u00a0ng\/g which is more than twice that of the Au abundance (0.9\u00a0ng\/g) in the continental crust in the eastern part of China (Chi and Yan, 2007). As indicators of element enrichment and dispersion characteristics, the higher values of coefficient of variation (CV\u00a0=\u00a0SD\/mean; SD\u00a0=\u00a0standard deviation) and enrichment factor (EF\u00a0=\u00a0mean\/NCP; NCP\u00a0=\u00a0elemental abundance of monzogranites in the North China platform [Chi and Yan, 2007]) of a certain element are, the closer the element\u2019s correlation with mineralization is. Gold concentrations range from 0.1\u00a0ng\/g to 10800.0\u00a0ng\/g, with mean value of 47.3\u00a0ng\/g. Obviously, Au has extremely high CV and EF values (7.92 and 115.37, respectively), which is consistent with the fact that Au is an ore-forming element. Sulfur, Hg, Cu, Pb, and Bi have high CV and EF values suggesting that they are potential associated elements. In comparison, Cl has relatively low CV (0.89) and EF (0.79) values. It appears that Cl may have little correlation with Au mineralization. Similarly, Fe2O3 also have low CV (0.5) and EF (0.45) values which is contradictory to the fact that Au mineralization is closely related to the beresitization.\nThe Q\u2013Q plots of the raw data were drawn (Fig. 3\n) and illustrated that there were some outliers in the datasets. Consequently, the geochemical data are not normally distributed. In this study, 75th, 85th, and 95th percentiles were adopted as the lower thresholds for low, medium and high anomalies.\n\n\n3.2\nScatter plot analysis\nBased on all the borehole data, scatter plots of Au, S, Cl, Hg, Fe2O3, Cu, Pb, and Bi (Fig. 4\n), and their concentration variations with depth (Fig. 5\n) were constructed to preliminarily determine correlations. There are positive correlations between Au vs. S and Au vs. Bi (Fig. 4). Ore samples (Au\u00a0\u2265\u00a01000\u00a0ng\/g) are always accompanied by high S and Bi anomalies indeed, and some altered samples (especially 10\u00a0ng\/g\u00a0\u2264\u00a0Au\u00a0\u2264\u00a01000\u00a0ng\/g) are also accompanied by high S and Bi anomalies (Fig. 4a). Medium-to-high anomalies of Au and S are distributed in the depth interval from 600 to 1250\u00a0m, though they were mainly distributed from 1000 to 1200\u00a0m (Fig. 5). The variation characteristics of Au, S, and Bi in the ore-bearing boreholes indicate that S and Bi are highly related to the Au mineralization because the altered and ore samples are characterized by medium-to-high S anomalies (Fig. 6\n).\nThere is no correlation between Au and Cl, as illustrated by the scatter plot Au versus Cl (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The ore samples are characterized by low-to-medium Cl anomalies (Fig. 4). Chlorine enrichment zones were formed directly above the ore bodies compared with the Cl contents in the ore samples and wall rock (Figs. 6\u20138\n\n). In the other words, Cl escaped from the ore-forming fluid during Au mineralization and immediately precipitated above the ore bodies. Therefore, Cl is likely related to Au mineralization although there is little direct correlation between Au and Cl.\nGold and Hg have subtle correlations. The ore samples are accompanied by low-to-medium Hg anomalies and even no Hg anomalies (Fig. 4). However, samples near the ore bodies and altered samples with medium-to-high Au anomalies in the deep part are characterized by high Hg anomalies (Fig. 5). Regular distributions are observed in the ore-bearing boreholes. Mercury depletion zones with a top depth of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0700\u00a0m appear above the ore bodies 1 and 3. The Hg content generally increases from a depth of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0700\u00a0m to the surface (Figs. 6\u20138).\nNotably, Fe2O3 and Au have no correlations because some samples with low Au contents have extremely high Fe2O3 contents. But Fe2O3 and Au are positively correlated if some high Fe2O3 contents were excluded, which is also supported by the correlation that the samples with S\u00a0greater than\u00a00.5 (wt. %) are characterized by elevated Fe2O3 contents (Fig. 4). More apparently, the ore samples have high Fe2O3 contents in the ore-bearing wells (Figs. 6-8). The high Fe2O3 contents in the shallow part of the ZK3\u2032-07 is due to the presence of biotite-plagioclase granulite which also causes the extremely high Cu and relatively low Pb contents. The element vertical distributions of ore-bearing wells all suggest altered and ore samples are characterized by elevated Fe2O3, Cu, and Bi although they are not positively correlated to Au. By comparison, elevated Pb contents only appears in the ore samples of the ZK1-11; instead, the ore samples have low Pb contents and high Pb contents appears above the ore bodies in the ZK3\u2032-07, ZK1-6, and ZK1-9 (Fig. 8).\n\n\n3.3\n3D geochemical patterns\nGeochemical patterns of Au, S, Cl, Hg, Fe2O3, Cu, Pb, and Bi, and their correlation in a 3D space (Figs. 9\u201311\n\n\n) were analyzed to reveal information vital for Au mineralization.\nAgain, the distributions of Au and S are highly consistent (Fig. 9a-f and Fig. 11a). The distributions of the Au and S anomalies are consistent, mainly along the JJF; sporadic Au and S anomalies appear in the hanging wall of the JJF due to secondary faults. The results indicate that the Au and S anomaly zones in the deep depths represent the distribution of the JJF although geophysical data are unavailable to determine the exact distribution of the JJF. Notably, the width of the anomaly zone is much larger than that of the JJF.\nThe Cl distribution is distinct from that of Au and S (Fig. 9g-i and Fig. 11b). At deep depths, Cl anomalies appear above the Au anomalies. Chlorine anomalies at the shallow depths are irregular and high Cl anomalies tend to be present near the surface.\nFe2O3 and Cu have similar spatial distribution (Fig. 10a-f and Fig. 11c-d). At shallow depths, their anomalies in the southeast of the study area are caused by the presence of biotite-plagioclase granulite, and other anomalies may be due to secondary enrichment under supergene weathering. Their medium-to-high anomalies are mainly distributed in the deep part of the JJF, and extend of medium-to-high Fe2O3 and Cu anomalies decrease towards the shallow part of the JJF. The spatial distribution of Pb is distinct from that of others (Figs. 9-10 and Fig. 11e). Medium-to-high Au and Pb are partly overlapped in the deep part of the JJF; to the shallow part of the JJF, medium-to-high Pb anomalies appear above the JJF rather than along it (Fig. 11e). The spatial distribution of Bi is quite similar to that of S (Fig. 10j-l and Fig. 11f).\nThe spatial distribution of Hg is considerably compelling (Fig. 9j-l and Fig. 12\n). In the deep depth along the JJF, Hg anomalies are far less continuous and smaller in scale than the Au anomalies. However, Hg anomalies are distributed in the traps indicating the spaces favorable to Au precipitation (No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 Hg anomalies). More importantly, Hg depletion zones appear above the ore bodies (e.g., ore bodies 1 and 3) and, subsequently, funnel-shaped Hg anomalies (No. 4 and No. 5 Hg anomalies) formed at shallow depths (Fig. 12).\nSoil geochemical data were then integrated into the 3D model (Fig. 12). The results show the presence of a high Hg anomaly and medium Au anomaly above ore body 1; and high Hg and Au anomalies above ore body 3. The Hg and Au anomalies above ore body 2 were caused by the weathering of nearby primary halos rather than the ore body 2. In addition, the intensities of Au and Hg anomalies in the soil are much higher than those of the borehole samples, especially Hg. Consequently, the formation of the ore bodies 1 and 3, rather than the ore body 2, could have caused Au and Hg anomalies to form in the near-surface medium above ore bodies 1 and 3, which is significant for geochemical exploration of deep concealed ore bodies.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nFactors affecting element geochemical patterns include temperature, pressure, pH, Eh, stability of complexes, activity of elements, fluid compositions, physicochemical characteristics of wall rock, fluid-rock interactions, and development of transportation channels (e.g., fractures, faults, unconformities) (Hawkes and Webb, 1962; Erickson et al., 1966; Huang et al., 1984; Li et al.,1995; Wang et al., 1997; Shao, 1997; Han et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2016). These factors can be further simplified into four categories: fluid, wall rock, fluid-wall rock interaction, and transportation channels. In the Qujia gold deposit, the dominant wall rock is Linglong Monzogranite, and the ore-forming fluid is characterized by low-medium temperatures (200\u2013400 \u2103), low salinities (0\u201310\u00a0wt% NaCl eq.) and a high CO2 content (4\u201325\u00a0mol.%) (Fan et al., 2021; Song et al., 2014). Therefore, the dominant factors controlling element geochemical patterns are fluid-wall rock interactions and transportation channels. The Au and S anomalies in deep depths indicate an ore-forming fluid transportation channel and intensive fluid-wall rock interactions along the JJF. The funnel-shaped Hg anomalies indicate the presence of vertical secondary faults or fracture zones. The ore bodies at the fault intersections, continuous medium-to-high Au and S anomalies (rather than Hg and Cl anomalies) in the JJF, and characteristic Hg and Cl anomalies (Hg depletion zone, Cl enrichment zone, and funnel-shaped Hg anomaly) with no or low Au and S anomalies in the secondary faults, and low iron content in the wall rock (Linglong Monzogranite) (Fe2O3 content: 1.22\u201310.82%, mean value: 1.91% [Yang et al., 2020a]) suggest the occurrence of phase separation. In the following sections, this study will elaborate on the geochemical behavioral characteristics of each element.\n\n4.1\nSignificance of S and Cl geochemical behavior in Au mineralization\nGold enrichment in S-rich fluids and sulfide melts can be attributed to Au\u2019s high affinity for reduced S (Heinrich et al, 1999; Simon et al., 2007; Seo et al., 2009; Botcharnikov et al., 2010; Pokrovski et al., 2008, 2014; Zajacz et al., 2017). Gold-S complexes are dominant in low-medium temperatures, low salinities, and S-rich fluids. The destabilization of Au\u2013S complexes and Au precipitation from ore-forming fluid is controlled by the availability of reduced S which is often determined by H2S release due to phase separation and the capacity of an Fe-bearing rock and\/or dissolved metals to scavenge reduced S form the fluid (Bowers, 1991; Cox et al., 1995; Mernagh and Bierlein, 2008; Mikucki, 1998; Naden and Shepherd, 1989; Zhang, 1997; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang and Zhu, 2016). In this study, most of the S in the ore-forming fluid precipitated with Au in the JJF. In other words, rather than partitioned into the gas phase, S mainly remained in the fluid phase during the phase separation; the same was true for Au. The partition of S in the liquid phase suggests that S in the ore-forming fluid is in the form of HS- instead of H2S and serve as ligands for Au complexes. The presence of S and Au anomalies near the surface only verified that a small amount of Au from the ore-forming fluid escaped to shallow depths. On the one hand, neutral and less polar Au-S (or Cl) complexes (e.g., AuHS0, AuHS(H2S)0, AuCl\u2219(H2O)5, AuCl\u2219(H2O)4, etc.) partition into the gas phase while charged complexes (e.g., Au(HS)2\n-, AuCl2\n-) tend to remain in the liquid phase (Pankratz et al., 1987a, Pankratz et al., 1987b; Archibald et al., 2001; Zezin et al., 2007, 2011; Pokrovski et al., 2008, 2014; Seo et al., 2009). On the other hand, Au-bearing nanoparticles can partition into the gas phase directly or absorb onto the surface of gas bubbles (X.Q. Wang et al., 2012, 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; G.Q. Wang et al., 2019).\nThe low iron content in the wall rock (Linglong Monzogranite) (Fe2O3 content: 1.22\u201310.82%, mean value: 1.91% [Yang et al., 2020a]) fails to support the wall-rock sulfidation as the primary control of Au destabilization and precipitation. Fluid-wall rock interactions were common and formed a large-scale alteration zone along the main fault. The thickness of the alteration zone can reach more than 500\u00a0m locally (Fig. 9), which is consistent with the results of Wang et al. (2020) and Yang et al. (2020). Consequently, the wall-rock sulfidation resulted in the formation of alteration zones rather than ore bodies.\nBased on the Cl spatial distribution, it is inferred that a considerable amount of HCl, accompanied by CO2, Hg, H2O vapor and other gases, partitioned into the gas phase during the phase separation because the relatively high temperature and originally acidic conditions of ore-forming fluid (Li et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2020). The HCl was highly unstable and formed the Cl enrichment zones by interacting with the wall rock above the ore bodies. The extremely high Cl anomalies at the surface may have been caused by the presence of seawater and high-salinity groundwater (Zhang et al., 2014). The Cl geochemical behavior in the ore-forming fluid is consistent with the salinity evolution of the ore-forming fluid of many gold deposits in the Jiaodong area (e.g., Jiaojia, Xiadian, Dayingezhuang, Sanshandao, Dongfeng and Linglong gold deposits). The salinities of fluid inclusions in each of the gold deposits remained relatively constant from the early to main ore-forming stages, but the salinities decreased in the late ore-forming stages (Fig. 13\n; Cai et al., 2011; F.F. Hu et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018a, Liu et al., 2018b; Chai et al., 2019a, b; Tian et al., 2020; Hu, H.L., et al., 2021). For example, in the Jiaojia gold deposit, the salinities of ore-forming fluids at the late stage (0.2%\u20133.8%NaCleqv) decreased dramatically compared with that of the early ore-forming stage (6.0%\u201310.0%NaCleqv) and main ore stage (6.5%\u20138.5% NaCleqv) (Fig. 9b, Hu et al., 2021). Notably, in the Sanshandao gold deposit, the salinities of the shallowest and deepest parts do not have such an evolutionary feature. The salinities of the shallowest parts are likely to be affected by groundwater. The salinities of the deepest fluid inclusions may indicate that wall-rock interaction (sulfidation), rather than phase separation, may be the primary control of metal deposition in deep and high-temperature orogenic gold systems (Fig. 9d; Wen et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2021).\nThe medium-to-high anomalies of Fe2O3, Cu, Pb, and Bi along the JJF suggest that the ore-forming fluid is originally rich in these elements, which is consistent with the mantle contribution to the ore-forming fluid which is rich in sulphophile elements (Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) and siderophile elements (Fe, Co, and Ni) (Chen et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018a, Liu et al., 2018b; Tan et al., 2018; Yang and Santosh, 2020; Groves et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020; Zhu and Sun, 2021; Li et al., 2020a; Hu et al., 2021). Yang et al. (2020b) presented evidence that the metallogenic belt in the Qujia gold deposit is rich in Cu, Pb, Zn, Bi, and Mo (Table 2\n). These metals were initially transported as chloride complexes in the ore-forming fluid. As pH increases from acidic to near-neutral conditions in a typical Cl- and S-bearing fluid, sulfide mineral solubility decreases dramatically (Kouzmanov and Pokrovski, 2012; Pokrovski et al., 2014). Both the destabilization of metal chloride complexes because of HCl loss and the increase of S2- concentration because of the pH increase caused an intensive precipitation of sulfide minerals. The precipitation of sulfide minerals scavenged the reduced S in the ore-forming fluid, resulting in the destabilization and precipitation of Au. In addition, temperature decrease of the residual liquid phase also reduced the solubility of solute (Pokrovski et al., 2014).\n\n\n4.2\nSignificance of Hg geochemical behavior in Au mineralization\nNearly 72% of the Hg anomalies are caused by geological mineralization belts and ore mining in China (Wang et al., 2021a). Mercury is a traditional pathfinder in geochemical exploration of epithermal gold deposits. Mercury usually occurs in the vapor state and migrates along faults, fractures, or other channels to form broad and intensive halos (McCarthy, 1972; Aftabi and Azzaria, 1983).\nThe Hg spatial distribution provides more convincing evidence for the presence of phase separation in Au mineralization. Medium-to-high Hg anomalies in the JJF are small in scale and mainly appear near ore bodies. This suggests that due to high temperature and limited content of reduced S, \n\n\n\nHg\n\n\n(\ng\na\ns\n)\n\n0\n\n\n is the dominant form of Hg, with minor Hg in the form of impurity of other minerals (e.g., solid solutions with Ag, Au, and Cu, isomorphous admixtures) (Chudnenko and Palyanova, 2013; Naumov and Osovetsky, 2013; Chapman et al., 2017; Fielding et al., 2019; Orsoev, 2019). Mercury can only form medium-to-high anomalies in \u201ctraps\u201d (e.g., dilational cracks or fault intersections) during or after Au mineralization. The traps are favorable spaces for the Au precipitation. Most of the Hg partitioned into the gas phase and escaped to shallow parts along the secondary faults. Fuethermore, the funnel-like vertical Hg anomalies and depletion zones above the ore bodies are ideal evidence of the presence of phase separation. The Hg depletion zones formed above the ore bodies also suggests most Hg is in the form of \n\n\n\nHg\n\n\n(\ng\na\ns\n)\n\n0\n\n\n and that the phase separation is intensive. As Hg migrated to shallow depths, part of the Hg precipitated and formed anomalies along the transportation channels due to the decreased temperature and pressure. Therefore, Hg content generally tended to increase from deep to shallow depths, forming funnel-like vertical Hg anomalies. Meanwhile, part of the Hg migrated directly to the surface and formed high anomalies in the near-surface medium (Wang et al., 2021b).\nCompared to the suggestion that medium-to-high Hg anomalies in deep depths are valid indicators in Au geochemical exploration (Wang et al., 2021b), the newly obtained borehole geochemical data show that medium-to-high Hg anomalies accompanied by no or low Au anomalies vector towards nearby concealed ore bodies. Medium-to-high Hg anomalies accompanied by medium-to-high Au anomalies can appear in traps due to decompression (no or mild phase separation) of the ore-forming fluid, which results in the formation of alterations rather than ore bodies.\n\n\n4.3\nPb geochemical behavior\nThe 3D distribution of Pb suggests the ore-forming fluid is highly rich in Pb and Pb partitioned into the gas phase forming widespread medium-to-high anomalies above the JJF. There are few studies specifically on vapor transport of Pb. Studies on fluid inclusions of ore deposits suggest Pb preferentially partition into the brine (probably as Cl complexes) (Heinrich et al., 1999; Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005). Studies on compositions of fumarolic gases of volcanos support the presence of vapor transport of Pb (Symonds et al., 1987; Taran et al., 1995, 2001; Yudovskaya et al., 2006; Chaplygin et al., 2015a, Chaplygin et al., 2015b; Mandon et al., 2019). The Pb contents in the gas condensates from Colima, Kudryavy, Merapi, are up to 0.48\u00a0\u03bcg\/g (Taran et al., 2001), 0.58\u00a0\u03bcg\/g (Taran et al., 1995), 1.50\u00a0\u03bcg\/g (Symonds et al., 1987), 5095\u00a0\u03bcg\/L (Yudovskaya et al., 2006) and 11900\u00a0\u03bcg\/kg (Chaplygin et al., 2016) respectively. Vapors containing high Pb contents emanates from basaltic magmas and andesitic volcanoes (Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005). More convincing evidence comes from the studies of fluid inclusions. The mean Pb contents in the brine, vapor, critical, and liquid-rich inclusions from the Bismark skarn deposit are 3355\u00a0\u03bcg\/g, 2465\u00a0\u03bcg\/g, 728\u00a0\u03bcg\/g, and\u00a0<\u00a0466\u00a0\u03bcg\/g respectively (Baker et al., 2004), suggesting that Pb preferably partitioned into the gas phase. The study on some vapor inclusion assemblages in the quartz veinlets form the Bingham porphyry suggested Pb preferentially fractionated into the vapor phase relative to Na (Pb\/Na\u00a0=\u00a01.38) (Landtwing et al., 2005).\n\n\n4.4\nOre genesis and geochemical exploration\nThe JJF is a typical transpressive fault, and a fault-valve model was adopted to explain the occurrence of phase separation. The fault valve model consists of the progressive buildup of fluid pressures between rupture events and rapid fluid pressure release during and immediately after faulting in fault systems that localize fluid flow (Sibson, 1990; Sibson et al., 1988; Wilkinson and Johnston, 1996; Hodkiewicz et al., 2009; Peterson and Mavrogenes, 2014). Phase separation is one of the two main precipitation mechanisms for gold deposits in the JJF (Wang et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020) and other gold deposits in the Jiaodong gold province (Yang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Chai et al., 2019a, b; Guo et al., 2020, Fan et al., 2021).Phase separation caused the liquid to become alkaline (pH increase) because of the loss of acidic vapors, including CO2, HCl, and a small amount of H2S.The loss of acidic vapors leads to the precipitation of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and argentite (Pokrovski et al., 2014). Sulfur consumption by metals in ore-forming fluids may explain a decrease in the total activity of S which destabilizes Au-S complexes (Figs. 6-8 and Fig. 11). It should be emphasized that the intensive phase separation is the dominant factor in the formation of ore bodies. The large-scale No. 3 Hg anomaly is accompanied by an Au anomaly (alteration) rather than an ore body (Fig. 12). This indicates the presence of a trap for Au mineralization (dilational crack), but the buildup of the fluid pressure was not sufficient to cause the formation of secondary faults or reactivation of the existing fault. Therefore, Au and Hg in the ore-forming fluid slowly precipitated as the temperature decreased, forming a relatively homogeneous Au alteration and high Hg anomaly. We infer that this may be a result of the accumulation of ore-forming fluids in the trap in the late stage of mineralization. Another possibility is that the ore body is distributed in the deeper parts of the JJF.\nPhase separation induces characteristic distributions of Au, S, Cl, Hg, and Pb, which are significant in Au geochemical exploration. As suggested by Wang et al. (2021b), composite anomalies of Au and Hg in soils are a potential indicator of deep concealed ore bodies. The vertical Hg anomalies indicate the presence of phase separation causing the formation of ore bodies, and Hg anomalies near the surface are also potential indicators for Au geochemical exploration. However, hydrothermal fluids unrelated to Au mineralization can also form Hg anomalies near the surface (Varekamp and Buseck, 1986; Kodosky, 1989; Li et al., 1995; Ozerova, 1996; Fitzgerald and Lamborg, 2014; Yang et al., 2015). Fortunately, both Au-bearing nanoparticles and phase separation can contribute to the formation of Au anomalies in the surface medium. Gold-bearing nanoparticles from the ore bodies can migrate to the surface because of their penetration and fast migration capabilities (Wang et al., 1997; Wang, 2003; Wang and Ye, 2011; Zhang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020b; Han et al., 2020a, Han et al., 2020b). Meanwhile, Au partitions into the gas phase during phase separation (Williams-Jones et al., 2002; Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005; Zhang et al., 2008; Zezin et al., 2011; Ciobanu et al., 2012; Pokrovski et al., 2013; Zajacz et al., 2017; Tombros and Fitros, 2019) and migrates to the surface. However, only minor amounts of Au were partitioned into the gas phase in this study. Consequently, low-to-medium Au anomalies and high Hg anomalies formed in the surface medium above the ore bodies. Gold and Hg experienced secondary enrichment under supergene weathering. More importantly, Hg is more stable than Au under supergene weathering because most Hg is in the form of insoluble inorganic substances (mainly HgS) and adsorption states in soils (Revis et al., 1989; Biester and Scholz, 1996; Gabriel and Williamson, 2004; Han et al., 2006; Jing et al., 2010). Therefore, the composite anomalies of Au and Hg can exclude Hg anomalies unrelated to Au mineralization and highlight the composite anomalies consisting of high Hg anomalies and low-to-medium Au anomalies. Theoretically, the distribution of surface anomalies is in the charge of the occurrence of secondary faults. For example, ore body 2 failed to form related anomalies in the near-surface medium above it. Furthermore, a high Hg anomaly accompanied by no or low Au anomaly in the Jiaojia main fault vectors towards a concealed ore body nearby. Such anomalies suggest that Au and Hg are strongly differentiated by phase separation, while high Hg anomalies accompanied by medium-to-high Au anomalies indicate no or mild phase separation forming alterations rather than ore bodies.\nChlorine and S are usually considered as mineralizers (Li et al., 1995). In the 1970\u00a0s and 1980\u00a0s, the use of Cl in exploration geochemistry has been extensively studied. The results of published case studies indicate that Cl forms broad dispersion patterns in rocks and soils around hydrothermal mineralization and, consequently, is a useful pathfinder (Stollery et al., 1971; Parry, 1972; Olade, 1977; Andrews et al., 1984; Fuge et al., 1986). In this study, an extremely high Cl anomaly (Cl content\u00a0greater than\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcg\/g) is a potential indicator of concealed ore bodies because the Cl enrichment zones appear in the wall rock adjacent to the ore bodies, which is consistent with the situation in the Buick Pb-Zn-Ag deposit (Panno et al., 1983) and the hydrothermal vein-type Au and Pb-Zn mineralization in central and northern Wales (Fuge et al., 1986). However, this indicator should be used with caution. In shallow depths, groundwater ingress affects the of Cl distribution in fault zones (e.g., ZK3\u2032-07) because the groundwater in the East Bank of Laizhou Bay is rich in Cl (62.84\u20132736.31\u00a0mg\/L; mean value: 354.91\u00a0mg\/L) (Zhang et al., 2014). In deep traps, fluid-wall rock interactions without intensive phase separation can also form Cl enrichment zones, but such a zone is characterized by a medium Cl content and large thickness while the Cl anomaly formed by the phase separation tends to be a narrow peak. Intensive precipitation of metal sulfides consumed the reduced S in the ore-forming fluid, resulting in the destabilization and precipitation of Au. In addition, the presence of large amounts of polymetallic sulfides also vectors towards concealed ore bodies.\nA genesis model of the ore bodies and anomalies in the study area is shown in Fig. 14\n. The genesis process can be described as follows: the ore-forming fluid migrates and accumulates in the traps and causes a buildup of the fluid pressure; the formation of new secondary faults or activation of pre-existing faults occurs when the overpressure is larger than the corresponding rock fracture pressure or lithostatic load; consequently, a sharp decrease in the fluid pressure results in an intensive phase separation. The intensive phase separation increases the pH due to the escape of acidic volatiles (e.g., CO2, HCl and a small amount of H2S), and induces a large-scale precipitation of metal sulfides, which causes the destabilization and precipitation of Au to form ore bodies. Elemental geochemical patterns were classified into two categories based on the characteristics of ore bodies. One category is the element geochemical patterns caused by ore bodies 1 and 3 which were distributed in the fault intersections. The newly formed vertical secondary faults were responsible for the phase separations. The HCl in the gas phase interacted intensively with the wall rock above the orebodies and formed Cl enrichment zones. Mercury distribution was considerably instructive and consisted of an Hg depletion zone, funnel-shaped anomaly and high Hg anomaly in the surface medium from deep to shallow depths. Meanwhile, minor Au (neutral and less polar species of Au-S\/Cl complexes and Au-bearing nanoparticles) partitioned into the gas phase and migrated to shallow depths, forming low-to-medium Au anomalies along the transportation channels (Fig. 9b) and medium-to-high Au anomalies in the surface medium. Mercury anomaly may appear below the ore body due to Hg accumulation in traps during the late or post ore-forming stage. The other category is the element geochemical patterns caused by the ore body 2 which is distributed in the dilational cracks in the JJF. The activation of pre-existing faults is likely the dominant factor for the phase separation. The chlorine enrichment zone is distributed in the updip direction of ore body 2. There was no identifiable Hg and Au anomalies in the surface medium related to ore body 2 despite the presence of a Hg anomaly above ore body 2. Notably, the later element geochemical patterns tended to be strongly disturbed by the intensive activities of the ore-forming fluid along the JJF. Meanwhile, all ore bodies are accompanied by medium-to-high anomalies of Fe2O3, Cu, and Bi which possibly are in the form of metal sulfides. In addition, there were extremely high Au and Hg anomalies near the outcrop of the JJF because the ore-forming fluid can migrate directly along the JJF to the surface.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe spatial distributions and correlations of the elements suggest that phase separation is responsible for Au mineralization in the Qujia gold deposit. During the phase separation, Hg, Cl (HCl), and Pb partitioned into the gas phase to form Cl enrichment zones, Hg depletion zones and funnel-shaped Hg anomalies, and medium-to-high Pb anomalies above the ore bodies, while Au, S, Fe2O3, Cu, and Bi mainly partitioned into the liquid phase and precipitated to form the ore bodies and anomalies.\n\n\n(2)\nPrevious opinion held that H2S escaping during phase separation leads to gold precipitation. In contrast, we determined that pH increases due to the CO2, HCl, and minor amounts of H2S from ore-forming fluids during phase separation and S consumption by abundant metals in ore-forming fluids, caused the destabilization and precipitation of Au in the Qujia gold deposit.\n\n\n(3)\nThe composite anomaly of Au and Hg in the near-surface medium is a potential indicator of deep concealed ore bodies. Meanwhile, Hg anomalies accompanied by no or weak Au anomalies, and extremely high Cl anomalies and the presence of abundant polymetallic sulfides in deep space are also potential indicators of geochemical exploration for concealed ore bodies in the Qujia and other areas of Jiaodong gold province.\n\n\n\n\n","34":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAccurate geochronological dating of mineralization events is crucial in understanding orogenic gold system and its relations with continental dynamic evolution (Yang et al., 2014; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Wyman et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2020). However, datable sulfide minerals commonly occur as intergrowth or overgrowth with multiple generations (G. Li et al., 2018), which yielded mixed Re-Os and Rb-Sr isochron ages for the orebodies (Selby and Creaser, 2004; Aleinikoff et al., 2012). Meanwhile, mica 40Ar-39Ar isotopic system (with lower closure temperature: 300\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C) can be easily reset by later tectonothermal events (Br\u00f6cker et al., 2013). Moreover, the ability to date orogenic-type deposits is often hampered by the lack of suitable minerals for dating. In southern Tibet, previous studies mainly used 40Ar-39Ar and electron spin resonance (ESR) dating of hydrothermal minerals (such as sericite, quartz, and illite) to constrain the timing of orogenic gold mineralization (Sun et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). These studies yielded various ages, leading to different interpretations on the regional metallogeny and tectonic evolution.\nThe apatite U-Pb isotopic closure temperature is 350\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C, making it a good medium-temperature geochronometer (Chew et al., 2011; Thomson et al., 2012; Chew et al., 2014; Chew and Spikings, 2015; Glorie et al., 2019). Apatite can be formed in many magmatic and hydrothermal processes, and can be used to date the timing of magmatism and hydrothermal mineralization (Chew et al., 2011; Thomson et al., 2012; Chew et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2016). Moreover, apatite is a good recorder for the ore-forming environment, as volatiles and trace-element geochemistry in apatite can provide insights into the ore fluid properties (Belousova et al., 2002; Prowatke and Klemme, 2006; Mao et al., 2016; Krneta et al., 2017; Palma et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2020). For example, magmatic apatite from mafic rocks in the North China Craton has homogeneous texture (under cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging) and rarely contains inclusions. These apatite grains yielded a Tera-Wasserburg lower intercept age consistent (within error) with the co-existing magmatic zircon and baddeleyite ages, suggesting that magmatic apatite U-Pb dating is robust and reliable (Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, apatite has also been successfully used to date hydrothermal ore deposits and extends our understanding on the genesis and tectonic settings (e.g., Chen et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; W.B. Zheng et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022). Yu et al. (2020) obtained hydrothermal apatite U-Pb age of 235.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0Ma and bracketed that the Ludousou gold mineralization event occurred at ca. 236\u00a0Ma postdating the magmatism. This work extends the orogenic gold mineralization event in the West Qinling related to the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean tracing back to ca. 236\u00a0Ma. Apart from the above, apatite U-Pb dating is a powerful tool for determining buried rocks at depth and constraining the bottom of gold mineralization in the giant Jiaodong gold province (Yu et al., 2022).\nIn southern Tibet, the Cenozoic orogenic Au belt of the Indus-Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone (IYZSZ) extends for 1300\u00a0km from the Zhongba block to Langjiexue Group, hosting the Mayum, Nianzha, Bangbu, Mazhala, Juqu, and Zhemulang deposits. These gold deposits were suggested to have formed during the India-Asia collision at ca. 59\u201344\u00a0Ma (Sun et al., 2016, Zhao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). The Nianzha gold deposit is the latest discovered deposit in the belt and is hosted in the contact fracture zone between ultramafic rocks and diorite in the Renbu tectonic m\u00e9lange. The deposit contains proven reserve of 25 metric tonnes (t) Au @ 3.08\u00a0g\/t (Zhang et al., 2019). Due to the lack of age constraint on the dioritic wall rocks and gold orebodies, the ore genesis at Nianzha is still disputed to be orogenic-type or intrusion-related.\nBased on the textural relationship, magmatic Type I and hydrothermal Type II apatite were identified from the Nianzha gold deposit. In situ LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircon and apatite was carried out to constrain the age and genesis of the Nianzha gold mineralization.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and deposit geology\nThe Himalayan-Tibetan orogen is composed of (from south to north) the Himalayas, Lhasa, Qiangtang, and Songpan-Ganze terranes, which are separated by the Indus-Yarlung Zangbo, Bangong-Nujiang, and Jinshajiang suture zones, respectively (Fig. 1\nA, B; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Hou and Wang, 2008; Zhu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018). Three tectonic units in the Himalayan metallogenic belt can be identified from north to south: the Lhasa terrane, the IYZSZ, and the Himalayan terrane (Fig. 2\nA). The study area is located in the Renbu ophiolitic m\u00e9lange belt of southern Tibet (Fig. 2B). The Lhasa terrane is a complex microcontinental fragment (Zhu et al., 2011). The Nianzha gold deposit is located on the southern margin of the terrane, in which the Cretaceous-early Paleocene calc-alkaline Gangdese batholith is widely exposed (Fig. 1B; Fang et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2016; Searle et al., 1987; Wang et al., 2012, 2017; Wei et al., 2020; Yin and Harrison, 2000). The IYZSZ is one of the most important tectonic boundaries in southern Tibet and extends E\u2013W for over 2000\u00a0km (Fig. 1B). Bounded by the Xigaze forearc basin sequence and the Gangdese batholith to the north and the Triassic flysch to the south (Fig. 2A; Zhu et al., 2013; C. Zhang et al., 2017; Metcalf and Kapp, 2017; Zheng et al., 2017; Y. Li et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019), the IYZSZ can be divided into four structural units (from north to south): namely the Xigaze forearc basin, the Yarlung-Zangbo ophiolite, and the subduction tectonic complex (m\u00e9lange) (Fig. 2A; Ding et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2012; An et al., 2014). The Himalayan terrane is further divided into the Tethys, Higher Himalaya, and Lesser Himalaya terranes by the Southern Tibet Detachment System Fault, the Main Central Thrust, and the Main Boundary Thrust, respectively (Figs. 1B and 2A) (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Liu et al., 2019; W.B. Zheng et al., 2021).\nThe Upper Triassic sequence is the most widely exposed unit in the study area, mainly consisting of the Langjiexue Group and Nieru Unit. Bounded by the Great Counter Thrust to the north and the Lazi\u2013Qiongduojiang thrust to the south, the Langjiexue Group is thrust northwards over the IYZSZ, which is formed in association with the Neo-Tethys subduction (Fig. 2A). The Langjiexue Group is composed of lithic feldspathic quartz sandstone and tectonic blocks of ophiolite, volcanic breccia, and basalt (Fang et al., 2018; W.B. Zheng et al., 2021). The group is cut by nearly E\u2013W trending faults with the Nieru Unit and Jurassic-Cretaceous strata in the footwall (Fig. 2A).\nThe Renbu tectonic m\u00e9lange belt extends across the Nianzha mining area, and is crosscut by low-angle normal faults and later strike-slip faults. Most of the ophiolite in this belt was dismembered, except for a few areas (e.g., Xigaze) that remain relatively intact (Zhang et al., 2019). The belt consists mainly of weakly-deformed slate and metasandstone (Li et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2019).\nMany orogenic Au\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Sb and Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn(-Ag) deposits were discovered in the IYZSZ throughout the North Himalaya (Fig. 2A). Inside the North Himalaya, a series of metamorphic core complexes are nearly E-W-trending distributed and controlled several domes, namely (from west to east) the Kangma, Ranba, and Yelaxiangbo (Fig. 2A), These domes are intruded by the Himalayan leucogranite in the central part, with secondary faults and fissures\/joints controlling the local mineralization (Liu et al., 2019; Y.L. Zheng et al., 2021). The Nianzha Au deposit is located within the ophiolitic m\u00e9lange. The exposed strata at Nianzha consist mainly of the Upper Triassic Songre Formation fine-sand to silty slates intercalated with sericite\/carbonaceous slates. Lenses of ultramafic rocks are mainly E-W-trending distributed on the southern side of the diorite in the mine. A few Eocene granite dikes crosscut the ore-hosting diorite (Fig. 2B).\nThe orebodies mainly occur in the contact fracture zone between ophiolite and diorites in the Renbu tectonic m\u00e9lange (Fig. 2B). The Nianzha gold deposit comprises three orebodies (I, II, and III), among them orebodies I and II are more important. The mineralization was developed in fracture zones (>500\u00a0m long) (Fig. 3\nA, B). The Nianzha gold deposit is the second-largest gold deposit in southern Tibet, and detailed geological descriptions of this deposit have been given by previous studies (X. Zhang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). To summarize, the NW-trending (SW-dipping) fault system is the main ore-bearing fault at Nianzha. The transpressive movement has thrusted the Yarlung Zangbo ophiolitic m\u00e9lange over the diorite. The EW-trending (south-dipping), NE-trending (SE-dipping), and near-NS-trending (near-vertical) faults are all post-mineralization, and have dislocated the orebody (Fig. 2B, Fig. 4\nA; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).\nGold mineralization is suggested to be associated with silicic and carbonate alterations (Y.L. Zheng et al., 2021). Other alteration styles at Nianzha include sericite, serpentine, and chlorite. Hydrothermal alteration is dominated by ore-proximal quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate\u00a0+\u00a0sulfide assemblage and ore-distal serpentine\u00a0+\u00a0chlorite\u00a0+\u00a0epidote assemblage. The main gold-bearing minerals are pyrite, limonite, and quartz with minor hematite, magnetite, and carbonate minerals. According to mineral assemblages and crosscutting relationship, the alteration\/mineralization at Nianzha can be divided into the hypogene hydrothermal and supergene phase, with the former containing three stages: (I: pre-ore) coarse-grained quartz-feldspar\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sulfide (mainly pyrite) veining; (II: main ore) fine-grained smoky quartz\u2013sulfide veining with medium-grained ankerite and muscovite in vein. Abundant euhedral-subhedral type II apatite grains associated with sulfides and hematite, whilst native gold (10\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm diameter) and electrum are found in fractures or within\/along the boundaries of pyrite, limonite, and quartz (Fig. 5\nE-I); (III: post-ore) gold-barren milky quartz vein and quartz\u2013calcite veining crosscut stages I and II mineral assemblages (Fig. 4B) Supergene mineralization is mainly distributed between the diorite and the Quaternary sediments and peridotite (Fig. 4C-E). The reddish limonite mineralization fills joints\/fissures as fine veins and clumps. Supergene ores are commonly of high grade (2\u20136\u00a0g\/t). X. Zhang et al. (2017) reported that fluid inclusions from ore-related quartz belong to a H2O-NaCl-organic gas system, and homogenized at 203\u2013347\u00a0\u00b0C (peak at 240\u2013260\u00a0\u00b0C) with salinity of 4.64\u20136.00\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. Study of C\u2013H-O isotopes showed that gold mineralization was formed mainly from the mixing of metamorphic water and organic water from sediments with minor meteoric input. The near-zero \u03b434S value (-2.9 to 1.9%) indicates that the ore sulfur at Nianzha was mainly magmatic derived. Meanwhile, lead isotopes show that the metals were mainly mantle-sourced with minor crustal input. Such isotopic characteristics of the ore-forming fluids and materials suggesting an orogenic Au affinity for Nianzha (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 1998).\n\n\n3\nSamples and analytical methods\n\n3.1\nSample descriptions\nTwo diorite samples (NZ03 and NZ08) were collected from northern Nianzha for zircon U-Pb dating (Fig. 4B, C). The rocks are medium-grained, equigranular, and consist of plagioclase (50\u201365\u00a0vol%), K-feldspar (10\u201325\u00a0vol%), amphibole (15\u201320\u00a0vol%), biotite (5\u201310\u00a0vol%), and quartz (5\u00a0vol%).\nFour diorite and syenite samples (NZ004ZK, NZ006ZK, NZ008ZK, and NZ018ZK) were collected from drill holes on the Prospecting Lines 12th and 13th (Fig. 3A, B). Samples NZ004ZK, NZ006ZK, and NZ008ZK were extracted from the fracture zone (Fig. 3B), each weighing 1\u20133\u00a0kg for the subsequent U-Pb zircon and apatite analyses (Fig. 5A, B). They consist of K-feldspar (30\u00a0vol%), plagioclase (20\u201330\u00a0vol%), albite (20\u00a0vol%), and hornblende (20\u00a0vol%), with accessory apatite, titanite, rutile, and zircon (Fig. 5 A, C-D). Sample NZ018ZK is silicified and mineralized quartz diorite (Fig. 5B), with fine-grained smoky quartz\u2013sulfide veins occur as fracture infill (Fig. 5B). This sample is also sericite-actinolite-chlorite altered (Fig. 5E-G).\n\n\n3.2\nAnalytical methods\n\n3.2.1\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nAfter conventional heavy liquid and magnetic separation, zircons were handpicked under a binocular microscope, mounted onto an epoxy resin disc, polished, and carbon-coated. Carbon-coated polished sections were prepared to observe their micro-textures and to characterize the mineral inclusions in apatite using the Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) detector. Zircon CL images were obtained at the Guangzhou Tuoyan Analytical Technology Co. Ltd. (China), using a TESCAN MIRA 3 Analytical Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). The working condition includes 10\u201315\u00a0kV electric field. Thin-section SEM observations were performed with a TESCAN VEGA 3 SEM equipped with secondary electron (SE), backscattered electron (BSE), CL, and EDS detectors at the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Marine Resources and Coastal Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). Zircon and apatite crystals were checked carefully under the optical microscope and SEM to identify any internal structural features, fluid inclusions, and cracks.\n\n\n3.2.2\nElectron probe microanalysis (EPMA)\nMajor and minor element concentrations in the apatite samples (NZ004, NZ006, NZ008, and NZ018) were measured with a JEOL JXA 8230 EMPA at the Wuhan Sample Solution Analytical Technology Co. Ltd. (China), and a JEOL JXA-8530F Plus EPMA at the Instrumental Analysis and Research Center (SYSU). In both cases, ZAF correction routines were employed, and both natural and synthetic standards were used.\nOperating conditions include 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage, 20 nA beam current, and 5\u00a0\u03bcm spot size. Each analysis consists of a counting time of 10\u00a0s for F, Cl, K, and Na; 20\u00a0s for Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, P; 80\u00a0s for Ti and Mn; and 120\u00a0s for S. The standards of F (BaF2), Cl (tugtupite), Na (albite), Ca (apatite), P (apatite), Si (chrome-diopside), Mn (rhodonite), Fe (magnetite), Mg (olivine), and S (pyrite) were used.\n\n\n3.2.3\nLA-ICP-MS apatite and zircon U\u2013Pb dating and trace element analysis\nThe analyses were conducted at the Key Laboratory of Marine Resources and Coastal Engineering, SYSU. Laser sampling was performed using a GeoLasPro ArF excimer laser ablation system, coupled with an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS. All analyses were conducted with a 32\u00a0\u03bcm beam diameter, 5\u00a0Hz repetition rate, and 5\u00a0J\/cm2 energy density. The zircon 91500 was used as an external standard (published TIMS ages of 206Pb\/238U\u00a0=\u00a01062.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma and 207Pb\/206Pb\u00a0=\u00a01065.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma; Jackson et al., 2004). The apatite analyses were conducted with a beam diameter of 60 or 44\u00a0\u03bcm, with 5\u00a0J\/cm2 energy density and 5\u00a0Hz repetition rate. The apatite trace element compositions were calibrated against the NIST 610 standard, and the Ca content determined by EPMA was used as the internal standard. Each analysis consists of an 18\u00a0s background measurement (laser-off) followed by a 45\u00a0s sample data acquisition (laser-on). Data reduction was performed with the software Iolite version 4.3 (Paton et al., 2011).\nApatite U-Pb dating was performed using an Analytikjena M90 quadrupole ICPMS coupled with a 193\u00a0nm NWR193 ArF excimer laser at the Yanduzhongshi Geological Analysis Laboratories Ltd. The downhole fractionation, instrument drift, and mass bias correction factors for Pb\/U ratios on apatite were calculated using two analyses on the primary standard MAD2 (Cochrane et al., 2014) and secondary standard apatites of McClure Mt (Schoene and Bowring, 2006), Otter Lake (Barfod et al., 2005; Chew et al., 2011) and Durango (McDowell et al., 2005). The standards were analyzed at the beginning of the session and every ten unknown apatites, using the same spot size and conditions as the sample analyses. Each analysis on the apatite began with a 20\u00a0s blank gas measurement, followed by 40\u00a0s laser-on sample analysis. Apatite was sampled on 40-\u03bcm spot using 8\u00a0Hz laser and 4\u00a0J\/cm2 energy density. A flow of He carrier gas (0.55\u00a0L\/min) carried ablated particles to be mixed with Ar makeup gas before entering the plasma torch. Isotopes measured were 31P, 44Ca, 140Ce, 202Hg, 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb, 232Th, and 238U, with each element being measured every 0.18\u00a0s with longer counting time on the Pb isotopes. The data reduction was based on the method described by Meffre et al. (2008), with an additional modification to correct the minor common Pb in the primary standard, using the 207Pb correction of Chew et al. (2014). The Isoplot R software (Vermeesch, 2018) was used to construct the Tera-Wasserburg plot and weighted mean calculation.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nCharacteristics of apatite\nTwo types of apatite (type I and II) show distinct characteristics (Figs. 5, 6\n; Table 1\n), and their major and trace element contents are listed in Supplementary Tables A and B and illustrated in Figs. 10-12.\n\n4.1.1\nType I apatite\nType I apatite grains are hosted in diorite and syenite rocks and have the following characteristics: (1) They are authigenic intergrown with other magmatic minerals (e.g., Hornblende, plagioclase (or orthoclase), and biotite) (Figs. 5C-D and 6A-D); (2) They vary from euhedral to subhedral, up to 60\u00a0\u03bcm in width; (3) They are commonly transparent and homogenous in CL images, and typically display yellow-green luminescence (Fig. 6B, D); (4) The total rare earth element contents (\u03a3REE\u00a0=\u00a0752.0\u20133608.1\u00a0ppm) do not vary significantly, and the LREE\/HREE fractionation (11.00\u201330.36) is significant. The REE patterns are similar to their host rocks (Fig. 10).\n\n\n4.1.2\nType II apatite\nType II apatite grains are discovered in mineralized quartz diorite and have the following characteristics: (1) They are euhedral-subhedral and coarser (max size: 400\u00a0\u03bcm) than Type I apatite, and occur in quartz veins or coexist with hydrothermal pyrite, sericite, hematite and magnetite (Fig. 6E-L); (2) They appear heterogeneous in CL images with a yellow luminescence; (3) Their \u03a3REE varies greatly (1187.2\u20136827.5\u00a0ppm) and they show higher chondrite-normalized LREE enrichment (LaN\/SmN\u00a0=\u00a01.98\u20134.70) and more obvious negative Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu* = 0.29\u20130.51) than type I apatite (LaN\/SmN\u00a0=\u00a00.82\u20133.89; Eu\/Eu* = 0.5\u20131.04) (Supplementary Table B; Fig. 10); (4) They have much higher Cl content (0.48\u20131.03 %) and Cl\/F ratio (0.17\u20130.93) than Type I apatite (Cl\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u20130.37%; Cl\/F\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u20130.17) (Fig. 11), and the SiO2 and MnO contents of the former are also higher; (5) they have 21.2\u2013192.2\u00a0ppm U, 8.3\u2013275.1\u00a0ppm Th, and Th\/U\u00a0=\u00a00.39\u20131.48. Their U and Th contents correlate positively with \u03a3REE, \u03a3LREE, and \u03a3HREE contents (Supplementary Table B); (6) they have higher As (16.6\u2013546.4\u00a0ppm) and Mn (578.5\u20131217.8\u00a0ppm) contents, but lower Sr (381.1\u2013484.3\u00a0ppm) content than Type I apatite (Fig. 11).\n\n\n\n4.2\nZircon U-Pb geochronology\nAll of the zircons have magmatic texture (Fig. 7\n) and high Th\/U ratios (NZ03: 0.25\u20131.53; NZ08: 0.32\u20130.72; NZ004ZK: 0.26\u20130.79; NZ018ZK: 0.41\u20130.97), indicating amagmaticorigin. Their U-Pb ages are interpreted to be the diorite crystallization ages. Eighteen and 27 zircons were dated on the diorite NZ03 and NZ08, respectively, which yielded concordant ages of 84.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a04.75, n\u00a0=\u00a018; Fig. 8\nA) and 86.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.05, n\u00a0=\u00a027; Fig. 8B). For the diorite sample NZ004ZK and mineralized quartz diorite sample NZ018ZK, fifty zircons of the former yielded concordant age of 84.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.76, n\u00a0=\u00a050; Fig. 8C), whilst 40 zircons of the latter yielded a concordant age of 86.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.5, n\u00a0=\u00a040; Fig. 8D) (Table 2\n).\n\n\n4.3\nApatite U-Pb geochronology\nEighty-six analyses are analyzed on Type I apatite from the diorite sample NZ004ZK, yielding lower intercept age of 80.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.56\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.38, n\u00a0=\u00a086), and the y-intercept of initial 207Pb\/206Pb at 0.8604\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0038 (Fig. 9\n\n\n\nB). Seventy-two analyses were analyzed on Type I apatite from the syenite sample NZ008ZK. The lower intercept age is 79.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.91, n\u00a0=\u00a072), and the y-intercept of initial 207Pb\/206Pb is 0.8491\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0027 (Fig. 9F). An average of present-day crustal composition (207Pb\/206Pb\u00a0=\u00a00.8408) (Stacey and Kramers, 1975) and the 207Pb-based method were used for the common Pb correction. All the analyses yielded a weighted average 206Pb\/238U age of 79.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.07) (Fig. 9E), consistent (within error) with the lower-intercept age with most Th\/U\u00a0=\u00a00.54\u201330.37 (Table 3\n).\nSixty-four analyses were carried out on type II apatite from the mineralized quartz diorite sample NZ018ZK, yielding a lower intercept age of 44.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.2, n\u00a0=\u00a064) and the y-intercept of initial 207Pb\/206Pb of 0.848\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016 (Fig. 9D). All analyses yielded a weighted average 206Pb\/238U age of 44.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.07), consistent with the lower-intercept age with most Th\/U\u00a0=\u00a00.31\u20133.28 (Fig. 9C; Table 4\n).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nClassification of apatites\nApatite in Nianzha can be divided into two types based on their lithology, mineral assemblage, geochronology, and composition. Type I apatite grains in barren diorite and syenite occur as inclusions or interstitial among magmatic minerals, suggesting coeval precipitation and a magmatic origin. The age of type I apatite (80\u201382\u00a0Ma) is also consistent with that of magmatic zircon (84\u201386\u00a0Ma) if considering the errors, further confirming that the type I apatite was originally primary magmatic. Furthermore, their high F (1.35\u20133.25%) and SO3 (0\u20130.18%) but low MnO (0\u20130.08%), resembling typical magmatic apatite and may reflect the parental magma compositions (Chen and Zhang, 2018). All these above demonstrate the magmatic origin of type I apatite, which crystallized during the host rock formation (Table 3).\nPetrographic observations in type II apatite from mineralized diorite suggest the apatite particles enclosed in sericite, hematite, and quartz, constituting a flat interface with them (Figs. 5E, G and 6I, L), thus indicating coeval precipitation in the hydrothermal stage II. More important, pyrite and other sulfide are distributed near or in these apatite grains (Figs. 5F and 6K), which indicates that type II apatite forms at nearly the same time as the sulfide crystallization. All the above characteristics suggest that type II apatite is of hydrothermal origin. Besides, its relatively higher LREE enrichment than magmatic apatite (type I) is commonly interpreted to have formed from metamorphic-derived crustal fluids under high water\/rock ratios (Munz et al., 1994, Harlov, 2015, Glorie et al., 2019) (Figs. 10D and 11).\n\n\n5.2\nTiming of plutonism and mineralization at Nianzha\nAn important premise of dating ore deposits is that the mineral used for dating should be genetically associated with the mineralization. The features of the hydrothermal apatite described above indicate that it was coeval with Au-bearing pyrite and its U-Pb age is considered a reliable dating method of gold mineralization in Nianzha. The hydrothermal apatite U-Pb age (44.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.45\u00a0Ma) of the mineralized diorite is consistent with muscovite Ar-Ar plateau age from Nianzha (43.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50\u00a0Ma; Zhang et al., 2018). The results indicate that the Nianzha gold mineralization occurred in the late stage of the India-Asia collision and that the apatite U-Pb chronometer is robust for dating orogenic gold mineralization. More importantly, mica has a lower closure temperature than apatite, and Ar-Ar dating is more time-consuming than apatite U-Pb dating. Therefore, the apatite U-Pb dating system just makes up the limitation of relying exclusively on mica Ar-Ar to determine mineralization age in this area, which provides an essential step toward increasing our understanding of hydrothermal Au deposit (Table 4).\nThe orebody is located in fracture zone, implying that fault activities may have controlled the mineralization. The time gap between magmatism and mineralization is significant, thus any genetic relation between the two is unlikely. The ore-forming fluids, therefore, were unlikely derived from the intrusions but probably from metamorphic fluids generated by peak metamorphic dehydration (from lower-greenschist to upper-amphibolite facies) (Fig. 12). Apatite U-Pb dating is a newly-identified tool to constrain the absolute timing of gold mineralization in the IYZSZ tectonic m\u00e9lange.\n\n\n5.3\nImplications for mineralization at Nianzha\nHydrothermal fluid compositions can be inferred from the hydrothermal minerals. Halogens (especially F and Cl) play an essential role in magmatic and hydrothermal systems and can transport metals and precipitate them (Harlov, 2015). Chlorine, in particular, is one of the main ligands associated with metal transport in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. Up to now, there are only a few studies on the halogen partition coefficient between apatite and water during hydrothermal alteration (Brenan, 1993; Kusebauch et al., 2015). Unaltered magmatic apatite can preserve the physicochemical information of the parental magma, whilst severely-altered apatite can provide insights into the chemical exchange intensity during the alteration (Harlov and F\u00f6rster, 2003; Harlov, 2015; Li and Zhou, 2015; Bouzari et al., 2016). Trace element compositions of apatite depend on several factors, including the hydrothermal fluid composition, host rock composition, temperature, pressure, pH, and Eh, as well as the partition coefficients between fluid, apatite, and co-precipitating minerals. Type I magmatic apatite is unaltered and thus has recorded the primary Cl content of the melt. Type II hydrothermal apatite has a significantly higher Cl content, suggesting that the ore-forming fluids are Cl-rich (Fig. 11). Murrell et al. (1984) suggested a positive correlation between REE and Cl contents. The correlation coefficient between F and Cl (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.43) in hydrothermal apatite indicates that Cl in hydrothermal fluid enters the apatite by replacing F during the apatite crystallization.\nUnlike the hydrothermal apatite in some deposits, where a large number of monazite inclusions in the apatite grains (Harlov, 2015; Zhang et al., 2020) and apatite show significant enrichment of MREEs and depletions of LREEs and HREEs (Chen et al., 2019). Monazite only occurs locally with quartz in Nianzha hydrothermal apatite samples. Therefore, REE patterns of Nianzha hydrothermal apatite lack depletions of LREEs and HREEs. The lack of monazite inclusions in the Nianzha hydrothermal apatite could be related to a lower initial Y\u00a0+\u00a0REEs concentration (0.1\u20130.5\u00a0wt%) of the primary apatite, or likely the ore-fluid composition (e.g., NaCl-\/CaCl2-bearing fluid) which may inhibit elements substitution, REE remobilization and monazite nucleation in apatite (Harlov et al., 2002; Harlov and F\u00f6rster, 2003; Harlov et al., 2005). The ore-fluid composition feature is consistent with the relatively high Cl content of our hydrothermal apatite samples, indicating that apatite is formed in Cl-bearing fluid preventing monazite formation. Studies have demonstrated that REEs are readily concentrated by hydrothermal processes, but where LREEs are more readily mobilized by metasomatic fluids than HREEs (Reed et al., 2000). The type I apatite REE distribution patterns share many similarities with their host rock, whereas type II apatite differs from its host rock showing higher REE content than type I apatite with pronounced negative Eu and no Y anomalies (Fig. 10). Moreover, Si can promote the entry of REEs into apatite (Si4+ + REE3+ = P5+ + Ca2+) (Anenburg et al., 2020). The type II apatite grains are associated with quartz indicating silicification of mineralization may favor this process.\nPrevious works have summarized the orogenic gold ore precipitation mechanism (Groves et al., 1998; Mikucki, 1998; Groves et al., 2003; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). When the hydrothermal fluids ascend and enter secondary or tertiary fractures (fault-valve action), boiling-related cooling and decompression would occur. When the fluids enter the precipitation site, the fluid temperature would drop, phase separation would occur by pressure drop. The temperature\u2013pressure drop is also accompanied by fluid-rock interaction and fluid mixing. These processes would destabilize the Au(HS)2\n- complex in the fluid and trigger gold precipitation (Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). At Nianzha, the alteration of hornblende to chlorite and plagioclase to sericite would liberate elements (e.g., Fe3+, Na+, and Ca2+) from the minerals to the fluid (Fig. 12). The strong silicification in the orebodies indicates that the fluid has gradually become more acidic, which also destabilizes gold-bearing complexes and promotes gold precipitation (Fig. 12).\n\n\n5.4\nPotential application of apatite U\u2013Pb dating to Au deposits in the IYZSZ\nApatite has been reported in other types of ore deposits in theQinghai\u2013TibetPlateau, such as the Xiongcun, Lakang'e, Zhunuo, Jiru, and Dabuporphyry copper deposits (Xie et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2021; Wan and Sun, 2021). However, these ore deposits are still lacking systematic investigations of apatite U-Pb dating. The orogenic gold deposits in IYZSZ generally occur in brittle-ductile shear zones in greenschist-facies metamorphic sedimentary rocks (Y.L. Zheng et al., 2021), which are related to regional orogeny (Sun et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). It is worth mentioning that other apatite samples available for dating have also been discovered in some orogenic deposits in the IYZSZ and the Himalayan terrane (our unpublished data). Hence we infer that apatite might be widespread in this area (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, if the samples with relatively higher U content and lower f206\n compared to Nianzha apatite samples (U: 1\u2013192\u00a0ppm; f206\n\u00a0>\u00a00.5), there is no doubt dating non-traditional minerals, such as apatite, can be used to constrain the formation ages of other hydrothermal deposits successfully.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nMagmatic and hydrothermal apatites from the Nianzha gold deposit were dated to determine the timing of magmatic activity and gold mineralization, respectively. U-Pb magmatic zircon and type I magmatic apatite indicate that the ore-hosting diorite\/syenite at Nianzha was emplaced in the Late Cretaceous. Meanwhile, U-Pb dating of type II hydrothermal apatite from the mineralized quartz diorite revealed an Eocene gold mineralization event (ca. 44\u00a0Ma), coeval with the India-Asia collision and represents a typical orogenic gold deposit in the region. Our study highlights that the hydrothermal apatite U-Pb chronometer is effective in constraining the age of orogenic-type gold mineralization.\n\n","35":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nA number of porphyry and epithermal Cu-Au deposits have been recognized in the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc (UDMA) of Iran (Afzal et al., 2010; Dargahi et al., 2010; Boomeri et al., 2012; Richards et al., 2012; Ayati et al., 2013; Aghazadeh et al., 2015). The Narbaghi ore district is located 26\u00a0km northeast of the city of Saveh within the central part of the UDMA (Fig. 1\n). In the Saveh area, vein-type epithermal base-metal (especially copper) mineralization has been reported, as best represented by the Kuh-Pang (Rajabpour et al., 2018); Dashte-Loein (Gohari, 2008); Gheshlagh-Mil (Lajoei-Kalaki et al., 2018); Rangraz (Dolatshahi et al., 2019); and Sarighash (Ahoran et al., 2009) deposits.\nThe Narbaghi ore district hosts the largest Cu deposit in the Saveh area and consists of two areas quite different in geological and mineralization features. The North Narbaghi vein-type mineralization, which is the subject of this paper, is located in the north of the Narbaghi village. In contrast, the East Narbaghi is characterized by stratabound Cu mineralization hosted in Eocene volcano-sedimentary rocks that have ore textures similar to those of the Manto-type copper deposits. The geology, geochemistry, and genesis of the East Narbaghi deposit have been studied by Fazli et al. (2013, 2021).\nHistorical mining activities can be found as tunnels and wells in the East Narbaghi deposit, whereas new exploration in the North Narbaghi deposit has only been carried out by the Zagros Mess Sazan (ZMS) since 2011. Exploration drilling (19 holes, totaling 2980\u00a0m) and trenching (10 trenches totaling 175\u00a0m) led to the identification of the North Narbaghi deposit in 2011. The ZMS estimated a combined reserve of 0.65 million tons of Cu-Ag ore at 0.68% Cu and 46\u00a0g\/t Ag on average for the area. The study area is currently in the mining and exploitation stage, but further exploration activities are in progress.\nThe North Narbaghi mineralization was first classified as a porphyry copper deposit by the ZMS. The North Narbaghi consists of NW-trending Cu-Ag-rich veins, breccias, and stockworks that have some similarities in main characteristics, with intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits investigated by Einaudi et al. (2003). Based on previous stable isotopes (C, O, and S) and fluid inclusion data (Fazli, 2015; Fazli and Ghaderi, 2019), the ore-forming fluids responsible for the intermediate-sulfidation epithermal mineralization are inferred to have exsolved from crystallizing subvolcanic intrusive magma.\nIn this contribution, we integrate geology, alteration assemblages, ore paragenesis, fluid inclusion microthermometry, as well as sulfur, carbon, and oxygen isotope geochemistry to provide insights into the origin of the North Narbaghi Cu-Ag deposit. The results, when combined with existing data, are also used to develop a model for the North Narbaghi deposit.\n\n\n2\nGeodynamic setting and regional geology\nMost of the economic mineral potential in Iran formed in response to complex and contractional deformation events concerning subduction and eventual closure of the Neo-Tethyan ocean in the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic (Richards and Sholeh, 2016). The UDMA extends parallel to the Zagros structural zone for more than 1700\u00a0km (Arvin et al., 2007) that lies between Central Iran and Sanandaj\u2013Sirjan zones formed above a subducting slab of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust under the Central Iran micro-continent followed by the collision of the Eurasian and Arabian plates. The wide activity of Eocene to Quaternary magmatic (intrusive and volcanic) rocks has been reported from UDMA (Alavi, 1994; Regard et al., 2004). The UDMA can be described as an Andean volcanic arc (Alavi, 1980; Berberian et al., 1982). The regional tectonic reconstruction for the UDMA of Iran in late Mesozoic-Tertiary indicates that the arc magmas are responsible for the epithermal mineralization (Alavi, 1994; Richards and Sholeh, 2016), such as the North Narbaghi deposit. Eocene volcanic rocks in the UDMA, include mainly andesite, basalt, and dacite that were erupted as pyroclastic flows, lava flows, and ignimbrites, whereas Oligo-Miocene magmatic rocks included diorite to granite intrusive bodies, intermediate-felsic volcanic eruptions, and pyroclastic rocks (Hassanzadeh, 1993). Magmatism during Eocene and Miocene is specified by calc-alkaline subduction-related volcanic arc rocks (Berberian and King, 1981; Richards and Sholeh, 2016), whereas younger volcanism is represented by more alkaline rocks (Jamali et al., 2009). This transition is interpreted to reflect a progression from subduction, to collisional, and then post-collisional processes (Richards and Sholeh, 2016). More epithermal deposits formed along the UDMA, broadly associated with arc and collisional magmatism, but have in part been lost due to uplift and erosion since Mid-Miocene (McInnes et al., 2003).\nThe study area, as the central part of UDMA, is mostly composed of lava followed by plutonic rocks; as shown in Fig. 2\n. Rocks in the North Narbaghi deposit can be divided into two groups; a) Eocene pyroclastic and volcanic sequence and b) post-Eocene subvolcanic intrusions.\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\nThe Eocene volcano-sedimentary rocks and locally subvolcanic intrusive bodies (monzodiorite and diorite) host epithermal mineralization in the North Narbaghi area. The oldest rock units in the area include Middle to Late Eocene volcano-sedimentary rocks, which are intruded by post-Eocene (Oligo-Miocene) subvolcanic intrusive bodies (Fig. 2).\nThe volcanic rocks in the North Narbaghi are sub-alkaline, based on the alkaline \u2013 sub-alkaline distinction (Irvine and Baragar, 1971) and the samples are calc-alkaline in terms of the alkali-iron-magnesium (AFM) ternary plot (Fazli, 2015; Fazli and Ghaderi, 2019). The volcanic samples from the North Narbaghi plot in the volcanic arc field on the geotectonic discrimination diagrams (Pearce et al., 1984), and indicate a subduction-related origin (Fazli et al., 2013) for volcanism in the North Narbaghi. In general, epithermal mineralization associated with calc-alkaline \u2013 tholeiitic back-arc continental magmatism as a result of subduction follows arc magmatism (John, 2001; Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003; Simmons et al., 2005).\nThe post-Eocene magmatism in the northeast of Saveh has been controlled by major WNW-ESE-trending faults, such as Takht-e-Chaman, Rangezard, and Abbas Abad and several associated small NW-SE-trending faults; all of which are related to the Alpine orogeny (Nogol Sadat and Houshmandzadeh, 1984; Amidi et al., 2006). In the North Narbaghi deposit scale, most faults trend NW-SE, and these faults are one of the main controlling features of mineralization such that all of the main high-grade veins occur along with these structures.\n\n\n4\nDistribution of rock types and petrographic studies\nDetailed petrographic studies on the microscopic sections from the North Narbaghi deposit were discussed in detail by Fazli and Ghaderi (2019), so here we just provide a summary that can be divided into two categories:\n\nEocene pyroclastic rocks and lava flows: Light yellow crystal lithic tuffs are more abundant in the southern part of the area. This unit contains both crystals and clasts, mostly plagioclase, quartz (added with alteration), Fe-oxide, calcite, and ubiquitous flattened fragments with interbedded andesite. The andesite unit is exposed predominately in the northern part of the area (Fig. 3\nA, B), with the andesitic lava forming the main volcanic sequence with porphyritic textures; this unit is marked by dark- and light-blue porphyritic andesite that is composed mostly of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and rarer hornblende phenocrysts.\n\nOligo-Miocene subvolcanic intrusive bodies: The volcanic rocks were intruded by Oligo-Miocene subvolcanic intrusive bodies ranging from calc-alkaline monzodiorite, diorite, to mega-diorite (Fig. 3A).\n1) The monzodiorite units are light yellow and have extensions in the central area (Fig. 3C). These units display porphyry textures; most of the minerals being plagioclase, orthoclase with a variable amount of accessory minerals, such as pyroxene, biotite, amphibole, and quartz (Fazli and Ghaderi, 2019).\n2) The diorite subvolcanic intrusive bodies were intruded into the Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic units; this unit is khaki and has a porphyritic texture. It is usually composed of plagioclase phenocrysts that exhibit polysynthetic twinning with lesser orthoclaseand minor biotite, with minimal quartz. Hornblende and clinopyroxene are minor (Fazli and Ghaderi, 2019).\n3) The mega-diorite unit in the southeast of the Narbaghi area is dark green to black. The mega-diorite unit is younger than the monzodiorite and diorite units (Fig. 3D). This rock has mega-grained phenocrysts with porphyritic texture, with the major mineral being plagioclase phenocrysts ranging in size from less than 8\u00a0mm to several cm (Fig. 3E); minor minerals consisting of Ca pyroxene and Ca-Na amphibole.\nDacite dyke: In the North Narbaghi deposit, the dacite dyke, with a thickness from 4 to 21\u00a0cm, cuts the Eocene pyroclastic rocks and Oligo-Miocene subvolcanic intrusive bodies and is traced only in the boreholes (Fig. 3F). Dacitic dykes in the North Narbaghi area consist of fine-grained rocks that contain plagioclase, with small quartz grains.\n\n\n5\nMineralization\n\n5.1\nCharacteristics of the ore-bearing vein-veinlets and breccias\nBased on detailed field observations, checking of drilling cores, and petrographic studies, mineralization features are described in the following; two different mineralization styles were distinguished in the North Narbaghi Cu-Ag deposit: (1) vein-veinlets and (2) hydrothermal breccia cement. The North Narbaghi area consists of several ore-bearing veins and veinlets that were observed around the main veins (Fig. 4\nA, B). The mineralization (veins and breccia vein) occurs mainly along the NW-SE-trending faults (Fig. 4A) and with an average thickness of 1.5\u00a0m (Fig. 4B, C). The Cu-Ag sulfide veins in the North Narbaghi occur within the Eocene volcanic series. Also, one of the veins is locally hosted in the post-Eocene monzodiorite-diorite (Fig. 2A, B).\nIn the North Narbaghi area, quartz-sulfide stockworks are also common (Fig. 4D) and the vein system here shows large breccia structures (Fig. 4E, F). Veins and veinlets include quartz grains (fine to medium) that infill vugs (Fig. 4G), are crustiform banded (Fig. 4H), and have massive textures within quartz-sulfide veins. Veins and veinlets dominantly consist of quartz with Cu-Fe sulfides (Fig. 5\nA) and sulfosalts that cut the strongly altered andesite and local monzodiorite and diorite.\nHydrothermal breccia can be classified into three stages, including barren varieties, those with Cu-Fe sulfides, and those with sulfosalt and sulfide. In the barren hydrothermal breccia, there is no evidence of any mineralization (Fig. 5B), and brecciation before or during vein formation, because it tends to preferentially occur in rocks with low permeability; it frequently is observed as an early stage infilling process before extensive fragmentation. Cu-Fe sulfides occur throughout the hydrothermal breccia matrix (Fig. 5C) and sulfosalts and sulfides occur within hydrothermal breccias (Fig. 5D-F).\nThe hydrothermal breccia is frequently hosted by volcanic rocks and locally by monzodiorite-diorite. Breccia clasts include andesite, calcite, and lesser monzodiorite-diorite that are angular to subangular (Fig. 5F). The breccia is matrix-supported and cemented by carbonate, kaolinite, dickite, and quartz and includes economically important sulfosalts and base-metal sulfides with fragments of the altered host rock (Fig. 5F). The best and most extensive mineralization occurred in the fractured rocks and was related to hydrothermal alteration, such that high-grade mineralization formed in alteration zones associated with fault systems.\nIt is worth mentioning that supergene weathering in areas with primary mineralization leads to the formation of secondary malachite, chalcocite, covellite, Fe-oxides, and hydroxides (Fig. 5G).\n\n\n5.2\nOre texture and paragenetic sequence\nCrosscutting and other textural relationships of sulfide minerals, such as open-space infill or replacement of minerals, help researchers to recognize the sequence of sulfide precipitation stages (paragenetic relations) that can help evaluate the progress of mineralization (e.g., Fontbote et al., 2017). Based on petrographic and mineralogic studies on thin sections, polished thin sections, and polished sections, mineralization in the North Narbaghi deposit is subdivided into two main stages: a) primary hypogene stage and b) secondary supergene stage. The primary stage can be divided into pre-ore mineralization, main ore bodies, and post-mineralization zones (Fig. 6\n). In the studied area, the mineralized assemblage is simple and includes hypogene chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, covellite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite with variable quartz and calcite.\nStage 1 (pre-ore stage): pre-ore phase is defined by the deposition of the first generation of quartz (Qz1), coexisting and simultaneous with arsenopyrite (Apy1) and pyrite (Py1) occurring in the form of subhedral grains cemented by quartz (Fig. 5A and 7A) that may later be filled by chalcopyrite and sphalerite within the main ore stage of mineralization. Py1, the principal sulfide of pre-ore mineralization, occurs as anhedral-subhedral crystals, Py1 is usually replaced by chalcopyrite and sphalerite of the main stage. Apy1 occurs as anhedral-subhedral grains in spatial contact with Py1 (Fig. 7\nA). Arsenopyrite appears as inclusions, the size of a few millimeters. Apy1 is generally disseminated in the altered host rock in relationship with Py1. The pre-ore stage shows typical silicic and minor sericitic and propylitic alteration to chlorite, pyrite, epidote, calcite, albite, and quartz assemblages.\nStage 2 (main ore stage): Main ore (Cu and Ag) mineralization shows the highest grade of Cu-Ag in the North Narbaghi deposit occurring as base-metal sulfides (chalcopyrite-bornite) and Ag-bearing minerals (tennantite-tetrahedrite). This is the most significant, extensive, and economically important paragenetic stage. This stage can be separated into two substages: sub-stage 2A is specified by chalcopyrite, pyrite 2 (py2), and bornite with vein and hydrothermal breccia (Fig. 7B, C), whereas sub-stage 2B is differentiated by extensive brecciation and precipitation of Ag-bearing phases including tennantite-tetrahedrite and chalcopyrite, also minor amounts of sphalerite and bornite (Fig. 7D-F). Based on textural relationships, the chalcopyrite usually replaces py2 (Fig. 7D) and is itself replaced by Cu-Fe sulfides (bornite), also, replaced by tennantite-tetrahedrite (Fig. 7E, F). Chalcopyrite can be observed as anhedral-subhedral grains coexisting with py2 (Fig. 7E). Red to brown sphalerite occurs as subhedral to anhedral with tennantite-tetrahedrite (Fig. 7D). Tennantite-tetrahedrite is a major sulfosalt in this stage with calcite, sericite, and quartz and it generally has a brecciated texture. High grades of Ag are inside of the tennantite-tetrahedrite coexisting with sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Tennantite-tetrahedrite grains are anhedral and have various sizes. The main ore stage with typical sericitic and argillic alteration types is related to gangue minerals, such as calcite, quartz, and sericite.\n\n\n5.3\nPost-ore stages\/supergene effects\nMineralogical, textural, and geochemical studies show that the most superficial part of the North Narbaghi deposit has been affected by supergene and oxidation effects. This stage in the upper part of the water table leads to oxidation of sulfide minerals to oxide-hydroxide minerals and causes remobilization of copper, resulting in the establishment of Fe oxides and hydroxides. Above the water table, the supergene process affected the base-metal mineralization at the North Narbaghi deposit, the depth of weathering which is related to the water table is approximately 20 to 30\u00a0m.\nThe post-ore stage is determined by the formation of the third generation of quartz (Qz3) and Cu-Fe sulfides consist of chalcocite, malachite, azurite, and covellite (Fig. 7G), framboidal pyrite that fills micro-fractures less than 600\u00a0\u00b5m wide in quartz; this pyrite is characterized as aggregates and isolated grains, 20\u201340\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter (Fig. 7H). Chrysocolla, hematite, and goethite are recognized in the margin and around chalcopyrite and py2 (Fig. 7I). These minerals replace chalcopyrite, bornite, and other primary minerals. In this stage, ore-bearing veins and breccia veins are cut by mm to cm thick veinlets of barren quartz and calcite.\n\n\n5.4\nHydrothermal alteration\nHydrothermal alteration is observed widely around the North Narbaghi breccia and vein-veinlets affecting volcanic and intrusive rocks, generally around fractures through which hydrothermal fluids have migrated and caused mineralization. There are four distinct alteration assemblages identified by differences in mineralogy, zoning relative to the mineralization, type of weathering, and color including silicification and quartz-carbonate, a quartz-sericite-pyrite (QSP), and argillic and propylitic alteration. Silica, QSP, and argillic alteration generally appear around the mineralized zones, if propylitic alteration with less spatial connection to the ore, affects the wall-rock. According to inductively Coupled Plasma \u2013 Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, the altered rocks within the mineralized zones are enriched in Si, Cu, Zn, V, Nd, Ga, Cs, and Rb, and are depleted in Y, Sc, Ga, Nb, and Sr (Fazli et al., 2013).\nThe hydrothermal alteration at the North Narbaghi deposit can be divided in terms of their mineralogy, zoning, color, and spatial connection with mineralization as follows:\nSilicification and quartz-carbonate alteration: This alteration type is recognized by quartz and\/or quartz with carbonate vein-veinlets, breccias, and stockworks (Fig. 8\nA). Hydrothermal breccias are generally cemented by\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0calcite and\/or\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz (irregular and angular shapes) veinlets and stockworks (Fig. 8A). Silicification can be observed next to the mineralized breccia quartz veins related to stockwork and breccia cement. Silicification is identified by vuggy silica bodies of quartz and massive quartz. Vuggy quartz included a groundmass of microcrystalline grains with oxide-hydroxide minerals. In the vuggy quartz, disseminated sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite) occur that have been affected by oxidation and leading to oxidation of sulfide minerals.\nQuartz-sericite-pyrite (QSP): This alteration consists of quartz, sericite, and pyrite with a small amount of chalcopyrite and various amounts of kaolinite (Fig. 8B, C), with an increase in depth that hosts the main orebodies. The assemblage includes pyrite, sericite to illite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0kaolinite, and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0montmorillonite (based on XRD studies) discussed in Fazli and Ghaderi (2019); this assemblage is known as phyllic and is observed between the argillic alteration and the host rock. In the North Narbaghi deposit, phyllic alteration is closely related to mineralization and is characterized by the replacement of rock-forming silicates, such as sericite, quartz, pyrite, epidote, and calcite (Fig. 8B, C), sericite to a variable extent replaces plagioclase.\nArgillic alteration: This alteration zone developed over several meters in the area around mineralized veins and breccias, as well as overprints volcanic, volcaniclastic, and subvolcanic host rocks. The matrix or groundmass of the host rock is relatively altered and has a yellow to brown color. The most widespread hydrothermal alteration is intermediate argillic. X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD) analysis indicates that this alteration is recognized by variable proportions of kaolinite, smectite, illite, chlorite, and calcite assemblages (Fig. 8D). Generally, under the influence of argillic alteration, these minerals partly or completely replace plagioclase and K-feldspar.\nPropylitic alteration: The propylitic alteration is differentiated by its green color. The collection of propylitic alteration minerals includes sericite-epidote-chlorite-calcite and quartz. Plagioclase was partially or completely replaced by sericite, calcite, epidote, chlorite; pyroxene and amphibole were locally completely replaced by a calcite, epidote, and chlorite assemblage. Appreciable quantities of quartz are observed in the matrix and chlorite is locally abundant in this alteration (Fig. 8E). However, chlorite in these assemblages is not considered as a separate alteration type and is generally only weak to moderate.\n\n\n5.5\nGangue minerals\nGangue minerals in the North Narbaghi consist dominantly of quartz and calcite. Quartz is the abundant and most important gangue mineral with great expansion. Based on field and petrographic studies, two generations of quartz can be distinguished. The first generation included crystalline quartz that is cemented and occurs with mineralization and is cut by the second generation of microcrystalline barren quartz (Fig. 8C, F). Silicified rocks and quartz gangue typify epithermal deposits (Taylor, 2007). It usually demonstrates vug infill crustiform textures (Fig. 8G, H). In some parts of the mineralization zones, plumose structures are observed in quartz veins and breccia cement (Fig. 8G). The quartz occurs throughout the mineralization (pre-, main, and post-ore stages), whereas calcite is mainly concentrated in the breccia cement (main mineralization) (Fig. 8H) cut by barren calcite in the post-ore stages (Fig. 8I).\n\n\n\n6\nAnalytical methods\nDetailed fieldwork was carried out in the North Narbaghi area (regional scale and microscopic studies) resulting in the collection of more than 500 samples from surface and drill cores. In total, 114 polished slabs and polished thin sections from samples closely related to mineralization, breccia veins, and host rocks were studied in detail by petrographic and mineralogic methods at the Department of Economic Geology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran\n\n6.1\nSulfur isotope analysis of sulfide minerals\nAfter detailed petrographic studies on mineralized specimens, 12 samples of sulfide minerals (pyrite, chalcopyrite) were chosen as most representative of the source of the mineralizing fluid. Samples for sulfur isotope analysis were chosen from the drill cores and exposed mineralization. After crushing and detailed petrographic studies on specimens, 12 samples of sulfide minerals (pyrite, chalcopyrite) as representative of the source of the mineralizing fluid were handpicked under a binocular microscope and prepared for analysis at the QFIR lab at Queen\u2019s University. Samples were weighed into exetainers, 0.1\u00a0ml of H3PO4 (S.P. 1.91) poured into acid, exetainers are capped and helium-flushed while horizontal. The reaction at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 24 hrs (calcite) or 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 24 hrs (dolomite) was the result of extraction in continuous flow.\n\n\n6.2\nCarbon-oxygen isotope analysis of calcite\nIn the North Narbaghi deposit, 7 hand-picked calcite separates from veins breccias for carbon\u2013oxygen isotopic analysis was done, in order to determine the origin of mineralizing fluids. Identification of carbon isotopic compounds was determined using the method of McCrea (1950). For calcite, CO2 gas was released as a result of the reaction with pure phosphoric acid in a thermostatic bath for 24\u00a0hrs at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. For ankerite and siderite, equilibrium was achieved at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0hrs and 75\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0hrs, respectively. Isotopic ratios were calculated utilizing a MAT 251 mass spectrometer hosted in the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, the China University of Geosciences. Analytical uncertainties for \u03b413C and \u03b418O were both better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u2030. C-O isotope ratios are stated in the formal delta notation and given in \u2030 values relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB).\n\n\n6.3\nFluid inclusion analysis\nFifteen samples of quartz from surface veins and breccia veins were selected (at greater depth) from diamond drill holes and were separated for thermometric analyses. Microthermometric studies were performed on polished slabs (100 to 150\u00a0\u03bcm-thick). Most specimens were selected from quartz-sulfide breccia veins for thermometric analyses. Only fluid inclusions hosted within quartz with the main ore stage were selected, to be sure that the fluid inclusions were the agent of ore formation. No fluid inclusions were studied in calcite because the inclusions are too small for microthermometry. Quartz crystals are generally medium to small in size and trap a small number of fluid inclusions that can be examined. This is a typical character for epithermal deposits (e.g., Bodnar et al., 1985; Yilmaz et al., 2010). Selected sample preparation and microthermometric studies were carried out at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny). Microthermometry experiment was done on a Linkam MDS600 heating-freezing system, the precision of temperature measurement is\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00b0C for \u2212100\u00b0 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C, \u00b11\u00b0C for 25\u00b0 to 400\u00a0\u00b0C, and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C for above 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The heating\/freezing rate was generally 0.5\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C\/min during the fluid inclusion testing process, but reduced to 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C\/min near the freezing point and 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C\/min near the homogenization temperature to capture the phase transformation process. The temperature was calibrated using Synflinc synthetic fluid inclusion standards. Apparent salinities for fluid inclusions are expressed as weight percent NaCl equivalent (wt.% NaCl equiv.) and calculated from the final ice melting temperature (Bodnar, 1994). In addition, the identification of the species in solution was determined from first ice-melting temperatures (Shepherd et al., 1985). The bulk densities and pressures of inclusions were calculated using the equations of Shepherd et al. (1985). For fluids containing the daughter phases, salinities are also stated as wt.% NaCl equiv. and obtained using the final melting temperatures of halite (Tm Halite) (Shepherd et al., 1985).\n\n\n\n7\nResults\n\n7.1\nSulfur isotopes\nSulfur isotope values were determined on the sulfide and sulfosalt minerals separated from 28 selected samples of the main ore stage (veins and breccias) and calculated values for sulfides from the North Narbaghi deposit are listed in Table 1\n. Minerals sampled include pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sulfosalts, such as tennantite-tetrahedrite.\nThe \u03b434S ratios of the sulfide and sulfosalt minerals are limited between \u22121.5 and\u00a0+\u00a03.7 \u2030, averaging 1.6 \u2030. The \u03b434S values for pyrite (0.9 to 3.7 \u2030), chalcopyrite (-1.5 to 0.5 \u2030), and tennantite-tetrahedrite (1.7 to 2.1 \u2030) show a relatively small range. In the chalcopyrite, the \u03b434S values are lighter than other ore stage sulfides from \u22121.5 to 0.5 \u2030 (avg. 1.9 \u2030) (Fig. 9\n).\n\n\n7.2\nCarbon- oxygen isotopes\nThe carbon\u2013oxygen isotope amounts were chosen for seven hydrothermal calcite samples from breccia vein samples. Carbon-oxygen isotopic compositions are listed in Table 2\n and plotted in Fig. 10\n. The \u03b413CPDB values of hydrothermal carbonates in calcite samples vary from \u22122.2 to \u22121.5 \u2030, and the \u03b418OSMOW values of hydrothermal carbonate samples vary between 5.3 and 11.75 \u2030 (Table 2) (Fig. 10A, B).\n\n\n7.3\nFluid inclusion data\n\n7.3.1\nTypes and features of fluid inclusions\nAs defined by Bodnar et al. (1985) and Goldstein (2003), fluid inclusions are divided into three groups, including primary, secondary, and pseudo-secondary relative to the time of trapping. In this paper, we study the primary fluid inclusions in the quartz-sulfide veins of the main ore stage. No measurable fluid inclusions are observed in other steps of the paragenetic sequence. Fluid inclusions occur in various shapes including oval, also elongate, and polygonal shapes are commonly light-colored, and often of these fluid inclusions from 3 to 45\u00a0\u03bcm in size and the dominant dimension range from 10 to 15\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 11\n). Based on the phase relations at room temperature, three types of fluids can be identified in the North Narbaghi deposit: (1) Liquid-rich two-phase (LV) inclusions (Fig. 11A), (2) Vapor-rich, two-phase (VL) inclusions (Fig. 11B), and (3) liquid\u2013vapor inclusions with daughter phase, three-phase (LV\u00a0+\u00a0halite) (Fig. 11C). Pseudo-secondary fluids were also seen during the study of fluid inclusions that formed in internal microfracture planes or within cleavage planes of quartz and have not crossed the mineral border (Fig. 11B, D), these inclusions were not studied.\nAmong the three types of fluid inclusions, the first type is dominant, with more than 85% of the fluid inclusions being liquid-rich inclusions (LV) with relatively regular shapes, mainly about 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter and containing\u00a0\u223c\u00a010 to 40\u00a0vol% vapor at room temperature (Fig. 11A), and homogenized to liquid when heated (LV\u00a0\u2192\u00a0L). This category of fluids occurs in isolated inclusions or clusters along growth zones. Vapor-rich, two-phase (VL) about 60\u201370\u00a0vol% vapor bubble diameters from 10 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm and are circular shapes (Fig. 11 B). The concurrent existence of liquid-rich inclusions (LV) along with vapor-rich inclusions (VL) was seen in the quartz sulfide veins (Fig. 11E, F), indicating episodic boiling.\nLiquid-vapor inclusions with daughter phase, three-phase (LV\u00a0+\u00a0halite) are unusual and asymmetrically distributed almost polygonal shape with an average size of 25\u00a0\u03bcm. Halite crystals were cubic to round in crystal shape, with a small size of about 2\u00a0\u03bcm.\n\n\n7.3.2\nMicrothermometric results\nMicrothermometric analyses were conducted on primary fluid inclusions with a size of\u00a0\u2265\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcm. The characteristics and microthermometric data for the three types of fluids are listed in Table 3\n. No positive ice melting temperature was observed in any fluid inclusions, indicating the absence of clathrates and containing negligible carbon species (Rosso and Bodnar, 1995; Ouyang et al., 2014). Because boiling is indicated by coexisting LV and VL inclusions, the homogenization temperatures require no pressure corrections. Fluid inclusions in the quartz-sulfide veins have homogenization temperature (Th\u00b0C) of 184.3\u2013385.6\u00a0\u00b0C (avg. 284.6\u00a0\u00b0C), although most data placed in the range of 320\u2013340\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 3, Fig. 12\nA). Bulk densities in primary fluid inclusions range from 0.33 to 1.68\u00a0g\/cm3 (avg. 0.87\u00a0g\/cm3) (see Table 3). The measured first ice-melting (Ti) values documented in selected samples are \u221252.4 to \u221270.3\u00a0\u00b0C, Ti in the North Narbaghi deposit far below the eutectic of NaCl\u2013H2O system (\u221221.2\u00a0\u00b0C). This indicates the presence of salts comprising of not only NaCl (e.g., antarcticite\u00a0=\u00a0NaCl\u00b72H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CaCl2\u00b76H2O) (Crawford, 1981; Roedder, 1984; Davis et al., 1990; Dubois and Marignac, 1997). Also, we determine final ice-melting temperatures (Tm) to measure the salinity of the inclusions, according to the melting point depression of the salt solutions. Tm-ice for these inclusions ranges from \u22128.5 to \u221229.5\u00a0\u00b0C with a dominant temperature have a range between \u221225\u00b0 and \u221227\u00a0\u00b0C (avg. \u221225.6\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinities being 12.0 to 29.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv (avg. 21.4\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv). (Table 3, Fig. 12B). Three LV\u00a0+\u00a0S-type inclusions include halite daughter minerals that dissolved at 142.8\u00b0, 148.1\u00b0, and 149\u00a0\u00b0C representing 29.4, 29.6, and 29.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. salinity.\n\n\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\n\n8.1\nOre-forming fluids and components\nFluid inclusion studies and the textural evidence at the North Narbaghi deposit indicate that episodic boiling is the most important and widespread event during mineralization. A main cause of cooling is boiling and the removal of the high-heat vapor phase during depressurization events, progressive cooling, due to boiling and\/or mixing, away from the heat source explains much of the metal zoning observed in different deposit types (Fontbote et al., 2017). In the North Narbaghi deposit coexistence of two types of fluid (VL and LV) at approximately the same temperatures homogenized into liquid and vapor phases, respectively; this indicates that boiling occurred commonly (Fig. 11E, F) in the hydrothermal system (e.g., Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985; White and Hedenquist, 1995; Thiersch et al., 1997; Ronacher et al., 2000; Simmons et al., 2005). If fluid inclusions are trapped contemporaneously, it can be inferred that fluids trapped during the boiling process (Ramboz et al., 1982; Ouyang et al., 2014). The boiling process can cause hydrothermal brecciation development within the ore zones; usually occurrence of boiling at hydrostatic pressure, and as a result, the development of hydrothermal breccias (Muntean and Einaudi, 2001). In more surficial precious metal epithermal deposit types, fluid assisted brecciation is more abundant (cf. J\u00e9brak, 1997). In the North Narbaghi deposit, hydrothermal brecciation illustrates that boiling was an important and the main process for mineralization. In addition, boiling corresponds with the evidence of crustiform banded texture within quartz-sulfide veins at the North Narbaghi (Fig. 4H), i.e., a primary depositional texture inferred to illustrate episodic rapid deposition, during the rapid cooling of magmatic fluids causing overpressure, then sudden failure and opening of fractures that causes flashing (boiling) in shallow hydrothermal systems (Roedder, 1984; Fournier, 1985; Henley and Hughes, 2000; Taylor, 2009; Moncada et al., 2012; Kouhestani et al., 2015; Kouhestani et al., 2018; Kouhestani et al., 2019). Estimates of homogenization temperatures (Th\u00b0C) of fluid inclusions show that wide temperature variations from 184.3\u00b0 to 385.6\u00a0\u00b0C and fluid inclusions in epithermal deposits are generally limited to\u00a0greater than\u00a0100\u00b0 to\u00a0less than\u00a0450\u00a0\u00b0C, more than 90% of the data range between 120\u00b0 and 310\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 12A) (e.g., Bodnar et al., 1985; Bodnar et al., 2014), so Th\u00b0C values of fluid inclusions in this deposit illustrate an epithermal temperature range. Fluid inclusion studies from the North Narbaghi deposit illustrate that ore-forming fluids are classified in the moderate to high salinity variety and moderate to high temperatures. The fluid system started from higher temperatures (avg. 330\u00a0\u00b0C; 306\u00b0 to 385.6\u00a0\u00b0C) from magmatic fluid (early) to moderate temperatures of 184\u2013285\u00a0\u00b0C (avg. 236\u00a0\u00b0C) and continues with the mixing of the magmatic fluid and meteoric water (second ore-stage) (Fig. 12B). Moderate to high salinities in quartz-sulfide veins has been explained in similar epithermal deposits that are either intermediate-sulfidation epithermal, such as Palomosita-Los; Acros; Cobre Babilonia; Real de Guadalupe; Fresnillo and Caylloma (Albinson et al., 2001; John et al., 2003; Echavarria et al., 2006; Camprub\u00ed and Albinson, 2007; Yilmaz et al., 2007; Yilmaz et al., 2010). According to the Ti (-52.4\u00b0 to \u221270.3\u00a0\u00b0C) and observation of halite in fluid inclusions, it is concluded that the composition of the mineralizing fluids was a mixture of NaCl and CaCl2 (NaCl\u00b72H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CaCl2\u00b76H2O\u00a0=\u00a0Antarcticite) salts. The high-salinity fluid inclusions can be interpreted as being derived from magmatic water that helps explain the high salinities of those fluids (Albinson et al., 2001); high to moderate salinity fluids in the North Narbaghi probably reflect brines exsolved from a magmatic source (Ghaderi et al., 2016). The observed range of salinity from hydrothermal systems at the North Narbaghi deposit is consistent with base and precious metal epithermal deposits. In the deeper portions of these hydrothermal systems, high salinity fluids are usually found (range of\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u201340\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv.), which can be one of the main factors of mineralization (Taylor, 2007). Saline fluids have an important role in the migration of base metals (Taylor, 2007). Silver is typically transported as chloride complexes and is deposited as either native metal or argentite-acanthite or occurs in the sulfosalt(s) (tennantite-tetrahedrite) (Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985). Copper is transported as a cuprous chloride complex and is deposited as either CuFeS2 (chalcopyrite) or Cu5FeS4 (bornite), iron is in solution as ferrous chloride complexes and is deposited primarily as sulfides (FeS, FeS2, CuFeS, Cu5FeS4) or oxides (Fe3O4, Fe2O3) that have variable valence states of sulfur and iron (Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985); base-metal and silver transport in shallow hydrothermal systems is by chloride complexes at low pH in that the Cl\u2013 ion is the chief complexing ligand of base metals and Ag (Pokrovski et al., 2005), such as those in Gandy and Abolhassani epithermal deposits (Shamanian et al., 2004). Chloride complexes are usually very important for base-metal and Ag migration, in contrast, the Au(HS) bi-sulfide has a greater role as a low-T carrier for gold transportation (Benning and Seward, 1996; Seward and Barnes, 1997; Shamanian et al., 2004; Williams-Jones et al., 2009).\n\n\n8.2\nEvolution and sources of the ore-forming fluids\nStable isotope geochemical investigations supply beneficial data that help build a comprehensive understanding of the roles of physical parameters on ore deposition, such as pressure, temperature, depth, sources, and progress of ore-forming hydrothermal fluids (e.g., Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Shanks, 2013; Li et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018a, b). Calculated values of sulfur isotopes of chalcopyrite, pyrite, and tennantite-tetrahedrite from the North Narbaghi deposit are listed in Table 1. Pyrite is enriched in heavy \u03b434S isotope values (0.9 to 3.7 \u2030). In the paragenetic mineral assemblage, \u03b434S values for tennantite-tetrahedrite are between 1.7 and 2.1 \u2030, whereas chalcopyrite shows the lowest values (-1.5 to 0.5 \u2030). Ohmoto and Rye (1979) noted that the outstanding specification of epithermal deposits is the magmatic origin of sulfur, commonly having a narrow \u03b434S range around 0 \u2030. In the North Narbaghi deposit, selected sulfide samples, have \u03b434S values in the range of \u22121.5 to\u00a0+\u00a03.7 \u2030 (Fig. 9; Table 1), significantly from a magmatic-derived source (Chaussidon et al., 1989). Also, the \u03b434S ratios of the North Narbaghi deposit compared with deposits in the Yerranderie intermediate-sulfidation epithermal Ag-Au-Pb deposit west-southwest of Sydney (Downes, 2006), intermediate-sulfidation epithermal Au-base metal deposits of Sahinli\/Tespih Dere (Lapseki\/Western Turkey) (Yilmaz et al., 2010), intermediate-sulfidation epithermal precious and base metal Guanajuato deposit, Mexico (Mango et al., 2014), intermediate-sulfidation epithermal Madjarovo Pb\u2013Zn deposits, southeast Bulgaria (Rice et al., 2007), intermediate-sulfidation epithermal Zhijiadi Ag-Pb-Zn deposit, Central North China Craton (Liu et al., 2017), and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal Fresnillo deposits, Mexico (Velador, 2010) (Fig. 13\n) suggest that the North Narbaghi is comparable to intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits.\nC-O isotopes of hydrothermal carbonate minerals could provide constraints on the mechanism for calcite precipitation (Peng and Hu, 2001; Wang et al., 2012). In the diagram of \u03b413C versus \u03b418O (McDonald, 1987), all samples plot in a narrow range and exhibit a linear increase from light to heavy carbon isotopes placing them in the field of magmatic CO2, so are consistent with a magmatic origin for primary ore-forming fluids (Fig. 10A-C). In the epithermal systems, carbon isotope data for calcite typically supports a magmatic origin for calcite, even in systems dominated by meteoric water (e.g., Laforma, Yukon: McInnes et al., 1990; Mt. Skukum, Yukon: McDonald, 1987).\nFluid inclusion microthermometry and petrographic studies have an important role in determining the sources of ore-forming fluids (Wilkinson, 2001). In the homogenization temperature-salinity diagram, fluid salinity shows clear direct relation with Th (homogenization temperatures) (Fig. 12C), which can be interpreted as mixing between magmatic fluids and a cooler, dilute modified meteoric fluid during mineralization at the North Narbaghi. The opposite of this process can be the result of boiling (Canet et al., 2011; Ouyang et al., 2014). A large range of fluids salinity data (12.0 to 29.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv.) from this research can show the mixing of magmatic and modified meteoric fluids. Also, based on these arguments, some evidence, such as the presence of hydrothermal breccias, with the presence of crustiform banded textures, and the other evidence mentioned above, the progression of the North Narbaghi fluid inclusion data could be the result of boiling. During decompression and temperature reduction, on the vapor, the critical curve intersects the two-phase surface (John et al., 2018), and this fluid then condenses a small portion of brine without significantly changing the composition of the expanding vapor; in this situation (temperature below 425\u00a0\u00b0C) vapor and brine reach Cu-Fe sulfide saturation because the temperature is dropping below 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The vapor phase contains H2O, Cu, and even Cl, which can be one of the important factors in transporting metals, silver can be easily transported with chloride complex (Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005; John et al., 2018). High temperature, high metal concentrations, and low pH ore-forming fluids probably result from the mixing of circulating dilute meteoric water (higher pH and cooler) and magmatic brine (Hoshino et al., 2000; Rhys et al., 2020). With the buoyant ascent of the fluid, boiling occurs due to pressure reduction, an increase in pH resulting from a loss of acidic gases that causes a drastic decrease in the metal solubilities changing the saturation of some metals. If such compositional and stability change is effective for metal precipitation, boiling can be the main cause of mineralization. A decrease in the fluid pressure (geostatic) may lead to fluid boiling (liquid flashing to vapor), further volatile exsolution and differential loss of dissolved volatile phases (such as CO2 and H2S-SO2) from the liquid phase, and deposition of gangue and ore minerals is attributed to changes in the pH, cooling, and reduced solubility of precious metals as bisulfide complexes (John et al., 2018; Rhys et al., 2020).\nMagmatic-hydrothermal systems contain HCl, SO2, and HF; where these magmatic gases condense into groundwater, SO2 unstable forming H2SO4 and H2S (4SO2\u00a0+\u00a04H2O\u00a0=\u00a03H2SO4\u00a0+\u00a0H2S; Rye et al., 1992), which results in a very acidic (pH\u00a0\u2264\u00a01) solution that contains subequal amounts of HCl and H2SO4; this acidic solution is strongly out of equilibrium with host rocks and reacts with them through a series of hydrolysis reactions that progressively neutralize acidity and form a characteristic sequence of alteration assemblages (John et al., 2018; Rhys et al., 2020).\nAs discussed, three important factors increase the pH of ore-forming fluids: (a) pH increases with boiling; (b) mixing of orthomagmatic fluids with meteoric water (with high pH and cooler) that causes an increase in pH, and (c) reaction between host rock and ore-forming fluids. An increase in pH causes decreases in the metal-chloride complex solubilities and finally enhances base-metal saturation and precipitation (Hoshino et al., 2000, 2006; John et al., 2018; Rhys et al., 2020).\nOverall, based on comprehensive evidence from C, O, and S stable isotopes, as well as fluid inclusion data, we infer that the ore-forming fluids at the North Narbaghi deposit most likely originated from the post-Eocene magmatism and evolution by mixing with meteoric waters (cooler and high pH) circulating at shallow depths. This evidence is similar to many of the world's largest epithermal deposits (Vidal et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2017a, b; Li et al., 2019).\n\n\n8.3\nMineralization depth and trapping pressure\nAs discussed, boiling has occurred in the North Narbaghi epithermal system; consequently, pressure correction to determine the Th was not needed (Simeone and Simmons, 1999; Tak\u00e1cs et al., 2017); an important point for trapping boiling fluids is that the fluid inclusions must be trapped contemporaneously (Ramboz et al., 1982; Ouyang et al., 2014). The values for Th and corresponding pressures can be utilized for the determination of formation conditions of the ore minerals (Simmons et al., 2005). The coexistence of LV and VL fluid inclusions are common in the same quartz growth zones during ore-bearing vein formation, which suggests that vapor saturation occurred in the ore-forming fluids in the North Narbaghi area. Th ranges of 184.3\u00b0 to 385.6\u00a0\u00b0C, Tm between \u221225\u00b0 and \u221227\u00a0\u00b0C, and salinity between 12.0 and 29.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv. (Fig. 12A, B). Based on fluid inclusion studies the approximate depth of formation deposit can be obtained, microthermometric data illustrate to a depth of only 1800\u00a0m where the only Th value average 300\u00a0\u00b0C is found the maximum and minimum salinity values are reached at the shallowest (700\u00a0m) and deepest (1800\u00a0m) sampling levels, respectively (Fig. 14\n). Evidence of boiling is usually seen in most high-permeability systems, whereas linear thermal profiles are common on the margins. A difference between sampling depth (below the present surface) and paleo-depth calculated by the proposed method could be evidence of post-mineralization erosion.\nIn epithermal-type deposits, brecciated mineralization is very common and forms during hydraulic fracturing and simultaneous decompressive boiling. This hydraulic fracturing occurs when the high pressure of ore-forming fluids surpasses the sum of the overall strength of the host rock and lithostatic pressure, the key feature of exsolution of volatiles (SCF or subcritical two-phase fluid) or two-phase LV boiling is that \u0394V; this mechanical P\u0394V energy is released as a natural consequence of crystallization or decompression of hydrous magmas increasing to produce supralithostatic pressures, then hydrofracturing to even boiling, towards subhydrostatic pressures; this geostatic pressure cycling is key in these systems (Roedder, 1984; Burnham, 1985; Wang et al., 2019). The corresponding depths of the ore deposition at the N-Narbaghi deposit ranged from 700 to 1800\u00a0m below the paleo-water table (Fig. 14), which were approximately the same as other epithermal systems in the world (Henley and Ellis, 1983; Simmons et al., 2005; Pirajno, 2009; Shanks, 2013).\n\n\n8.4\nOre deposition model and genetic type\nEpithermal mineralization is formed with volcanic activity in different tectonic settings such as arc volcanoes; these deposits generally are related to volcanic or shallow intrusive rocks, most commonly in convergent-margin arcs (continental and island arcs) (John et al., 2010). The tectonic setting of epithermal deposits ranges from extensional through neutral to compressional, although several major high-sulfidation deposits formed in localized extensional zones during regional compression. At the regional and district scale, important factors such as emplacement of magma at shallow levels, fault plane inflections, and fault intersections provide fluid conduits (Taylor, 2007; John et al., 2010). Most known deposits are Cenozoic, and many researchers have argued that the age distribution of epithermal gold-silver deposits reflects preferential preservation of the youngest deposits (Papua New Guinea; Sillitoe, 1989; John et al., 2010). The conceptual model for the formation of the North Narbaghi deposit is presented based on regional tectonics, geology, petrographic studies, fluid inclusion analysis, geochemistry, and stable isotope studies. The North Narbaghi Cu-Ag epithermal deposit is hosted by a volcanic and volcaniclastic sequence of Middle Eocene and subvolcanic intrusive bodies of Oligo-Miocene age. The volcaniclastic sequence includes lithic tuffs and andesite, whereas subvolcanic intrusive bodies include calc-alkaline monzodiorite, diorite, and mega-diorite. Mineralization in the North Narbaghi deposit consists of veins that are mainly formed along NW\u2013SE faults. Regional WNW-ESE-trending barren faults, such as Takht-e-Chaman, Rangezard, and Abbas Abad, have an important role in creating NW\u2013SE-trending ore-bearing faults. These structures served as major fluid conduits for the hydrothermal system that formed the North Narbaghi deposit. Faults, especially extensional faults, are key factors in fluid circulation, with fault intersections and fault plane inflections providing zones of brecciation during synchronous movement and vein growth.\nThe North Narbaghi epithermal deposit evolved two types of mineralization, with the vein-type characterized by massive quartz and sulfides; this type occurs at a shallow level and above the breccia veins, also stockwork veins occur as narrow fractures in the upper levels of the hydrothermal system and at depth, we can see the copper-silver breccia in the drilling cores, at a vertical trend that can occur in epithermal deposits (cf. John et al., 2018). Hydromagmatic breccias form by the interaction of magma with externally sourced water, such as groundwater, or rarely, seawater (John et al., 2018). The homogenization temperatures vs. salinity diagram and the above evidence show the incidence of two major processes of boiling and mixing during various stages of mineralization. The origin and precipitation of precious and base metals from hydrothermal fluids in epithermal-type deposits, can be different, such as mixing, boiling, and reaction with host rocks, or integration of these factors (Cooke and McPhail, 2001; Shanks, 2013; Corral et al., 2017; Tindell et al., 2018). The sources of the ore-forming fluids and the precipitation mechanisms of the ore and gangue minerals in the North Narbaghi Cu-Ag deposit are illustrated in Fig. 15\n. The North Narbaghi epithermal deposit is controlled by normal faults and associated with the intermediate argillic alteration. Based on fluid inclusion microthermometry and S-C-O stable isotopes, two fluid types (magmatic and meteoric) were recognized in all mineralization stages; ore-forming fluids (mainly magmatic) ascended along extensional normal faults to higher levels, then the occurrence of boiling and mixing with circulating meteoric water. The mixing process leads to a change in general circumstances of the hydrothermal fluids, disrupting the chemical balance of solutions and, as a result, chemical reactions occur (increasing pH via mixing and F\/R hydrolysis), and lead to the deposition of metals. Especially intermediate-sulfidation epithermal subtype contains remarkable base-metal sulfides as ore constituents (Taylor, 2007). These data are comparable to those found in intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits in Mexico and other intermediate-sulfidation epithermal studies demonstrate that the base metal-rich-Ag veins with Ag\/Au over 100 had high to moderate salinity fluids (greater than 23\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv.) (Vikre, 1989; Albinson et al., 2001). Based on geology, mineral assemblages and ore textures, hydrothermal alteration, and ore-forming hydrothermal fluid characteristics, the North Narbaghi is comparable with intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits, which are described by Einaudi et al. (2003), Sillitoe and Hedenquist (2003), Gemmell (2004), Shamanian et al. (2004), Simmons et al. (2005), Downes (2006), Echavarria et al. (2006), M\u00e1rquez-Zaval\u00eda and Heinrich (2016), and Wang et al. (2019). This is evidenced by the recognition of:\n\n1.\nThe precipitation mechanisms in the North Narbaghi intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit mainly include boiling and mixing; boiling is one of the most important processes in the precipitation of this sub-type of epithermal deposits.\n\n\n2.\nIn the North Narbaghi intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit, the high salinity of the ore-forming hydrothermal fluids can be explained by the high contribution of magmatic water.\n\n\n3.\nThe intermediate-sulfidation epithermal veins at the North Narbaghi are mostly hosted by Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. Intermediate-sulfidation epithermal-type mineralization shows a close relationship with andesitic-dacitic (calc-alkaline) or monzonitic magmatism.\n\n\n4.\nStudied deposits have high contents of base metals and silver and high Ag\/Au; a similar abundance pattern of elements is common in intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits (Einaudi et al., 2003). The North Narbaghi deposit ore assemblage is consistent with intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits with chalcopyrite-pyrite-argentite, as well as tennantite and tetrahedrite. Silver-antimony sulfosalts are common in large low- and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits, whereas silver-antimony-arsenic minerals are somewhat less common (cf. John et al., 2018). Silver is a main economic element in intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits; many silver-rich intermediate-sulfidation epithermal mineralized systems occur in Mexico (e.g., Taxco, Fresnillo, Guanajuato, Pachuca-Real del Monte, and Zacatecas), making it the top silver producer in the world (Camprub\u00ed and Albinson, 2007).\n\n\n5.\nThe clay assemblage in the North Narbaghi intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit is transitional outward to propylitic alteration (epidote-chlorite-carbonate) that may be district-wide in extent. Feldspars were largely stable in fluids that formed low- and intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposits, and host rocks are not as extensively decomposed as those in high-sulfidation districts (cf. John et al., 2018). The clay alteration forms as the result of the generation of CO2-rich steam-heated water on the margin of the system also the mildly acidic (pH\u00a0=\u00a04\u20135) water generates halos of sericite-illite and smectite, as well as kaolinite.\n\n\n\nThis investigation presents a new model for geology, mineralogy, and ore-forming fluid features of silver-rich epithermal deposits in UDMA that includes one of the most prominent epithermal districts of Iran.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nThe North Narbaghi intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit, in the central part of UDMA of Iran, is related to Eocene volcanic and Oligo-Miocene intrusive rocks, controlled primarily by normal faults. Ore mineralization was formed as veins, breccia veins, and breccias surrounded by argillic (intermediate), phyllic, carbonate, and propylitic alteration types. Hypogene and supergene mineralization stages include; (i) pre-ore stage with the first generation of Py1 and Apy, (ii) main ore-stage with sulfides and sulfosalts, such as chalcopyrite, the second generation of pyrite, bornite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, and minor sphalerite, (iii) late-ore stage (supergene weathering process) with the third generation of pyrite, malachite, azurite, chalcocite, covellite, hematite, and goethite. The Th values of main stage fluid inclusions are 184.3\u00b0 to 385.6\u00a0\u00b0C and salinity of 12.0 to 29.7\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv., both Th and salinity are compatible with the conditions of formation for epithermal deposits.\nAs discussed, all data, including fluid inclusions, paragenetic sequence, and stable isotopes, indicate that ore-forming hydrothermal fluids were predominantly magmatic in origin mixing with modified meteoric water at depth through to the site of deposition. In the North Narbaghi deposit, hydrothermal ore-forming fluid pH increase occurred resulting from boiling, mixing of orthomagmatic fluids with meteoric water (with high pH and cooler), and the reaction of hydrothermal fluids with andesitic host rock; eventually, these reactions led to a decrease in the solubility of chloride-metal complexes and precipitation of ore minerals from hydrothermal fluids. Isotopic evidence illustrates that metals and sulfur were derived from a magmatic fluid. Local and regional scale geology, geochemistry, and other important features of the North Narbaghi deposit identify a magmatic-hydrothermal system that evolved upwards into an intermediate-sulfidation epithermal system.\n\n","36":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe main part of the mineral deposits in Western Europe is related to the final assemblage of Pangea at the end of the Variscan orogenic belt evolution (e.g.,\nBouchot et al., 2005; Tim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019). The European Variscan belt hosts several metallogenic provinces, and the mineral deposits present numerous orebodies styles, commonly associated with strike-slip shear zones (Au\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0U), highly differentiated granites and pegmatites (Sn, Nb, Ta, Be, Li), skarns (W, \u00b1Au, \u00b1U), and diverse types of quartz-veins (W, Sn, \u00b1 Au, \u00b1 U) (L\u00f3pez-Moro et al., 2019; Tim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019 and references therein).\nAu, Au-W and W-Sn deposits are widespread in the Galiza Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes Zone (GTMZ) and Central Iberian Zone (Central Iberian zone) of the Iberian Variscan belt (e.g., Corcoesto (Au), Castromil (Au), Tresminas (Au), Jales (Au), Tabua\u00e7o (W-Sn), Barruecopardo (W-Au), Panasqueira (W-Sn), El Cabaco (W-Au), Los Santos (W); Fig. 1\nA-B). The association between gold and tungsten in gold deposits has long been recognized, namely in orogenic gold (OGS) and intrusion-related gold systems (IRGS) (e.g., Goldfarb et al., 2005; Brugger et al., 2008; MacKenzie et al., 2017; Tim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019; Cheval-Garab\u00e9dian et al., 2021). Furthermore, in Au-W deposits, tungstates can predate and\/or are contemporaneous with gold deposition, such as in the Val-d'Or district, Canada (Beaudoin and Pitre 2005), Macraes deposit, in New Zealand (MacKenzie et al., 2017), El Cabaco deposit, in Spain (Tim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) and Bonnac deposit, in French Massif Central (Cheval-Garab\u00e9dian et al., 2021).\nSeveral gold-bearing systems in NW of the Iberian Variscan belt have minor tungsten enrichment, usually as scheelite (CaWO4) and lesser as wolframite ((Fe, Mn)WO4). However, no significant Au-W resource has been identified thus far in Portugal. Despite the economic potential of these tungsten occurrences, little work has been done to examine the relation of tungsten minerals with the gold mineralizing system as a whole.\nData available in the literature on Iberian gold deposits indicate that most of these deposits are closely related to a late-orogenic evolution of the Variscan belt and associated with at least two types of fluids, an aqueous-carbonic and aqueous fluid (e.g., Noronha et al., 2000). The main period of gold deposition occurs associated with the late influx of superficial fluids, with relatively low temperature (<300\u00a0\u00b0C), during the basement uplift, and commonly tungsten was introduced in the early stages of the mineralization process (Noronha et al., 2000; Mateus and Noronha, 2001; Boiron et al., 2003; Vallance et al., 2003; G\u00f3mez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012; Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016).\nNum\u00e3o is a gold deposit in northern Portugal's \u201cDouro Scheelite belt\u201d making it part of the vast Iberian W-Sn metallogenic province (Goinhas 1985; Martins 2012) (Fig. 1C). This belt incorporates many tungsten deposits hosted by calc-silicate rocks, usually as skarns and quartz veins. However, most of them were known long before the belt's Au potential was yet established. Therefore, the Num\u00e3o deposit is an excellent example of an Au-(W) deposit in the Iberian Variscan belt.\nThere is no published data related to the local geology and mineralization type at Num\u00e3o Au-(W) deposit. The main goal of this paper was the acquisition and interpretation of the petrographic, geochemical, and stable isotope data to constrain the formation conditions of the deposit. The obtained results could contribute to an integrated genetic model of Phanerozoic gold deposits in the European Variscan belt. These observations are significant for interpreting relationships between gold and tungsten enrichment processes in other gold deposits in the Iberian Variscan belt. Furthermore, the final achievements can provide future constraints and implications for gold exploration in other Au deposits with similar metal associations and mineralization styles worldwide.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Iberian Variscan belt represents the western part of the Variscan belt and its tectonic evolution is characterized by the interchanging of compressional synorogenic events resulting from Laurussia-Gondwana continental collision after the closure of the Rheic ocean (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Kroner et al., 2016 and references therein). Iberian Variscan Belt is subdivided into six main geotectonic zones considering their tectonic, geologic, metamorphic, and stratigraphic features, from NE to SW: the Cantabrian Zone, the West Asturian Leonese Zone, the Gal\u00edcia Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes Zone, the Central Iberian Zone (Central Iberian zone), the Ossa Morena Zone and the South Portuguese Zone (Julivert et al., 1972; Farias et al., 1987).\nThe first deformation (D1) and second deformation (D2) events (ca. \u223c360\u00a0Ma and \u223c350\u00a0Ma, respectively: Dallmeyer et al., 1997; Azor et al., 2019 and references therein) are related to the main collisional stage that led to crustal thickening accompanied by Barrovian metamorphism (e.g.,\nDias da Silva et al., 2020) and magmatism at \u223c340\u00a0Ma (e.g.,\nPereira et al., 2018). The formation of the upright to slightly overturned structures in the internal domains and recumbent folds characterized the D1 event (Dias et al., 2016). D2 deformation event was mainly restricted to the emplacement of the allochthonous and parautochthonous units in the NW Iberian. The D3 event (ca. 315\u2013305\u00a0Ma: Dallmeyer et al., 1997; Azor et al., 2019 references therein) corresponds to an intracontinental (transpressional regime) deformation event and marks the end of the collision process in Iberian Massif (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Dias and Ribeiro 1995). In the D3 event, the NE-SW \u03c31 developed tight to open folds, ductile shear zones, WNW-ESE and ENE-WSW, and vertical strike-slip faults: NNE-SSW, and WNW-ESE systems (Ribeiro 1974; Iglesias and Ribeiro, 1981; Marques et al., 2002). Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas and the Penacova-R\u00e9gua-Verin regional faults are examples of the NNE\u2013SSW system (Fig. 1C: VMF and PRVF, respectively). A latter N-S to NW-SE \u03c31 was responsible for the intense fracturing of NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and N-S, and reactivation of previous fracture systems, developed during the late-Variscan period constrained between 310 and 270\u00a0Ma (Marques et al., 2002 and references therein) (Fig. 1B-C).\n\n2.1\nRegional-deposit scale\nThe Num\u00e3o area is located in the Central Iberian zone, in northern Portugal. This zone represents the autochthonous of the axial domain of the Iberian Variscan belt and contains Gondwanan affinity rocks (e.g.,\nMurphy et al., 2008; Pastor-Gal\u00e1n et al., 2013; Guti\u00e9rrez-Marco et al., 2017) with Barrovian and Buchan metamorphism with numerous igneous rocks (e.g.,\nD\u00edez Balda et al., 1995; Dias et al., 1998; Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2018). The Num\u00e3o area is within the east part of a narrow W-E trending metamorphic belt (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Moreira et al., 2010). This belt is surrounded by two syn-D3 two-mica granite massifs (Ferreira da Silva et al., 1989; Pereira et al., 2018). Additionally, two small circumscribed granitic plutons intruded the metasediments from the W-E-metamorphic belt in this area (Ferreira da Silva et al., 1989): i) syn-to late-D3 muscovite- biotite granite; and, ii) post-D3 biotite-rich granite (Fig. 2\n).\nThe W-E metamorphic belt is composed of metasediments to the Pre-Ordovician \u201cSchist Greywacke Complex\u201d (SGC) integrated into the so-called \u201cDouro Group\u201d (Sousa 1982). From stratigraphical and palaeogeographical information, the SGC has been defined as the Super Group D\u00farico\u2013Beir\u00e3o, consisting of \u201cDouro group\u201d and \u201cBeiras group\u201d (Oliveira et al., 1992). Several formations composed the \u201cDouro Group\u201d: Bateiras, Ervedosa do Douro, Rio Pinh\u00e3o, Pinh\u00e3o and Desejosa, from the older to the younger age (Fig. 2; Sousa, 1982).\nIn the Num\u00e3o area, there are predominantly metasedimentary rocks from two different units, Pinh\u00e3o and Desejosa, of the \u201cDouro group\u201d, characterized by metapelitic rocks interlayered by metagreywacke and calc-silicate rocks. The Pinh\u00e3o unit, consisting of a greenish-grey colored, thin bedding sequence, is characterized by psammitic (quartz-rich) and pelitic (mica-rich) layers with magnetite crystals and more irregularly pyrite crystals. The Desejosa unit is defined by the presence of stripped phyllites resulting from a thin inter-changing of dark with light layers and metagreywackes (Fig. 2). Calcium-rich layers in the metasedimentary sequences from the SGC are common and represented by calc-silicate rocks (Ferreira da Silva et al., 1989).\nThe lithologies in the northern part of the Pinh\u00e3o and Desejosa Formations have been metamorphosed and range from chlorite to biotite facies, increasing grade toward the syn-kinematic two-mica granite massifs (Ferreira da Silva et al., 1989). The main Variscan deformation phase in the area is D1 and induced the formation of broad zones gently folded bounded by coeval narrow bands emphasizing more substantial deformation (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Moreira et al., 2010). The D1 folds trend WNW-ESE, with sub-horizontal fold axes and has associated an S1 cleavage. During the D3, upright open folds with associated crenulation cleavage (S3) were formed; these folds are almost homoaxial with D1 folds.\nThis sequence corresponds to a succession of large amplitude anticlines and synclines, with a main axial plane trending N100\u00b0-150\u00b0E (Fig. 1C: Ribeiro et al., 1990; Moreira et al., 2010). This geometry shows an extensive area with intense strain partitioning with lateral continuity, interrupted by NNE-SSW faults, such as the Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas fault. Other regional fault systems crosscut the E\u2013W, NNW\u2013SSE, and NW\u2013SE. The ca. 220\u00a0km long Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas fault (Fig. 1C) shows a left-lateral offset of up to 9\u00a0km in the Variscan basement resulting from the recurrent activity. The NNE\u2013SSW trending faults were considered primary dextral faults and later became sinistral during reactivation in the late Variscan and Alpine Orogeny (Ribeiro et al., 1990; Marques et al., 2002, Cabral, 2012).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling technique and study methodology\nThis study is based on data from 41 diamond drill cores and underground mining works from the Num\u00e3o prospect. The sampling strategy was to obtain a demonstrative set of samples from all host rock types, mineralized structures, and hydrothermal alterations. In addition, detailed mapping of structural and lithological features was conducted in the Num\u00e3o underground mining works and outcrops in surrounding areas.\n\n3.1\nPetrography and mineralogy\nDetailed petrography was performed in fifty thin polished sections to characterize the host rock, hydrothermal alteration, and mineralized structures. The petrographic studies were performed at the Institute of Earth Sciences (ICT-University of Porto) by transmitted and reflected light microscopy. Complementary studies for mineral characterization assemblages were done at the Materials Centre of the University of Porto (CEMUP) (equipment: FEI Quanta 400 FEG-ESEM\/EDAX Genesis X4M). Abbreviations of minerals were adopted from Kretz (1983) and Whitney and Evans (2010).\n\n\n3.2\nMineral chemistry\nChemical analyses in silicate and sulfide minerals were performed at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University (Brno, Czech Republic) using an electron microprobe (EPMA), CAMECA SX100 model. Major elements were determined at 15\u00a0keV accelerating voltage, with a 10\u00a0nA beam current (5\u00a0\u03bcm focused beam) an acquisition time between 10 and 20\u00a0s for X-ray peak and background.\nIn sulfides, approximately 100 analyses of trace elements (Au, Ag, Sb, Pb, Bi, Te, Se, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Hg) were performed on arsenopyrite and pyrite and also in other gold mineralization-related minerals. The operating conditions for the analysis were a 15 and 25\u00a0keV accelerating voltage, with a 20\u00a0nA beam current (2\u00a0\u03bcm focused beam), and 120\u2013180\u00a0s count time. The detection limits were determined for the individual measurement. The acquired results are present in Supplementary material 1 and 2, showing only the measurements above the detection limit for each chemical element. Natural and synthetic sulfides, oxides, and native elements were used as reference materials.\n\n\n3.3\nGeochemistry\nThe geochemical analysis is based on the multi-element data from twelve drill cores provided by MINAPORT company. The multi-element chemical analyses were acquired by ALS Global Ltd. at their laboratories in Sevilha, Spain, during 2017, 2019, and 2020. The chemical reports contain multi-element analyses, including some major and trace elements. The company only reports the data from mineralized samples on multi-element geochemical data sets. Samples were chosen based on host rock lithology, mineralization style, and gold grade. ALS Website: \nhttps:\/\/www.alsglobal.com\/en\/services-and-products\/geochemistry\/geochemistry-testing-and-analysis\/whole-rock-analysis-and-lithogeochemistry\n.\n\n\n3.4\nPrincipal component analysis\nThe principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate statistical technique used to reduce large datasets (Jolliffe and Cadima, 2016). PCA has been applied all over the years to describe geochemical\/geological processes and provide a practical tool to analyze and interpret large geochemical datasets in a meaningful way (Grunsky et al., 2014; Grunsky and Caritat, 2020).\nThe geochemical datasets from mining companies usually revealed some issues, such as closure effect, missing values, censoring, components not measured, merging, leveling different datasets, and inadequate geochemical data (e.g., Aitchison 1986; Van Den Boogaart et al., 2006; Grunsky et al., 2014; Grunsky and Caritat, 2020). The main problem of the Num\u00e3o geochemical dataset is an inadequate sampling for the geochemical analyzes. The mining company only sent geochemical analyzes of the drill core samples with mineralized structures. So the PCA was used to discriminate the gold mineralization pathfinders, hydrothermal alteration, and intending to constrain some lithological controls if they are present.\nThe raw data in the Num\u00e3o dataset were examined before PCA. Cd, Co, Ga, Mo, U, and Sr have been excluded because >40% of the data show values below or equal to the detection limit (e.g., Hron et al., 2010). The remaining geochemical data contained the complete set of elements without censored data. Accordingly, to Filzmoser et al. (2009), the centered log-ratio (CRL) is a data transformation method using the ratio between each variable and the geometric mean of all values from the dataset and taking the natural logarithm to avoid the closure effect (all components sum to a constant, in our case 100%). A CLR transformation was applied to the remaining data.\nPCA is a non-supervised statistical method, and there are several types of PCA (e.g., R-mode and Q-mode) (Neff, 1994; Grunsky et al., 2014) such as i) R-mode is based on variables (chemical elements) and its associations with a set of objects, and ii) Q-mode is based on objects, in our case samples. RQ-mode PCA is helpful for simultaneous interpretation of both element and sample variance on a single diagram \u2013 biplot (variables\u00a0=\u00a0elements; objects\u00a0=\u00a0samples) (Gabriel, 1971; Klovan and Imbrie, 1971; Zhou et al., 1983; Grunsky 2001). The ioGAS\u2122 software (REFLEX 2019) was used to make the statistical calculations (RQ-mode PCA) and graphics.\n\n\n3.5\nIsotopes analysis\nIsotope analyses were made on quartz and arsenopyrite once these two minerals are the main minerals associated with gold at the Num\u00e3o deposit. These two minerals were sampled from different mineralized structures. The oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotope compositions were measured in bulk samples because it was impossible to separate the observed different generations of quartz and arsenopyrite. Six quartz bulk samples were subjected to hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis and five arsenopyrite bulk samples to sulfur isotope analysis. One pyrite sample from the barren host rocks from Schist Greywacke Complex (SGC) was analyzed. All samples of quartz and arsenopyrite separates were hand-picked and checked under a binocular microscope to ensure the purity of >98%. The isotope analyses were accomplished in the Stable Isotopes Laboratory of Salamanca University, Spain. The methodologies descriptions were provided by of Stable Isotopes Laboratory of Salamanca University (https:\/\/nucleus.usal.es\/en\/services).\n\n3.5.1\nOxygen isotopes\nThe oxygen isotope data were acquired in quartz concentrates using a laser fluorination method. This method involves the total sample reaction with excess ClF3 using a CO2 laser as a heat source. The combustion resulted in a 100% release of O2 from the silica lattice. Then, the O2 was converted to CO2 by the reaction with hot graphite and examined by a VG SIRA II spectrometer. Reproducibility is better than \u00b10.2\u2030 (1\u03c3). Results are displayed in Table 2 and reported in standard notation (\u03b418O) as per mil (\u2030) deviations from the Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW).\n\n\n3.5.2\nHydrogen isotope\nPure quartz concentrates were heated to 150\u00a0\u00b0C under a high vacuum to release unstable volatiles. The released water was then reduced to H2 and passed slowly through a tube containing a quantity of metallic uranium inside a furnace at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The quantitative gas measurement was made in a Hg manometer before collecting using a Toeppler pump.\nDuplicate analyses of international water standards (V-SMOW) gave a reproducibility of \u00b12\u2030. Analytical results are present in Table 2, as \u03b4D notation as per mil (\u2030) variations from the international V-SMOW standard.\n\n\n3.5.3\nSulfur isotope\nArsenopyrite and pyrite concentrates were analyzed by conventional techniques (Robinson and Kusakabe 1975). The SO2 gas was liberated by combusting the sulfides under a vacuum with excess Cu2O at 1075\u00a0\u00b0C. These gases were analyzed on a VG Isotech SIRA II mass spectrometer. All the analytical uncertainties were better than \u00b10.2\u2030. The \u03b434S data are reported as per mil (\u2030) deviations from the Vienna Ca\u00f1on Diablo Troilite (V-CDT) standard. Table 2 summarized the analytical results.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nHost rocks\nThe rocks exposed in underground works and drilling cores are of various lithologies (Fig. 3\nA-B): i) metapelites (phyllites and quartzphyllites), ii) metagreywackes, iii) quartz-feldspathic rocks, and iv) calc-silicate rocks. In most cases, no clear boundaries between these lithologies can be drawn despite being strongly interlayered on a meter-to-centimeter scale. The contacts between the different rock types are mostly gradual, striking approximately E-W bedding with a near-vertical dip.\nMetapelites levels are fine-grained (<100\u00a0\u03bcm) with a spaced to continuous foliation (S1) on a macroscopic and microscopic scale (Fig. 3C) coincident with the bedding (S0) (N100\u00b0\u2013120\u00b0). The foliation is defined by the micas (mainly muscovite and chlorite) with euhedral to subhedral dispersed sulfides, mainly pyrite (Fig. 4\nA), defining a lepidoblastic to granolepidoblastic texture.\nMetagreywacke levels show a massive dark aspect, fine-grained and thin-bedded (Fig. 3D). Variable proportions of quartz and micas (biotite, muscovite) and minor potassium feldspar constitute the main mineral association (Fig. 4B). Traces of tourmaline, zircon, rutile, titanite, and ilmenite occur as accessory phases (Fig. 4C). It displays a fine-grained granoblastic texture, with irregular quartz grain boundaries intergrown with the adjacent micas. The biotite and tourmaline blastesis are associated with a silicification episode.\nQuartz-feldspathic rocks (Fig. 3E) display a pale yellow aspect and a granoblastic texture without preferential orientation. The quartz is present in grains with irregular boundaries, the potassium feldspar, and plagioclases crystals commonly altered to white mica (sericite) (Fig. 4E). Trace amounts of epidote and titanite aggregates are frequent (Fig. 4D).\nThe calc-silicate rocks (Fig. 3F) are granular with a mineral assemblage characterized by quartz, plagioclase, amphiboles, epidote, titanite, garnets, and minor amounts of calcite (Fig. 4F). Scheelite (Sch-1), when present, is disseminated (0.1\u20130.5\u00a0mm) among these minerals, together with apatite, rutile, pyrrhotite, ilmenite, and fluorite. Garnet occurs as massive to granular aggregates in the groundmass. Amphiboles are green to greyish green and form radiating clusters with acicular crystals.\n\n\n4.2\nGold mineralized structures\nThe metasedimentary host rocks are strongly crosscut by the main vein system (N-S to N40\u00b0; 50\u00b0W to sub-vertical) (Fig. 5\nA-B). The vein system consists of subparallel veins with variable spacing and thickness depending on the host lithology. Within the metapelites, the mineralized veins have a small spacing (10\u201320\u00a0cm), less thickness, and are more scarce (<3 veins\/meter). However, in more competent and chemically reactive host rocks (quartz-rich metagreywacke and\/or calc-silicate rocks), the veins are locally anastomosed and have a larger thickness (>50\u00a0cm), forming a network vein, like a stockwork. At the macroscopic scale, the gold-bearing mineralization is characterized by conjugate vein sets of the quartz-sulfide veinlets. This type of structure only observed in the metagreywacke and calc-silicate sequences is represented by a dense network of subvertical, NNE-SSW, and E-W trending joints with a 3 to 5\u00a0m spacing. The veins exhibit horizontal lineations (Fig. 5G-H). In addition, the veins crosscut bedding and S1 foliation but lack any displacement.\nAnother mineralized vein system is sub-parallel to the calc-silicate and the metagreywacke layers (S1\u00a0=\u00a0S0), N100\u00b0-115\u00b0; 70\u00b0W \u2013 subvertical, corresponding to S3. Finally, there is a barren flat vein system N80\u00b0; 20\u00b0N older than the mineralized zones, which sometimes appear folded.\nThe bulk of the economic mineralization at Num\u00e3o area, taking into account field and petrographic observations, and mineral chemistry (see section 4.5), includes three mineralization types (Fig. 5C-D-E-F): Type 1 \u2013 disseminated sulfides; Type 2 \u2013 arsenopyrite-quartz veins; and Type 3 \u2013 sulfides-scheelite-quartz veins. The high-grade mineralized structures correspond to Types 2 and Type 3, whereas Type 1 mineralization is minor.\nType 1 is mainly hosted by metagreywackes, calc-silicate rocks (Fig. 5C), rare quartz-feldspathic rocks, and metapelites. The mineral assemblage is arsenopyrite (Apy-1) and scheelite (Sch-1), with minor pyrrhotite, pyrite, and sphalerite (Fig. 6\nA-B). Apy-1 occurs as euhedral crystals ranging in size from 0.8 to 4\u00a0mm. Sch-1 occurs as disseminated subhedral crystals, ranging from 2 to 5\u00a0mm in size, disseminated and occasionally forming small veinlets.\nMineralization Type 2 is developed in all host lithologies. The most abundant mineral is Apy-2, which occurs in massive aggregates (2 to 20\u00a0mm) as small euhedral to subhedral crystals. Association of Pb-Bi-S mineral phases and native bismuth are frequent, infilling intergranular spaces between arsenopyrite crystals and disseminated in the rock matrix.\nMineralization Type 3 corresponds to sulfides-scheelite-quartz veins hosted by all host lithologies, more locally and well developed in the calc-silicate sequences. Ore minerals comprise Sch-2, Apy-1, Apy-2, and minor chalcopyrite. Arsenopyrite forms massive coarse aggregates (2\u201310\u00a0mm dimensions) (Fig. 6C). Bismuthinite as needle-like to woolly crystals are also typical and associated with native bismuth and Au-Ag mineral phases.\n\n\n4.3\nOre mineralogy\nThe mineral assemblages correspond to three main deposition stages. A stage-1 is represented by scheelite (Sch-1), in association with pyrrhotite, pyrite, and sphalerite with minor chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite (Apy-1) occurring disseminated in host rocks, apart from metapelites. Stage-2 corresponds to the main sulfide stage, represented by the second generation of scheelite (Sch-2) associated with sulfides and by arsenopyrite (Apy-1 and Apy-2), chalcopyrite, native bismuth, maldonite, native gold, and minor pyrite. Stage 3, characterized by bismuthinite, galena, Au-Ag alloy (low-fineness gold) and Bi-Pb-S sulfosalts.\nThe gold minerals occur in three different modes (Fig. 6D-E-F): i) native-Au and maldonite (Au2Bi), along with native-Bi as droplets in arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite; ii) electrum infilling interstitial cavities between arsenopyrite crystals and\/or in its microfractures and, iii) Au-Ag minerals phases as free particles in the silicate matrix of the host rocks and grain boundaries. The size of gold particles ranges from 3\u00a0\u00b5m to 50\u00a0\u00b5m and is found in all mineralization types.\n\n\n4.4\nHydrothermal alterations\nThe hydrothermal alteration zones at the Num\u00e3o deposit are restricted to the vicinity of the mineralized zones and comprised silicification, muscovitization, sericitization, potassium feldspar alteration, chloritization, epidotization, and carbonatization (Fig. 7\n).\n\n4.4.1\nSilicification\nElongated stretched quartz crystals represent the early hydrothermal alteration alongside minor sulfides, sericite, and muscovite flakes. It is pervasive in all lithologies and developed in all three mineralized structures. The effect of silicification decreases with distance from the mineralized bodies. Quartz occurs as i) early deformed coarse-grained crystals with dynamic recrystallization shown by deformation bands and subgranulation with abundant fluid inclusions planes (Fig. 7A); ii) fine-grained polygonal quartz associated with arsenopyrite and, iii) later quartz associated with potassium feldspar, chlorite aggregates and muscovite selvage (Fig. 7A-B).\n\n\n4.4.2\nMuscovitization and sericitization\nMuscovitization is commonly represented as disseminated large muscovite flakes associated with mineralized structures from Type-1 in metagreywackes, or veinlets and radial aggregates in the wall-rock of Type 3 (Fig. 7C). Sericitization is usually represented by fine-grained white mica filling microcracks or disseminated grains coexisting with fine-grained quartz (Fig. 7D-E). When present, biotite, potassium feldspar, and plagioclase crystals were partly or replaced by sericite (Fig. 7D-E).\n\n\n4.4.3\nPotassium feldspar alteration and chloritization\nPotassium feldspar predominantly occurs in sulfide-quartz veins with chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sericite (Fig. 7D-E) and is frequent in some of the boundaries of arsenopyrite crystals. Occasionally, chlorite crystals show anomalously blue, brown, or purple interference colors and are observed in the mineralized zones and the host rocks. It can occur, forming flakes and aggregates filling spaces between the quartz and the carbonate minerals (Fig. 7E-F); within the veins and veinlets; in small intergranular patches disperse in the host rock or idiomorphic shape, usually forming radial aggregates in veinlets and vugs associated with quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0potassium feldspar (adularia).\n\n\n4.4.4\nEpidotization and carbonatization\nEpidote occurs preferentially when the veins cut the calc-silicate and quartz-feldspathic rocks (Fig. 7E). It is present in minor fractures, replacing primary plagioclase, and, in most cases, forms mineral associations with quartz, chlorite, and sometimes calcite, pyrite, and, pyrrhotite. Carbonatization comprises calcite as the essential alteration mineral (Fig. 7D-E), filling spaces between crystals or small veinlets crosscutting all structures. Titanite is frequent as an alteration product and occurs mainly due to the alteration of ferromagnesian minerals associated with chlorite, quartz, and calcite.\n\n\n\n4.5\nMineral chemistry\nMineral chemistry analysis was undertaken in several metamorphic, hydrothermal alteration, and ore minerals related to gold mineralization to characterize the paragenetic sequence.\n\n4.5.1\nHost rocks\nEpidote, feldspar, titanite, amphiboles were analyzed by microprobe in the host rock. The EMPA data are shown in Supplementary material 1.\nMicroprobe analyses of epidote in quartz-feldspathic and calc-silicate levels indicate that these minerals are a solid solution between epidote and clinozoisite (Supplementary material 1). The contents are as follows: SiO2 (35.60% to 40.36%), CaO (16.36% to 25.31%), Al2O3 (23.99% to 34.60%), and FeOT (0.36% to 8.90%).\nPotassium feldspar was recognized in most of the samples and had a similar chemical composition. Microanalyses showed Na (7.98 to 12.11\u00a0wt% Na2O) enrichment with a plagioclase composition of Ab56 and Ab99 (Supplementary material 1). Na-rich plagioclase is frequent in metagreywacke, while andesine is more common in calc-silicate rocks.\nTitanite has a homogeneous composition without significant differences between crystals. Al2O3 (2.78\u201311.87\u00a0wt%) and Fe2O3 (0.15\u20130.68\u00a0wt%) contents are always low. Some positive analysis with Nb and Sn content.\nThe EMPA data obtained for amphiboles are shown in Supplementary material 1. The Al2O3 content ranges from 2.25% to 28.27%, CaO from 12.52% to 24.42%, FeOT from 4.62% to17.82%, MgO from 0.74% to 13.81%, and Na2O from 0.11% to 0.30%. The amphiboles from cal-silicate sequences plot in the Ca-rich dominant varieties in the field of the actinolite and ferro-sadanagaite types (Supplementary material 1).\nThe EPMA analysis results, calculated cations, and end-member compositions of garnet crystals are given in Supplementary material 1. Garnet crystals were mainly grossular (Gro; 37.89%\u201349.28%) with some spessartine (Spe; 27.17%\u201330.80%) and almandine (15.59%\u201328.32%), mainly with small amounts of andradite.\n\n\n4.5.2\nOre minerals and hydrothermal alteration products\nScheelite, gold, arsenopyrite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, bismuthinite, and sphalerite are the most abundant minerals in Num\u00e3o mineralized bodies. The EMPA data from these minerals are shown in Supplementary material 2. Chlorite, epidote, and feldspar are related to hydrothermal alteration products and their chemical composition reported on Supplementary material 1.\nSch-1 and Sch-2 revealed similar chemical compositions with a pure phase, without relevant trace elements (e.g., Mo). Arsenopyrite is typically homogenous and shows As contents of 31.28 and 33.25 at.%, with most values clustering around 32.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 at.% (Supplementary material 2). No clear correlation between As and Fe concentrations in Apy is reported. Other elements analyzed were Ag, Te, Sb, Pb, Bi, and Au. Only a few analyses showed positive values of Pb (0.07\u20130.15\u00a0wt%).\nAccording to EPMA data, pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, bismuthinite, and sphalerite are typical stoichiometric compositions (Supplementary material 2). The microprobe analyses performed in galena crystals showed high content of Ag (up to 1.6\u00a0wt%) and Bi (up to 3.3\u00a0wt%), indicating a simultaneous substitution of Pb+2 for Bi+3 and Ag+ (Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016). A few analyses in bismuthinite crystals revealed Pb contents upper the detection limit.\nConsidering the complex intergrowths between Bi-Pb sulfosalts and host minerals, the thin structure makes the EMPA analysis inaccurate.\nChemical analysis from gold minerals revealed two distinct generations (Supplementary material 2; Fig. 6). The gold content of Au-1 varies from 75.54 to 93.85\u00a0wt%, which is significantly higher than that of Au-2 (45.35 to 68.73\u00a0wt% Au). The Au-1 is generally variable in Ag (6.61 to 24.37\u00a0wt%) compared to the Au-2. According to the calculation formula for Au fineness defined by Fisher (1945), the average fineness of Au-1 and Au-2 are 841 and 663, respectively. The high fineness of gold (Au-1) and maldonite occurs preferentially within chalcopyrite and in arsenopyrite. The low fineness gold (Au-2) mainly occurs in fractures or grain boundaries in Apy-1 and Apy-2 and rock matrix.\nThe chemical classification of Num\u00e3o hydrothermal chlorites is reported on EM 1, and according to Bayliss (1975) belongs to the clinochlore and chamosite group. Epidote from hydrothermal alteration zones was Fe-poor with alumina-rich minerals and belonged to the clinozoisite subgroup (Supplementary material 1). Carbonates from all kinds of host rocks show a restricted and pure composition as calcite (CaO\u00a0=\u00a056.15\u00a0wt% without any other element).\n\n\n\n4.6\nMulti-element geochemical drill hole data\nThe statistical summary of multi-element geochemistry of the drill hole samples from the study area is given in Supplementary material 3. Variations in the major, minor, and trace elements contents of samples from different drill holes can be identified using boxplots (Fig. 8\n). The major elements' content variations differ by two or three orders of magnitude (Fig. 8). These samples contain 1.44 to 12.55\u00a0wt% of Al and 1.30 to 9.73\u00a0wt% of Fe. The Mg, Ca, Na, K, and S contents range from thousands of ppm to 8.66\u00a0wt% (Fig. 8), with Ti, Mn, and S contents ranging from \u223c40 to \u223c8000\u00a0ppm (Fig. 8). Taking into account the trace elements which are not related to the metallic elements, Ba concentrations are highly variable (2\u20131300\u00a0ppm; Fig. 8) with other elements present at concentrations lower than \u223c151\u00a0ppm (Be, Co, Cr, La, Ni, Sc, and V).\nComparing samples from different drill holes indicate that Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Bi, Sb, and W contents are less variable than other elements with content variations differing two or three orders of magnitude (Fig. 8). The As concentrations are highly variable, ranging from 2.5 to 82300\u00a0ppm. From the mine and hand specimen scales, a relation between sulfides minerals and scheelite seems to exist, but as a whole, the Au-W correlation is very weak (R\u00a0=\u00a00.2). Besides, there is a similar weak Au-W correlation in most drill holes at the scale of individual drill holes. Contrarily, there is a stronger correlation in someone, like in the drill hole represented in Fig. 9\n, representing an R\u00a0=\u00a00.7, reflecting the general overlap of Au and W enrichment zones.\n\n4.6.1\nPrincipal component analysis\nPCA was carried out on the 29 analyzed elements for 1172 samples from 12 drill cores from de Num\u00e3o area. A scree plot of the PC (Fig. 10\n) shows that the first four components explain the highest variance of the data (77%) (see Table 1\n). Biplots of RQ1\u2013RQ2, RQ2\u2013RQ3, RQ3\u2013RQ4 are shown in Fig. 10. The elements represent the degree of relative enrichment\/depletion of each sample site by proximity to the position of the chemical elements.\nAs shown in Fig. 10B, there is one major vector group in PC1-PC-2 space: W plot positively in PC1 space; two major element vectors group Au-As-Cu-Bi and Sb-S, positively attributed to both PC1 and PC2. K is positively attributed to PC2. Ni-Fe-Sc-V-Mg-Ba-Be vector group plot positively to PC2. Cr and Al-La too. All other elements plot negative in the PC1-PC2 space. Au-As-Cu-Bi and Sb-S groups have the same trend of the K in PC2-PC3 space. Ca-Na group plot in the positive PC3 space.\nThe Sb eigenvector has an opposite direction to the S eigenvector in PC4 space, increasing vector length in that order. Au-As-Cu-Bi group displaying smaller vector lengths. The variables associated with PC4 and PC5 have a negligible negative association.\n\n\n\n4.7\nGeothermometers\nThe Apy composition (Supplementary material 2) used as a geothermometer gives a temperature interval of 381\u00b0 to 502\u00a0\u00b0C (Kretschmar and Scott, 1976; Sharp et al., 1985). Apy analyses with As\u00a0>\u00a033 at.% were interpreted as late re-equilibrium with Po\u00a0+\u00a0fluid enriched in S and As (Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016). The majority of the analysis in arsenopyrite was below their respective detection limits for trace elements.\nIn addition, using the chlorite geothermometers defined by Kranidiotis and MacLean, 1987 and Cathelineau, 1988, the estimated temperature ranges between 264\u00b0 to 341\u00a0\u00b0C (Supplementary material 1). Thus, despite being empirical and not fully quantitative thermometers, chlorite and arsenopyrite geothermometry can be used to estimate the relative temperature of minerals precipitation.\n\n\n4.8\nStable isotope data\nOxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotope data are provided in Table 2\n. The quartz oxygen isotope compositions from the mineralized structures at Num\u00e3o are clustered, ranging between +13.0 to +13.5\u2030. The isotopic compositions for \u03b418Ofluids were calculated assuming equilibrium between fluids and minerals and based on the estimated formation temperature from chlorite and arsenopyrite geothermometers, ranging from +4.7 to +11.3\u2030 (Bottinga and Javoy 1973; Matsuhisa et al., 1979). The \u03b4D ranges from \u221272 to \u221283.6\u2030. The \u03b434S analysis on arsenopyrite yielded values from \u22127.5 to \u22127\u2030. The sulfur isotope data showed clear grouped values deducing an isotopic homogeneity for the source of metals for gold mineralization (Table 2).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nMineralization controls\nThe mineralized structures at Num\u00e3o deposit are veins developed in extension fractures, as reflected by the growth directions of the gangue crystals orthogonal to the vein walls (Fig. 5G-H). The veins are normally fault-controlled, crosscutting bedding and\/or regional foliation, and are post-peak of regional metamorphism. The proximity of the Num\u00e3o deposit (approximately 7.5\u00a0km apart) and similar orientations of the mineralized veins with the structural corridor of NNE-trending of the Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas fault suggest that the vein sets were formed during the same hydrothermal event. Second or third-order structures of the NNE-trending primary fault system could host the mineralized structures. The relative predominance of brittle deformation mechanisms leads to the generation of overlaid fracturing episodes and minerals precipitation, thus indicating a rapid increase of the crustal uplift rates and a notable migration of mineralizing fluids towards dilatational structures intimately related to strain accommodation within fault zones or in Num\u00e3o case to strain partitioning in the metamorphic sequences with different chemical compositions and rheological features, as suggested by some authors (e.g., Mateus and Noronha, 2001). The mineralized body networks (stockwork) are well-developed into competent rock units compared to adjacent metapelites, which fractured easily and created dilatancy. These high competency sites can focus fluid flow and have negative fluid pressures, resulting in extensional veining and dilation (Ridley, 1993).\nThe diversity of hydrothermal alterations shows good consistency with observed host rocks mineral assemblage, reflecting differences in the protolith composition. Comparing the chemical composition of the host rocks only with metamorphic mineral assemblages, with the chemical composition of rocks from proximal alteration zones, the last ones contain more silica, Fe-Mg-K-Al minerals, and Ca-rich minerals, manifested by a higher content of quartz, chlorite, and muscovite, and clinozoisite, epidote, and calcite respectively.\n\n\n5.2\nTiming of scheelite and gold precipitation\nScheelite-1 is, in fact, the early ore mineral and is present in calc-silicate rocks. Similar scheelite-bearing calc-silicate rocks of the skarnoid type are present in levels strongly folded, from the Schist-Greywacke Complex of Upper Precambrian age and also in similar Silurian sequences. In calc-silicate rocks only affected by regional metamorphism, we cannot exclude the possibility that some tungsten was already pre-concentrated in the sedimentary series before metamorphism because scheelite is sometimes present (Noronha, 1976; Arribas, 1979; Pellitero, 1980). However, it is hard to exclude the possibility that the W is related to granite intrusions when the calc-silicate rock levels occur near the contact with granite intrusions (Derr\u00e9 et al., 1982). Sch-2 is present in the mineralized veins when they crosscut calc-silicate rocks, and it is coarser than Sch-1 and contemporaneous of arsenopyrite, and we can refer to a lithological control for its occurrence.\nOnce arsenopyrite is the main sulfide hosting the gold minerals, the arsenopyrite geothermometer is a practical method to constrain the temperature conditions for mineralization precipitation. Based on the textural relationships and chemical compositions, the arsenopyrite geothermometer reached estimated temperatures ranging from 381\u00b0 to 502\u00a0\u00b0C to the arsenopyrite precipitation. The chlorite geothermometer gave estimated temperatures varying from 264\u00b0 to 341\u00a0\u00b0C. These temperature intervals support the textural relationships indicating both minerals are not coeval, which corroborate the paragenetic relationship (chlorite infilling fractures of arsenopyrite).\nThe hypogene gold at Num\u00e3o was characterized by the two different types of gold occurrence representing the evolution of the same hydrothermal gold precipitation event. The first one is characterized by maldonite and high fineness gold hosted in chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite (fineness 841). The second one (low-fineness gold) occurs after a decrease in temperature and sulfur fugacity, alongside sulfide precipitation. A low-fineness gold (fineness 663) is associated with minerals from the Pb\u2013Bi\u2013S assemblages, grain boundaries, and silicate matrix of the host rocks. Several authors in Northern Portugal reported these two gold assemblages (e.g., Limarinho deposit (Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016), Penedono deposit (Neiva et al., 2019), and Bigorne deposit (Leal et al., 2021)).\n\n\n5.3\nMetal associations\nThe PCA from the Num\u00e3o geochemical data established the major multi-element trends, gold mineralization pathfinders, insights of host rocks composition, and hydrothermal processes. The PC1 shows a positive correlation between Au-As-Cu-Bi-W, which may reflect the petrographic observations that Au mineralization is associated with sulfides, mainly arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, and scheelite.\nIn terms of sample variance, mineralized samples are coupled with mainly Au-As-Cu-Bi-W vectors, while the non-mineralized samples plot against these higher-order PCs vector groups (Fig. 11\n).\nThe relative importance of Au and W decreases from PC1 to PC2, with PC1 showing a positive correlation between both and PC2 a negative one. This fact indicates that the variations of W and Au are not regular and suggest that these elements are not related to the same mineralization process. The W is only correlated with Au when the quartz veins crosscut calc-silicate rocks with Sch-1, suggesting that Sch-2 can result from the recrystallization process of Sch-1.\nThe PC3 and PC4 represent a residual process in this mineralization system, such as minor Ag and Pb mineralization. Ag and Pb vectors are supported by identifying Au-Ag minerals phases and Pb sulfosalts related to the rocks matrix.\nEigenvectors for Ca and Na plot negative to PC2, as Ti and Mn to a lesser degree, whereas K, Al, Mg, and Fe plot favorable. From the samples plotted in Fig. 11, we conclude that the PC1 varies as Au and \/or W grades and accounted for most variation. The elements which plot positive in the PC1 space correspond to the gold mineralization pathfinders. The variation accounted for by PC2 is likely to show evidence for host rock lithology and chemical changes resulting from hydrothermal alteration. The K vector plot against Na and Ca vectors in PC2 space shows the association of muscovitization and metagreywackes and quartz-feldspathic rocks. The PCA classified the initial geochemical data according to each mineralization type and the degree of mineralization (unmineralized samples and mineralized samples for explanations, see Fig. 11). Type-1 and type-2 correspond to Au-enriched samples, and Type-3 to Au-W enriched samples. Towards the more positive side of PC1 space (Fig. 11), samples become weakly enriched and finally strongly mineralized, as represented by the green arrow.\nThe Num\u00e3o mineralization type-1 and type-2 plot positive in PC2 space, while type-3 plot negative in PC2 space, apart from some overlap among Au-W- and Au\u2013only-enriched samples. Observation of PC2-PC3 biplot (Fig. 11C) showing the link between Au-only-enriched samples with K, Al, Mg, and Fe vectors, associated with metapelites and metagreywacke host rocks, in contrast with Au-W-enriched samples, which are plotted in the same field of Ca, Na and Mn, reflecting the influence of calc-silicate rocks. The Ca, Na, and Mn could reflect the mineralogy of the calc-silicate rocks, such as garnets and actinolites.\n\n\n5.4\nFluids source\nThe Dfluid falls in metamorphic and magmatic waters fields. In Num\u00e3o, the calculated \u03b418Ofluids varies from +11.2 to +8.5\u2030 at crystallization temperatures between 502\u00a0\u00b0C and 381\u00a0\u00b0C. These values show lower oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions than the magmatic water or metamorphic, corresponding to modified waters resulting from the interaction rock-fluid (Taylor, 1974, 1979). The lighter \u03b418O fluids values (+4.7 to +5.2\u2030) in equilibrium with the chlorite indicate a meteoric signature, inferred by several authors from the fluid inclusion data in other deposits (Noronha et al., 2000; Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016 and references therein).\nWhole-rock SGC metasediments have \u03b418OSMOW values of 13.1 and 13.4\u2030, and \u03b4DSMOW values of \u221267.3 and \u221252.6\u2030 (Chicharro et al., 2016). The metamorphosed sedimentary rocks for low- to medium-grade yield similar values (Sheppard 1986; Hoefs 2018). Recently Bark et al. (2020) interpret that oxygen isotope compositions greater than +8\u2030 could result from the surface or near-surface processes related to sedimentation, diagenesis, or low-temperature hydrothermal alterations (Taylor 1980), proposing that the fluid cannot be exclusively magmatic (McCuaig and Kerrich, 1998). The isotope data from the Num\u00e3o deposit may thus suggest a mixed fluid source of modified fluids and surficial fluids as described in other gold deposits in the European Variscan belt (e.g.,\nBoiron et al., 1996; Noronha et al., 2000; Mateus and Noronha 2001; Boiron et al., 2003; Bouchot et al., 2005). The sulfur isotope results clustered around \u22127.3\u2030, which may suggest a single uniform metal source. These values fall in the sedimentary and metamorphic 34S-values of important geological reservoirs fields (Hoefs 2018), discarding a purely magmatic source. However, the S-data are not similar to the obtained values for SGC barren pyrites (12\u2030). According to Gaboury (2019), the gold can be sourced from the carbon- and pyrite-rich sedimentary rocks and generated or liberated under the same metamorphic reaction conditions at the greenschist \u2013 amphibolite facies boundary, which could reflect the mineralization process in Num\u00e3o.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe Num\u00e3o deposit, formed towards the end of the Variscan orogenic evolution, represents the economic products of two different hydrothermal mineralizing events, an early W-(As) and Au-Ag-Bi-(As) event with a close link with the late-variscan network of re-activated crustal-scale faults (e.g., Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas fault). The initial ore-forming fluids were either magmatic water, possibly derived from a concealed granite body and\/or metamorphic waters, resulting from the interaction fluid-rock, directly transported via deep fractures from deeper crustal levels, and meteoric water played an increasingly important role during the fluid evolution and in particular in the late stage. In Spain, comparable W and W-Au deposits show similar features, suggesting that the hydrothermal history was controlled by large-scale Late-Variscan tectonic processes (Tim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019). These two hydrothermal events may have upgraded the gold grade in this type of gold deposit, which is well-represented through the European Variscan belt.\nThe mineralized bodies display features of \u201cOrogenic Gold systems\u201d at a relatively deep emplacement level (mesozonal), and Reduced Intrusion-Related-Gold-systems (RIRGS) with a spatial\u2013temporal link with post-D3 Variscan peraluminous intrusion emplacement. The genetic classification of the Num\u00e3o deposit is equivocal and for the authors seems pretty insignificant in this context, due to the ambiguous definitions of these classes globally.\n\n","37":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe processes of fluid focussing into faults and shear zones are reasonably well understood, highlighting the relationship between deformation, the creation and sealing of transient fracture permeabilities, and associated fluid-pressure cycling (Cox et al., 1987, 1991, 2001; Sibson et al., 1988; Eisenlohr et al., 1989; Hronsky et al., 1990; Groves et al., 1995; Sibson, 2001). Much of this work is based on the analyses of exhumed fault and vein systems of lode-gold deposits. The deposits illustrate the three-dimensional geometry and connectivity of fluid-plumbing structures particularly well (Oliver et al., 1990; Ridley, 1993; Cox, 1995; Sibson, 1996, 2020; Goldfarb et al., 2001). What is less well known, is how the large quantities of fluid required for economic-grade gold mineralization are sourced and channelled from a larger region of fluid production with a more distributed fluid flow (e.g., Cox et al., 2001; Cox 2005). Pervasive fluid flow implies lower volumes of fluid per volume of rock and thereby complicates the delineation and tracking of regional fluid migration, when this would have important implications for exploration and the identification of potential fluid sinks that connect to the regional pathways.\nIn the Sheba-Fairview Complex (SFC) of gold mines in the Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB), past and present mining has concentrated on a large number of discrete quartz-carbonate-sulphide orebodies, so-called \u2018reefs\u2019 or \u2018fractures\u2019. Mineralization is primarily hosted by metasedimentary rocks of the Moodies and Fig Tree groups that are preserved in two regional-scale, fault-bounded, and complexly refolded synclines (Ulundi and Eureka synclines). Many of the currently and historically mined orebodies occur along or in proximity to the central Sheba Fault, the first-order structure that separates the Eureka and Ulundi synclines (Fig. 1\n; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017). The largest and presently mined orebodies, however, are hosted in the hanging wall of the Sheba Fault by a lithologically heterogeneous, isoclinally folded succession that forms the base of the Fig Tree Group in the Ulundi Syncline. In contrast, many smaller high-grade reefs form seemingly isolated quartz-sulphide lodes, with no obvious connection to the Sheba Fault. The different geometries, highly variable orientations (shallow and steep, bedding-parallel or sharply discordant), different structural controls, and varying location of mineralized reefs, have resulted in rather diverging views about the origin and timing of the gold mineralization (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1976, 1986; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; de Ronde et al., 1992; Robertson et al., 1994; Ward, 1995; Ward and Wilson, 1998; Dirks et al., 2009, 2013; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018, 2019; Pintos Cerda et al., 2020). This raises questions as to (1) the controls on the regional fluid flow in the SFC, and (2) the processes of fluid focussing into individual structures and the linkage between the regional fluid flow pattern and localized fluid sinks.\nThe aim of this paper is, thus, twofold. In a first step, the paper presents a synopsis of the controls of mineralized reefs - the fluid sinks - in the SFC based on regional studies and more recent works (e.g., Ramsay, 1963; Anhaeusser, 1976, 1986; Viljoen, 1982; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Schouwstra and de Villiers, 1988; Robertson et al., 1994; Ward, 1995; Ward and Wilson, 1998; Dirks et al., 2009, 2013; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018, 2019; Agangi et al., 2019; Pintos Cerda et al., 2020). In a second step, the paper describes and characterizes the controls of the Thomas fracture system as a case history for a well-mineralized, but isolated and discordant quartz-vein system in the Moodies Group. These fracture systems have, until now, received little attention in the literature when they document mineralization and fluid channelling outside and in some distance from larger structures. Before this background, the paper aims to identify factors that determine the regional permeability structure underlying the SFC and the links between regional flow paths and zones of localized fluid channelling and mineralization\u00a0(fluid sinks).\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe BGB is one of the type regions for models of Archaean geodynamic processes in the world. The northeast trending belt is made up of the Barberton Supergroup, consisting of 3550 to 3215\u00a0Ma volcanic and mainly clastic sedimentary sequences that are surrounded by a ca. 3500\u20133200\u00a0Ma tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite (TTG) terrain and\u00a0\u223c3100\u00a0Ma granite plutons (Fig. 1; de Wit, 1982; Anhaeusser, 1986; Kamo and Davis, 1994; Lowe and Byerly, 2007). The Barberton Supergroup is subdivided into the basal Onverwacht Group (>3547 to ca. 3260\u00a0Ma), consisting of mainly mafic and ultramafic lava flows (Viljoen and Viljoen, 1969; Williams and Furnell, 1979; Byerly et al., 1996), the unconformably overlying metaturbiditic Fig Tree Group (3260 to 3225\u00a0Ma) (Lowe and Byerly, 1999, 2007) and the youngest Moodies Group (3225 to ca. 3210\u00a0Ma), comprising an up to 3700\u00a0m thick mainly coarse-clastic sequence that is unconformable with the older, underlying units (Heubeck and Lowe, 1994; Heubeck et al., 2013; Byerly et al., 2019). Gold is primarily mined from the northwestern margin of the BGB, more specifically in the crescent-shaped region comprising the Ulundi and Eureka synclines (Fig. 1). Here, the Sheba and Fairview mines have produced over 10 Moz of gold in their near-continuous, more than 130-year-long mining history (Anhaeusser, 1976; Dirks et al., 2009; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017).\nAlthough very well preserved in many aspects, the rocks of the BGB have undergone multiple episodes of deformation and metamorphism (Table 1\n; e.g., Ramsay, 1963; de Wit, 1982; de Ronde and de Wit, 1994; Lowe et al., 1999). Notwithstanding the ongoing debate about the role of gravitationally-driven, vertical tectonics (Anhaeusser, 1976; van Kranendonk, 2011) versus horizontal, subduction-like tectonics (e.g., de Wit et al., 1992; de Ronde and de Wit, 1994; Moyen et al., 2006; Schoene et al., 2008; Kisters et al., 2010), the deformation of the belt is commonly described in terms of four major deformational events (Table 1). The first recognizable deformation event along the northern margin of the belt, D2, records NW-SE shortening associated with steepening and folding of Onverwacht and Fig Tree Group rocks. This event is commonly correlated with the amalgamation of a southern and a northern terrain underlying the BGB, occurring at ca. 3230\u20133225\u00a0Ma (de Ronde and de Wit, 1994; Kamo and Davis, 1994). Alternative models advocate the shortening observed due to the gravitational sinking of greenstones coeval with the formation of the TTG complexes (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1981; van Kranendonk, 2011). D2 also coincided with the emplacement of TTG granitoid plutons along the northern margin of the belt, including the 3227\u00a0Ma Kaap Valley Tonalite (Fig. 1; Kamo and Davis, 1994) and the change in sedimentation from the deep- to shallow-marine-dominated Fig Tree Group to the unconformably overlying terrigenous Moodies Group at 3225\u00a0Ma (Lowe et al., 1999). Regional NW-SE shortening and concomitant orogen-parallel extension accompanied deposition of the Moodies Group, but the formation of the regional NE-SW trending folds in the BGB was only complete after sedimentation of the Moodies Group (Heubeck et al., 2013). The timing of this deformation remains unclear, and it is also uncertain whether this deformation was part of a progressive shortening event (D2\/3) or a separate, largely co-axial deformation phase (e.g., de Ronde and de Wit, 1994; Kisters et al., 2003). The distinct refolding of F3 folds that has affected the large Eureka and Ulundi synclines seems restricted to the Barberton region and is not observed elsewhere in the BGB (see Table 1 and section 2.1 below; Ramsay, 1963; de Ronde and de Wit, 1994). Late-stage normal faulting (D4) is widely recorded in the BGB and underground workings of the Barberton mines where the faults crosscut the gold mineralization within the Sheba and Fairview mines (e.g., de Ronde and de Wit, 1994; Dirks et al., 2013; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018, 2019), but the timing of the extensional features is also not clear. Throughout this evolution, the central parts of the greenstone belt have only undergone lower greenschist-facies grades of metamorphism (e.g., Cloete, 1999).\n\n2.1\nGeological setting of Sheba-Fairview Complex (SFC)\nThe SFC is situated in the Sheba Hills, dominated by the arcuate first-order Ulundi and Eureka synclines (Figs. 1, 2\n). The two synclines are juxtaposed across the central Sheba fault zone along which many of the larger orebodies are located. For the most part, the Ulundi Syncline is cored by the metaturbiditic Fig Tree Group comprised of the basal, shale-dominated, 20\u201350\u00a0m thick Ulundi Formation, the central, greywacke-rich, and up to 1000\u00a0m thick Sheba Formation, and the uppermost, 200\u2013500\u00a0m thick and mainly pelitic Belvue Road Formation (Lowe and Byerly, 1999, 2007; Byerly et al., 2019). The Eureka Syncline in the structural footwall of the Sheba Fault is cored by Moodies Group and minor Fig Tree Group metasediments in the west. The sequence includes mainly quartzose, lithic, and feldspathic sandstone and conglomerate, but also siltstone, shale and minor mafic lava. The Moodies Group is subdivided into three formations, namely the basal Clutha Formation, the central Joe\u2019s Luck Formation, and the upper Baviaanskop Formation (Fig. 2; Anhaeusser, 1976; Heubeck and Lowe, 1999; Lowe and Byerly, 1999; Heubeck et al., 2013). Anhaeusser (1976) separated lithostratigraphic units within the formations, a subdivision that will be used and referred to in this paper (Fig. 2). In the west and north, the Eureka Syncline is within the hanging wall of the Lily Fault that juxtaposes Moodies and minor Fig Tree Group rocks of the syncline against rocks of the Onverwacht Group (Weltevreden Formation; Figs. 1, 2). The footwall of the Lily Fault is marked by large slivers of both Moodies and Fig Tree groups that are imbricated into Onverwacht Group serpentinite and talc-carbonate schist of the Jamestown Schist Belt (e.g., Ramsay, 1963; Munyai et al., 2011 and figures within). In the far west, the greenstone sequence is juxtaposed against the 3227\u00a0Ma Kaap Valley Tonalite and, to the northeast, by both the 3106\u00a0Ma Nelspruit Batholith and the composite, 3300\u20133105\u00a0Ma Stentor Pluton (Fig. 1; Kamo and Davis, 1994). In the south and east, the structurally higher, but stratigraphically lower successions (Fig Tree and Onverwacht groups) within the Ulundi Syncline are bound by the NE-trending Barbrook Fault that separates the synclines from the central portion of the belt (Fig. 1).\nThe prominent, crescent-shaped geometry of the Ulundi and Eureka synclines and bounding Lily, Sheba and Barbrook faults results from the refolding of the originally NE-SW trending folds (F3a) and faults about a NW-SE trending fold hinge (F3b) (Ramsay, 1963; de Ronde and de Wit, 1994). The first-generation F3a synclines are non-cylindrical folds with tight interlimb angles of 30\u00b0-50\u00b0 and normal northern and western limbs with overturned southern and eastern limbs, giving them a distinct NW vergence. The folds and bounding faults, thus, resemble a NW-verging fold-and-thrust complex. The Eureka Syncline plunges steeply to the south and west, while the Ulundi Syncline is a doubly plunging fold with southwesterly and westerly plunges along the northeastern closure and easterly plunges along the southern closure (Anhaeusser, 1976). The F3b phase involves the refolding of the F3a folds about a moderately (45-55\u00b0) SE-plunging axis, normal to the regional trend of the belt. The F3b folds are close folds with interlimb angles of 60-70\u00b0, with larger interlimb angles of up to 120\u00b0 in the far eastern parts of the Ulundi Syncline against the Barbrook Fault (Fig. 1; Ramsay, 1963). Ramsay (1963) proposed the arcuate shape to have formed by two orthogonal fold phases during D3. However, the refolding is not evident elsewhere in the BGB and two alternative, more local models for the curvature of the folds are discussed in the literature. Anhaeusser (1976, 1981) suggests refolding of the folds due to the diapiric rise of the Nelspruit Batholith and Kaap Valley Pluton to the immediate west and northwest of the BGB. Similarly, van Kranendonk (2011) suggested that the folding of the greenstone units occurred by the sinking of cool greenstone drips into partially molten and rising TTG melts. An alternative explanation is the refolding of the folds in response to progressive NW-SE directed shortening, and the thrusting and bending of the greenstone strata as an orocline or salient (e.g., Marshak, 1988, 2004; Weil and Sussman, 2004) around the competent TTG-granite plutons that acted as rigid basement buttresses (van Eeden, 1941; de Wit et al., 1987; Lowe et al., 1999; Kisters et al., 2003). In this case, the curvature of the folds is controlled by the geometry of the TTG-greenstone basement during progressive shortening of the belt.\nA second characteristic of the region is the presence of isoclinal, narrow (40\u201380\u00a0m half wavelength), high-amplitude (> 500\u00a0m) folds. These isoclinal folds infold rocks of the Onverwacht Group (Weltevreden Formation) into Fig Tree Group metasedimentary rocks over a width of ca. 300\u2013400\u00a0m at the base of the Ulundi Syncline (see 3.2 below). Previously described as the Sheba Anticlinorium (Fig. 2; Ramsay, 1963; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Ward and Wilson, 1998), the Weltevreden Formation folds are developed on both the normal northern and the overturned southern limb of the Ulundi Syncline, indicating a pre-D3 origin. The anticlinal structures show strongly curved hinge-lines and, in places, tubular shapes characteristic of sheath folds (see Fig. 5 below). In the mine workings on the northern limb of the Ulundi Syncline, the sheath-like folds show a down-plunge extent of\u00a0>\u00a02\u00a0km with steep SE plunges, parallel to the large-scale F3b fold that refolds the Ulundi and Eureka synclines. The significance of these high-strain folds on a regional scale and for the evolution of the greenstone belt as a whole is not understood, but the folds cored by ultramafic schists are of paramount significance for the localization of some of the largest orebodies in the SFC (see 3.2 below; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019).\n\n\n\n3\nControls of gold mineralization within the Sheba-Fairview Complex\nMineralized reefs are observed throughout the supracrustal sequence, from the Weltevreden Formation of the uppermost Onverwacht Group, through the Fig Tree Group and into the Moodies Group (Figs. 2, 3\n). The vast majority of auriferous reefs, however, cluster over an area of approximately 30\u00a0km2 in the region of the F3b hinge of the Eureka and Ulundi synclines, more specifically the inner arc of the Eureka Syncline and outer arc of the Ulundi Syncline (Figs. 2, 3). Some 85 % of the historically and currently mined reefs are developed in this region between the Fairview Mine in the SW and the Sheba Mine in the NE (Fig. 2). The auriferous reefs show three main structural associations (Fig. 3), namely (1) a close spatial relation with the central Sheba Fault and typically in the immediate footwall of the fault (Fig. 3a; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Robertson et al., 1994; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017), (2) orebodies associated with the infolded anticlinal structures of Weltevreden Formation rocks, particularly along the contacts between retrogressed ultramafic rocks and Fig Tree metaturbidites (Fig. 3b; Schouwstra, 1995; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019; Pintos Cerda et al., 2020), and (3) bedding-discordant reefs and fractures mainly in the Moodies Group, but also in the Fig Tree Group (Fig. 3c) that are spatially isolated (> 1 km) from the Sheba Fault. The following provides a brief characterization of the main controls of the orebodies.\n\n3.1\nMineralization along the central Sheba Fault\nThe central, refolded Sheba Fault curves through over 90\u00b0 and maintains relatively consistent steep dips (55-60\u00b0) to the south, southeast and east with widths ranging between a few meters and up to 75\u00a0m wide. The fault juxtaposes the Eureka and Ulundi synclines (Anhaeusser, 1976) and cuts up the Moodies Group stratigraphy, from north to south, highlighting the early thrust-fault kinematics during D2 (Fig. 2; Visser, 1956). As a result, shale and greywacke units of the basal Ulundi Formation of the Fig Tree Group are in contact with Moodies Group quartzite and conglomerate in the north and west (Fig. 2), whereas serpentinite and fuchsite-quartz schist of the Weltevreden Formation are juxtaposed against Moodies Group rocks along the western and southern strike extent of the fault. The top-to-the-NW thrust sense of movement and distinctly NW vergence of the synclines are likely related, but the absolute timing of the deformation (D3) is unknown. Since then, the fault has undergone multiple reactivations, especially strike-slip reactivations during the refolding (F3b) of the F3a synclines (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1986; Robertson et al., 1994; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019).\nThe juxtaposition of different rock types as well as the repeated reactivation of the fault account for the distinct mixed brittle-ductile character of the fault (the term brittle is used here to denote discontinuous deformation and fracture\/vein formation, whereas ductile is used to indicate continuous deformation, associated foliation development, and transposition\/folding of fabrics e.g., Sibson et al. (1988); Fossen and Cavalcante (2017)). Wall-rock brecciation, associated quartz-carbonate veining, intense silicification, and carbonate and sericite alteration are mainly developed in Moodies Group rocks in the footwall of the Sheba Fault (Fig. 4\n\n). This zone below the Fig Tree-Moodies contact corresponds to the fractured\/veined damage zone of the fault and the alteration can be traced for several tens of meters into the footwall of the fault (Fig. 4). The core of the fault is located in the weaker shale-rich base of the Fig Tree Group or talc-carbonate schist of the Weltevreden Formation. The fault core has experienced carbonate alteration, silicification, the pervasive transposition of bedding and quartz veins, and intense foliation development with, in places, mylonitic fabrics (Fig. 4).\nHistorically and currently mined orebodies include Great She, Nil Desperandum, Sheba West, Royal Sheba, Oriental Quarry, and Golden Quarry (Figs. 2,\u00a03a). The orebodies are exclusively hosted by Moodies Group rocks in the direct footwall and damage zone of the Sheba Fault (Fig. 3a, 4; Gribnitz, 1964; Viljoen, 1982; Anhaeusser, 1986; Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Ward and Wilson, 1998; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017). Economic-grade gold mineralization is developed as quartz-carbonate (-sulphide) shoots that are spatially confined to undulations along the fault zone that correspond to jog geometries that formed during the strike-slip reactivation of the fault during D3 deformation (Fig. 2; Ward and Wilson, 1998; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017). The famous Golden Quarry (Figs. 2,\u00a03a) that sparked the gold rush into the Sheba Hills and the origin of the Barberton gold mines, forms a steeply plunging, carrot-shaped quartz-carbonate vein stockwork to a depth of 350\u00a0m (Pearton and Viljoen, 2017) hosted by the competent basal conglomerate (MdB) of the Moodies Group. In the case of the currently mined Sheba West orebody, the Sheba Fault juxtaposes the Moodies Group feldspathic quartzites (MdQ1 of the Clutha Formation) with the ultramafic quartz-fuchsite and talc-carbonate schists of the Weltevreden Formation in the core of the Eldorado Anticline (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.2\nGold mineralization related to the Sheba Anticlinorium\nMost of the currently mined and larger orebodies occur in the hanging wall of the central Sheba Fault, in the lower parts of the Fig Tree Group on the northern, normal limb of the Ulundi Syncline. Mineralization is confined to lithological contacts between altered mafic- to ultramafic rocks of the tightly infolded and\/or thrusted Weltevreden Formation anticlines and the metasedimentary rocks of the Fig Tree Group (Figs. 2,\u00a03b). The juxtaposition of ductile and brittle deformation styles suggest that these lithological contacts represented prominent rheological contrasts.\nAt Fairview Mine, the two economically most important orebodies are developed as two subparallel, steeply-plunging (ca. 55-70\u00b0) ore shoots (Figs. 5a, c). The central Main Reef Complex (MRC) shows a down-plunge extent of\u00a0>\u00a02\u00a0km, while the smaller Main Reef Thrust (MRT) orebody to the west of the MRC has been explored to depths of ca. 1\u00a0km (Fig. 5c). The MRC is situated between serpentinites of the Weltevreden Formation in the core of the Birthday No. 2 Anticline and metagreywacke and minor shale of the Fig Tree Group (Figs. 5a, c). This contact along the upper, normal limb of the Birthday No. 2 Anticline corresponds to a low-displacement (meters to tens of meters) brittle-ductile shear zone (Fig. 5a; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019). The deformation is the result of oblique flexural slip associated with the refolding (F3b) of the Ulundi Syncline, where strain was localized into the rheologically weaker serpentinite units and promoting brittle fracturing (veining) that hosts gold mineralization within the more competent Fig Tree Group metasediments (Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019). Mineralization is confined to undulations and dilational jog geometries along the sheared contacts. Orebodies in the jogs reach strike lengths of 40\u201360\u00a0m and a thickness of 8\u201315\u00a0m, underlining the pronounced shoot-like geometry of the mineralization. High-grade mineralization is associated with graphite-rich shale units in the Fig Tree Group where gold is closely associated with late-stage arsenopyrite and minor pyrite (Schouwstra and de Villiers, 1988; Robertson et al., 1994; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019). Both the MRC and MRT ore shoots plunge parallel to the F3b hinge of the Ulundi Syncline and document a remarkable hinge-parallel permeability structure and fluid flow (Fig. 5c; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019).\nAt Sheba Mine, the main ore shoot is referred to as the Zwartkoppie (ZK) shoot (Figs. 5b, c). Similar to the MRT and MRC orebodies, the ZK shoot is also situated along the contact between ultramafic and metasedimentary rocks with a similar overall southeasterly plunge (Figs. 3b, 5b, c). However, the ZK shoot cuts through several of the stacked anticlines, from the Zwartkoppie Anticline that is developed throughout the SFC, into the overlying tubular Birthday No. 1 and eventually topmost Birthday No. 2 Anticline at depth (Fig. 5c). In contrast to the MRC and MRT, mineralization in the ZK shoot is mainly developed in the green fuchsite-quartz schist (green schist, as fuchsite is green in colour) derived from alteration of the ultramafic Weltevreden Formation (Schouwstra, 1995; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017; Pintos Cerda et al., 2020). Economic-grade mineralization along the ZK shoot is either (1) bedding-parallel and developed along the contact between the green schist and an overlying chert unit or Fig Tree greywacke, locally referred to as the main fracture, or (2) along crosscutting brittle-ductile shears that transgress the green schist, the so-called cross-fractures (steeply-dipping fractures cut across the green fuchsite-quartz schist) or flat structure (structure is a shallowly-dipping thrust) (Pintos Cerda et al., 2020).\n\n\n3.3\nMoodies Group orebodies\nMoodies Group rocks on the overturned southern limb of the Eureka Syncline host a number of quartz-sulphide orebodies, in the mine terminology also referred to as fractures, such as Thomas, Joe\u2019s Luck, Victory Hill, and Golden Vein (Figs. 2,\u00a03c). Many of these orebodies occur at some distance (> 1\u20132\u00a0km) from and without any obvious connection to the central Sheba Fault. Some of the historically mined orebodies have been reopened in recent years and mining targets high-grade quartz-carbonate shoots with gold grades in excess of 100\u00a0g\/t. Gold is mainly mined as free gold with only minor pyrite. In contrast to the mainly fault-controlled, bedding-subparallel reefs (sections 3.1 and 3.2), the majority of orebodies crosscut bedding at high and low angles with steep (> 60-80\u00b0) dips. Similar and seemingly isolated reefs also occur in the Fig Tree Group, such as the Hope Reef complex and the Le Roux reef (Fig. 5a).\nMineralized fractures in the Moodies Group, define three distinct sets within the hinge of the F3b fold (Fig. 6\n), including (1) bedding-parallel, ENE-WSW (N 60\u201370 E) trending reefs, (2) sharply bedding-discordant WNW-ESE (N 55\u201380\u00a0W) striking reefs, and (3) a minor set of NNW (N 20\u00a0W) trending reefs (Fig. 6). The NE-striking quartz reefs such as Tit Bit, Bonanza and King Solomon are roughly parallel to bedding (Fig. 2). In contrast, the WNW- and the smaller set of NNW striking, bedding-discordant structures form a conjugate set of fractures. Notably, the discordant reefs are preferentially developed in the Clutha and Joe\u2019s Luck formations of the Moodies Group and specifically confined within two lithostratigraphic units namely, the Moodies Quartzite (MdQ1) and the Moodies Quartz arenite (MdQ2) (after Anhaeusser, 1976; Figs. 2,\u00a03c). The lithological control on reef formation is particularly well illustrated by the abrupt termination of mineralized fractures in the MdQ2 unit against the over- (MdL2 lava) and underlying (Mdl2 shale) units (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n4\nThomas fracture \u2013 case study of a discordant reef structure\nThe Thomas fracture is a presently mined, crosscutting shear on the southern, overturned limb of the Eureka Syncline (Fig. 2). Historical mining commenced around 1890 with a total production of 1250\u00a0kg of mainly visible gold from a central quartz-vein system with gold grades up to 500\u00a0g\/t (Barberton Mines, internal report, 2016). Currently mined gold grades average 30\u00a0g\/t. Gold mineralization is hosted by an anastomosing, 20\u00a0cm to 2\u00a0m wide quartz-vein system. The central NW-SE striking quartz vein has a strike length of some 60\u00a0m (Fig. 7\na) and its down-dip extent has been established to a depth of over 200\u00a0m from the surface, with steep dips (70-80\u00b0) to the NE. This results in a distinctly blade-like shape of the Thomas fracture. The central quartz vein truncates the ENE-trending overturned bedding at high angles and plunges steeply to the SE, subparallel to the F3b fold hinge that refolds the Ulundi and Eureka synclines (Fig. 7a).\n\n4.1\nWall-rock lithologies\nThomas and its neighbouring fracture, Joe\u2019s Luck, are hosted within the up to 150\u00a0m thick MdQ2 (quartzite) unit of the Joe\u2019s Luck Formation (Fig. 2; Anhaeusser, 1976). In the north, the MdQ2 unit is stratigraphically overlain by a basaltic lava marker horizon (the Moodies Basaltic Lava, MdL2), also part of the Joe\u2019s Luck Formation. In the south, MdQ2 is stratigraphically underlain by fine-grained tuffaceous sandstones and siltstones of the MdS1 unit that forms part of the underlying Clutha Formation (Fig. 2; Anhaeusser, 1976; Heubeck and Lowe, 1994).\nIndividual beds in the MdQ2 unit are massive with thicknesses ranging between 20-30\u00a0cm to a few meters and the beds are light grey in colour (Figs. 7b, c). Cross-bedding (Figs. 7b, c) and graded bedding are common and clearly illustrate the overturned nature of bedding in this part of the Eureka Syncline. The rocks comprise rounded to subrounded monocrystalline quartz (75\u201385 %) and lesser amounts (15\u201325 %) of plagioclase, microcline, and lithic clasts (mainly chert), all set in a finer-grained sericite-quartz matrix (Figs. 8\na, b). Thus, the MdQ2 units around the Thomas fracture are better described as subarkosic in composition, given the high modal percentage of feldspar (Folk et al., 1970). Clasts of quartz and feldspar have an average size of 250\u00a0\u00b5m but can be as large as 500\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig. 8a). Plagioclase is, in places, partly saussuritized, but K-feldspar is remarkably fresh, with or without the characteristic cross-hatch twinning (Fig. 8b). The mineral make-up of the interstitial quartz-sericite dominated matrix (mineral lengths of 2\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m) agrees with the regional lower-greenschist facies grades of metamorphism (e.g., Heubeck and Lowe, 1999). The lack of alteration features suggests that the MdQ2 wall-rocks around Thomas have not experienced significant or pervasive hydrothermal alteration. A carbonate-sericite alteration is evident by a greenish-yellow tinge only within ca. 50\u00a0cm of the central vein at Thomas.\n\n\n4.2\nStructure of the main central shear and associated veins\nThe Thomas fracture is developed as a massive to anastomosing sheeted quartz vein. The vein quartz is dark grey or black and overprinted by thin (< 1 mm to 2\u00a0cm), vein-parallel, gently undulating, white to light-grey cataclasite bands characterized by the grainsize reduction of vein quartz (Figs. 9\na, b). Contacts between wall-rock and vein quartz are sharp, but locally marked by a sigmoidal drag of the bedding on either side of the central vein (Fig. 9a). Thickness variations of the central vein occur along undulations and, in places, the branching of the central vein may enclose meter-scale, lensoid slivers of Moodies Group wall-rock. In addition to the vein-parallel cataclasite bands (see below), the brittle nature of the central vein is also indicated by the presence of narrow (< 1\u20135\u00a0mm), mainly low-angle shears and fractures that crosscut the central vein and wall-rocks (Fig. 9b). Based on their orientation and angular relationships, these fractures correspond to synthetic Riedel (R1) shears that displace bedding-parallel veins with a dextral sense of shear (Fig. 9b) (note: all kinematics are given in map view and looking down-dip, when most photos and sketches of underground exposures are of the roof of the development, looking up-dip).\n\nWithin the veins, quartz exhibits undulose extinction, irregular grain boundaries, and subgrain formation, all indicative of dynamic recrystallization processes (Fig. 9c). Quartz shows vastly different grainsizes ranging between 1 and 350\u00a0\u00b5m. The large quartz grains (60\u2013350\u00a0\u00b5m) are part of vein quartz that formed parallel to the central vein (e.g., Fig. 9d). Much finer grain sizes (1\u201320\u00a0\u00b5m) relate to the brecciation, reworking and cataclastic overprint of earlier formed quartz veins that now occur as mm- to cm-sized fragments in the finer-grained cataclasites (Figs. 9c, e).\nBoth coarse quartz veins and cataclasites are overprinted by a further generation of cataclasite bands (Fig. 9c). These later-generation cataclasites contain fragments of both earlier cataclasites and coarser vein quartz and are associated with a sericitic alteration along crosscutting slip horizons (Figs. 9c, e). Cataclastic textures are characterized by the fragmentation and grain-size reduction of earlier, coarse-grained quartz veins to very fine grain sizes\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00b5m. The deformation textures also indicate repeated episodes of brittle cataclastic deformation overprinted by and alternating with episodes of dynamic recrystallization. Ductile processes are evidenced by the presence of sutured quartz-grain boundaries, polygonal textures of quartz grains, undulose extinction, and subgrain boundary migration processes also resulting in the coarsening of the fine-grained cataclasites (Fig. 9c). Sericite in the associated alteration displays a preferred orientation and a weak foliation, parallel to the central vein and, in places, S-C fabrics (Fig. 9c).\nGold grades along the strike of the central vein are very erratic. Gold specks observed in hand specimen are large, cm-sized, and are situated within the black quartz vein (Fig. 9d). Microscopically, mm-sized specks of free gold are present either within the coarser vein quartz or within the fine-grained quartz of cataclasite bands (Figs. 9e, f).\nThe drag of bedding into the central vein, sigmoidal deflection of bedding in lensoid wall-rock slivers, and the orientation and shear sense of synthetic Riedel shears indicate a dextral component of shear along the central vein at Thomas in the horizontal (Figs. 9a, b, 10\na). Steep down-dip lineations on quartz slickensides, in turn, suggest an additional dip-slip component of displacement. Widely-spaced S-C shear bands in vertical sections along the lateral termination of the central vein confirm a top-to-the-SW dip-slip component (Fig. 10b). As such, the Thomas fracture is not an extensional vein (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1976) but is emplaced into a steeply dipping, oblique reverse shear developed in the massively bedded MdQ2 unit in the inner arc of the Eureka Syncline.\n\n\n\n5\nControls of regional fluid flow \u2013 the role of bedding planes\nWhile gold mineralization and quartz veining testify to the focussing of large amounts of fluids along the Thomas fracture, wall-rocks outside the mineralized vein system appear remarkably unaltered. However, bedding planes of the MdQ2 subarkose around Thomas contain both quartz veins (Fig. 9b) and hydrothermal alteration assemblages (Fig. 11\n) that suggest a more confined and bedding-parallel regional fluid flow. The hydrothermal assemblage comprises sericite, chlorite, muscovite, pyrite and minor carbonate. The commonly dark colouration of bedding planes (Fig. 7c) relate to the concentration of original detrital rounded minerals, such as zircon, chromite, rutile, and pyrite (Fig. 11). Hydrothermal alteration along bedding planes is, in contrast, evidenced by newly grown chlorite, muscovite, and minor calcite (Fig. 11). A second-generation pyrite on bedding planes is morphologically distinct from the rounded detrital pyrite grains and commonly intricately intergrown with chlorite and\/or muscovite (Fig. 11a). Sericite and chlorite occur as intricately intergrown elongate blades or books with a length of up to 200\u00a0\u00b5m. Coarser sericite blades can be seen to be rimming and replacing feldspar (both microcline and plagioclase) and sericite also occurs within cracks of pyrite and microcline. The abundance of muscovite, chlorite and sulphides increase drastically, from the interior of individual beds towards bedding planes, with sharp contacts (Figs. 11b, d). On bedding planes, the hydrothermal alteration assemblages constitute over 50 % of the original rock, with relic pyrite, heavy minerals (zircon, rutile) and relics of quartz and microcline (Fig. 11). Zones of bedding-parallel alteration in the MdQ2 unit are narrow and typically less than 1\u00a0cm wide.\nOn a regional-scale, bedding-parallel quartz and quartz-carbonate veins are a far more obvious manifestation of this bedding-parallel fluid flow. These veins are ubiquitous in the mine workings in both the Fig Tree and, to a lesser extent, the Moodies Group. Bedding-parallel quartz and quartz-carbonate veins range from a few millimeters to tens of centimeters in thickness. Quartz veins are typically dark-grey to black (Fig. 12\na), a characteristic feature of quartz veins in the Barberton mines, and they can appear texturally massive, or zoned. Zoned veins are syntaxial veins with cm-size, blade-like carbonates along vein walls and black quartz in the centre of the veins (see also Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018). Laminated quartz vein textures, as they are recorded from the metasediments of the Bendigo goldfields in southeast Australia (e.g., Fowler, 1996; Fowler and Winsor, 1997), are rare.\nQuartz veins may occur closely spaced and in clusters, particularly along shale-greywacke contacts, or as isolated veins and veinlets. In the Fig Tree Group, veins are typically surrounded by a greenish sericite-chlorite-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite alteration halo. Veins may be parallel-sided and planar or they may display pinch-and-swell and boudinaged structures. In places, veins are developed as trains of en \u00e9chelon veins with thicknesses from 0.5\u00a0cm to a few centimeters. Quartz-carbonate veins show a much closer spacing (0.1\u20131\u00a0m) in the interbedded greywacke-shale Fig Tree Group (Fig. 12a), whereas in the Moodies subarkose (MdQ2), veins are infrequent and the spacing between veins can be as great as tens of meters. In prominent shale units of the Fig Tree Group, bedding-parallel fluid flow is evidenced by commonly thinner (1\u20133\u00a0mm) quartz veinlets, but locally abundant hydrothermal sulphides, mainly pyrite (Figs. 12b, c). Pyrite forms elongate, bedding- and foliation-parallel stringers and aggregates and fine-grained clusters (Figs. 12b, c). In contrast, quartz veins in greywacke units interbedded with shale commonly crosscut bedding.\nBlack quartz veins with a distinctly step-like appearance are common in the Fig Tree Group rocks at Fairview Mine (Fig. 12d; see also Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018). The veins consist of short (20\u2013200\u00a0cm), bedding-parallel segments that connect with high-angle bedding-normal vein segments, resulting in the characteristic step-like geometry (Fig. 12d). The crosscutting segments can extend for several meters into the wall-rocks, beyond the area of underground developments. Notably, bedding-normal veins tend to widen where they link with bedding-parallel veins. This also suggests that veining occurred during bedding-parallel slip. In places, narrow, bedding-parallel veinlets form spurs that extend beyond the right-angle step into bedding-normal veins.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nRegional considerations\nMost workers agree on the late introduction of gold mineralization relative to the tectonometamorphic events in the BGB, but the absolute timing of the mineralizing event has not been resolved (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1976; de Ronde et al., 1991, 1992; Robertson et al., 1994; Otto et al., 2007; Dirks et al., 2009, 2013; Dziggel et al., 2010; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018, 2019). Previous age constraints point to an age range of between 3126\u00a0Ma (de Ronde et al., 1991) to 3015\u00a0Ma (Dirks et al., 2013) for the mineralization, some 150\u2013200\u00a0m.y. after the main tectonism (D2) that occurred between 3230 and 3225\u00a0Ma (e.g., de Ronde and de Wit, 1994). The low-salinity fluids in the Barberton mines (de Ronde et al., 1992) are typical for orogenic lode-gold deposits where fluid generation is, in most cases, related to metamorphic devolatilization reactions of meta-volcanosedimentary sequences at depth (e.g., Phillips and Powell, 2010). However, neither the source rocks nor the thermal event that may have generated the mineralizing fluids can be constrained with any certainty. Given the highly variable orebody geometries and stratigraphic positions, the controls of the mineralization have also remained ambiguous. de Ronde et al. (1991, 1992) suggest fluid infiltration along reactivated, earlier thrusts and shear zones and associated second-order structures (see also Robertson et al., 1994; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017), while Dirks et al. (2009, 2013) postulate mineralization during late-stage extensional tectonics. Agangi et al. (2016) provided evidence for a meteoritic component of mineralizing fluid that questioned a deeper-crustal fluid source. Recent studies relate mineralization and fluid flow to the refolding (F3b) of the Eureka and Ulundi synclines (Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018, 2019; Pintos Cerda et al., 2020), similar to the earlier suggestions by Anhaeusser (1976). This highlights the many uncertainties around the origin and timing of gold mineralization in the SFC and that there is no single model that can be applied.\nIrrespective of the absolute timing and fluid sources, high-grade gold mineralization in reefs of the Barberton mines document regionally high fluid volumes that were channelled into a variety of different structures with varying controls, orientations, geometries, stratigraphic position, and wall-rocks. A prerequisite for this channelized fluid flow is the connectivity and linkage between regional fluid systems and the more localized, high-permeability pathways. It is before this background that we discuss the regional and local controls of fluid flow in the SFC.\n\n\n6.2\nControls and relative timing of regional fluid flow\nSome 85 % of the presently and historically mined reefs in the SFC occur in the hinge region of the refolded (F3b) Ulundi and Eureka synclines (Fig. 2). Moreover, the SE plunge of the MRC, MRT and ZK ore shoots, but also smaller reefs, such as the Thomas fracture, are parallel to the F3b hinge while the reef structures throughout the SFC seem largely unaffected by this refolding. These features point to the regional controls of fluid flow and mineralization during the refolding of the Eureka and Ulundi synclines.\nFluid migration and fluid-rock interactions during folding are well documented features, from fracture networks controlling hydrocarbon migration in folds at shallow crustal levels (e.g., Oliver, 1986; Casey and Butler, 2004; Robb, 2005; Selley and Sonnenberg, 2015) to hydrothermal vein systems in folds that have formed in mid-crustal terrains and under metamorphic conditions (e.g., Hodgson, 1989; Cox et al., 1987, 1991; Groves et al., 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Willman, 2007). Fluid redistribution and lateral fluid flow in folds follow changes in hydraulic heads from areas of high mean rock stress, typically fold limbs, towards the fold hinge region as an area of reduced mean rock stress (Hodgson, 1989; Oliver et al., 1990; Ridley, 1993; Groves et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2007; Evans and Fischer, 2012). This regional fluid distribution during folding may account for the concentration of reefs in the refolded F3b hinge zone of the synclines, with only few gold showings outside the SFC (Figs. 2, 3, 13\n).\nThe well-preserved bedding and mechanical layering of the Fig Tree and Moodies groups are likely to have promoted flexural-slip folding in the Ulundi and Eureka synclines. Flexural-slip folding is particularly pronounced in the shale-greywacke sequence of the Fig Tree Group in which the weaker shale layers localize strain and act as discrete low-displacement slip surfaces. The synkinematic, ubiquitous bedding-parallel veins (Figs. 9b, 12) and alteration (Fig. 11) testify to the fact that bedding planes acted as fluid conduits during flexural slip (Fig. 13). This fluid flow along bedding planes provides the means for large-scale fluid infiltration of the sequence when much of the wall-rocks show only a few signs of minor alteration. The stepped quartz-veins (Fig. 12d) that are developed throughout the mine workings are important as they accommodate lateral fluid flow, parallel to bedding, as well as fluid flow across the stratigraphy. The stepped veins also indicate vein formation under close-to-lithostatic fluid pressures, where the difference in tensile strength parallel and across bedding planes was similar to the differential stress so that vein propagation either along or across the bedding was promoted (Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018). These features underline the significance of (1) the preservation of well-bedded Moodies and Fig Tree groups in the Eureka and Ulundi synclines that have (2) experienced late-stage, high-angle refolding and associated flexural slip, unlike other synclinal structures in the greenstone belt, for regional fluid flow. The combination of these factors is a prerequisite for the mineralization and accounts for the unique position of the SFC along the northwestern margin of the BGB.\n\n\n6.3\nControls of focussed fluid flow and orebodies in the SFC\n\n6.3.1\nMain ore shoots\nWhile bedding-parallel quartz-veining and alteration in the metasedimentary units delineate the pathways of regional extensive fluid infiltration, economic-grade reefs correspond to fluid sinks where the regional fluid flow was channelled (Fig. 13). The localization of the large MRT, MRC and ZK ore shoots along the contacts between ultramafic rocks of the Weltevreden Formation and Fig Tree Group metasediments (e.g., Wagener and Wiegand, 1986; Fig. 5c), emphasizes the role of rheological contrasts and lithological boundaries for fluid flow (e.g., Ord and Oliver, 1997). In effect, strain localization and increased slip rates along the contact between rheologically weaker ultramafic rocks against the overlying, more competent chert and Fig Tree Group greywackes render the contacts low-displacement shear zones. The juxtaposition of units with strongly contrasting rigidity promotes brittle fracturing and fluid flow in the more competent lithologies. Undulations and jog geometries along the sheared contacts provide additional dilatancy and hydrologic gradients. This leads to further fluid focussing and the formation of extensive ore shoots such as that of the MRC (Fig. 5a). The oblique-slip kinematics and the SE plunge of the ore shoots, parallel to the first-order fold, underline deformation as a result of flexural slip associated with the refolding of the regional synclines (Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2019). Importantly, the main shoots do not follow the central hinge axis (F3b), but are rather located several hundred meters to the southwest (MRT and MRC at Fairview Mine) and east (ZK shoot at Sheba Mine) of the first-order hinge, respectively (Fig. 2). This may reflect the gradual decrease of flexural-slip deformation from the limbs of the folds, where it is at a maximum, towards the actual hinge-point of folds, where there is no flexural slip (e.g., Ramsay, 1967). Ore shoots located just off the central hinge line record the combination of (1) hinge-directed fluid flow, and (2) flexural-slip deformation that provides dilation and hydrologic gradients.\nThe structural position of the large MRT, MRC and ZK ore shoots (Fig. 5c) at a distance from the F3b hinge of the Ulundi Syncline is, in many ways, similar to the well-documented saddle reef structures of the Bendigo goldfields in Victoria (e.g., Schaubs and Wilson, 2002; Willman, 2007). Here, fluid flow was channelled along dilatant zones provided by strain incompatibilities that arose during folding of the metasedimentary rocks in the anticlinal hinges. Along strike, saddle reefs show a remarkable continuity for several kilometers that document the hinge-parallel channelling of fluids in individual folds (e.g., Sibson, 2005). While the structural controls and positioning of the Barberton ore shoots are different to those of the Bendigo saddle reefs (where the main ore shoots are related to limb thrusts that truncate anticlinal hinges; e.g., Willman, 2007), down-plunge extents of up to 2\u00a0km of the Barberton shoots record a similar hinge-parallel permeability structure (Fig. 5c).\nThe localization of the Bendigo saddle reefs in the more or less upright anticlines also reflects the buoyancy-driven, upward directed component of fluid flow, fed by bedding-parallel veins along fold limbs, and its control by upward-closing impermeable layers in the anticlines (e.g., Schaubs and Wilson, 2002; Willman, 2007). The difference in fold geometries \u2013 gently doubly-plunging anticlines in the Bendigo goldfields versus steeply plunging synclinal structures in Barberton \u2013 is probably the main distinguishing feature between the two gold districts. In the Barberton synclines, the combined bedding-parallel and cross-stratigraphy, buoyancy-driven upward fluid flow would have been unrestricted compared to the anticlines in Bendigo. This permits the migration and escape of fluids to higher structural levels. In the SFC, this may have provided fluids to higher levels in the upper parts of the Fig Tree stratigraphy and, thus, account for the structurally higher and seemingly isolated hanging wall reefs situated above the main ore shoots (Fig. 5a; e.g., Hope, Le Roux, and Commitment reefs, see 6.3.3 below).\n\n\n6.3.2\nSheba Fault mineralization\nOutside the main ore shoots along the Weltevreden Formation anticlines, the Sheba Fault is the central, first-order fault in the SFC that has been explored to a depth of almost 2\u00a0km and displaying consistently steep dips (55-65\u00b0) at surface. As such, the Sheba Fault may well serve as a fluid conduit that links a deeper-seated fluid reservoir with the present levels of mineralization (Fig. 13). The fault also cuts through the stratigraphy and, as such, truncates bedding planes and bedding fluid conduits in both the Moodies and Fig Tree groups (Fig. 2). While pervasive carbonate-sericite-chlorite alteration is recorded along much of the strike extent of the refolded arcuate fault, economic-grade mineralization is again concentrated in the vicinity of F3b hinge of the F3a first-order Ulundi and Eureka folds (Figs. 2,\u00a03a). Outside of the central hinge region, east of the Sheba Mine, mineralization drastically decreases with only a few orebodies present such as Royal Sheba and Great She (Fig. 2). The concentration of orebodies in the strongly curved part of the fault suggests that the main phase of fluid flow and mineralization were related to the late-stage refolding of the fault rather than earlier episodes of thrusting that juxtaposed the Fig Tree Group against the underlying Moodies Group. This corresponds to the largely undeformed vein networks in the footwall damage zone of the fault that have not experienced any significant overprint that would be expected during either progressive or repeated deformation. Fluid channelling may, therefore, record a significant component of lateral fluid flow along the fault, from the fold limbs to the hinge region, and through the truncation and tapping of localized (bedding-parallel) fluid channels (Fig. 13).\n\n\n6.3.3\nMoodies Group mineralization\nBedding-discordant reef structures, such as Thomas, Joe\u2019s Luck, or Victory Hill in the Moodies Group (Figs. 2, 3) and the Hope and Le Roux reefs in the Fig Tree Group (Fig. 5a) crosscut bedding at high angles. These structures, either with steep or shallow dips, are ideally orientated for the collection and channelling of fluid from the regional pattern of bedding-parallel fluid flow (Fig. 14\n). The orientation and kinematics of the reef structures, but also the occurrence of reefs confined to lithological units, suggest both a structural and lithological control on their formation.\nShallowly-dipping reefs such as the Hope Reef in the deeper levels of the Fairview Mine (Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018) or the flat structure at Sheba Mine (Pintos Cerda et al., 2020) represent low-angle thrusts. The SE dips of the structures, irrespective of their location in the SFC, and top-to-the-NW kinematics record the late-stage NW-SE subhorizontal shortening of the Ulundi Syncline (see also Robertson et al., 1994). The reefs are confined to competent lithologies, either greywacke-dominated sections of the Fig Tree Group (Hope Reef), or the green fuchsite-quartz schist at Sheba Mine (flat structure), and the reefs terminate abruptly along contacts with less competent shale or talc-carbonate schist units, respectively. This again emphasizes the lithological control for the formation of brittle fracture (vein) networks and permeability in the layered sequences (Schouwstra, 1995; Pearton and Viljoen, 2017; Gloyn-Jones and Kisters, 2018; Pintos Cerda et al., 2020).\nThe occurrence of the mainly steep reefs in the MdQ2 unit of the Moodies Group suggests a very similar lithological control of quartz reefs by competent units with relatively low tensile strengths compared to the under- and overlying units. Kinematic indicators point to an origin of the Thomas mineralization as an oblique slip, high-angle dextral reverse shear fracture forming under NW-SE directed subhorizontal shortening (Fig. 10). Overprinting relationships between brittle features (cataclasite bands, brecciation, quartz veining) and dynamic recrystallization textures in the central vein (Fig. 9), document repeated episodes of brittle fracturing and dilatancy alternating with the sealing of permeabilities as prerequisites for fault-valve action. Fracture dilatancy and fluid pressure drops during fault slip are followed by mineral precipitation whereby the gold-sulphide complexes in solution are destabilized. This is followed by dynamic recrystallization during interseismic fault creep that allows for the renewed build-up of fluid pressures to lithostatic values for further slip to occur (e.g., Sibson, 1996, 2001, 2020; Cox, 2005). The steep dip (\u223c76\u00b0) and oblique reverse slip along Thomas renders the reef ideally orientated for fault-valving (e.g., Sibson et al., 1988; Sibson and Scott, 1998). Fault-valve action and resulting fluid pressure cycling is also consistent with the occurrence of mainly free gold in the reefs, since the siliceous Moodies quartzites and arkoses are chemically relatively inert to allow for other precipitation processes (e.g., Mikucki, 1998).\nThe WNW- and NNW-trending (Fig. 6) mineralized fractures have not been affected by the late-stage refolding (F3b) and emphasize the relatively late timing of the fracture formation. Angular relationships between the two sets suggest they form part of a conjugate shear-fracture system. Provided that both sets were active at the same time, the orientations would indicate the formation of the conjugate fractures during NW-SE directed subhorizontal shortening. The oblique dextral sense of shear along the Thomas fracture is consistent with this direction of regional shortening, but we have not been able to confirm the kinematics along the NNW-trending set. Provided the fractures form part of conjugate fracture sets, their orientation corresponds to accommodation structures that form in the inner arcs of folds undergoing contraction during folding. Notably, unmineralized quartz veins form radiating extension fractures and are situated along the outer arc of the F3b fold, suggesting formation during the refolding of the two synclines (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1976; Viljoen, 1982).\n\n\n\n6.4\nRegional deformation and strains\nRegional F3 folds in the interior of the BGB are commonly tight synclines and, to a lesser extent, anticlines that are juxtaposed against steep reverse faults (e.g., Lowe et al., 1999). The marginal zones of the greenstone belt against the structurally underlying TTG basement are complicated by the refolding of greenstone lithologies around the commonly rounded, dome-like outlines (in plan view) of the TTG plutons (e.g., Anhaeusser, 1981; Lowe and Byerly, 2007; Kisters et al., 2003; van Kranendonk, 2011). In numerous Archaean greenstone belts, this interference between greenstones and TTGs results in the formation of triangular, funnel-shaped areas (\u2018cleavage triple points\u2019 \u2013 after Gorman et al., 1978; Brun et al., 1981). Cleavage triple points are characterized by more or less conformable contacts of greenstones against the bordering TTGs, inward dips of greenstones defining the steeply plunging or subvertical funnel-shaped structure, and off-the-dome kinematics, radial lineation patterns and associated strongly constrictional strains. These features have been interpreted to indicate the sinking and infolding of denser and cooler greenstone lithologies against hotter, partially molten and buoyantly rising felsic TTG crust, forming the basis of models of convective crustal overturn and vertical tectonics on a presumably hotter Archaean Earth (e.g., Dixon, 1975; Mareschal and West, 1980; Anhaeusser, 1981; Bouhallier et al., 1993; Collins et al., 1998; van Kranendonk, 2011; van Kranendonk et al., 2014, to name but a few).\nThe refolded Eureka and Ulundi synclines between the Kaap Valley Tonalite and Nelspruit Batholith may, in plan view, resemble such a cleavage triple point, but the structural inventory, local and regional strains, and the timing of magmatism cannot be reconciled with an origin of the refolding during the buoyant rise of the surrounding TTGs and granites. The folds comprise steep to overturned SE limbs and normal NW limbs, which results in the pronounced NW vergence of the folds. The folds do not define an inward-dipping funnel structure, lineation patterns are unidirectional to the SE, not radial, and constrictional strains are not developed. In fact, the two synclines, separated by the Sheba Fault, and bound by the Lily Fault in the west and the Barbrook Fault in the east, form part of the regional, NW-verging fold-and-thrust belt-like geometry that is also described from the interior of the belt (e.g., Heubeck and Lowe, 1999; Lowe et al., 1999; Drabon et al., 2019). The main difference between the two synclines along the margin compared to those in the interior of the belt is the pronounced bending or arcuation (F3b refolding) of the originally NE-SW trending folds (Fig. 15\n). Late-stage deformation and mineralization of reefs in the SFC record NW-SE shortening strains and associated NW-directed transport. These features suggest that the refolding of the fold axial planes of the two synclines occurred during progressive or renewed NW-SE shortening. The refolding reflects the adjustment of the Eureka and Ulundi synclines to changes of the structural footwall along the margin of the belt, similar to salients and oroclines of fold-and-thrust belts (e.g., Marshak, 1988, 2004; Weil and Sussman, 2004; Johnston et al., 2013). In this scenario, the Kaap Valley Tonalite in the NW and the Nelspruit Batholith or Stentor Pluton in the NE have acted as competent buttresses (Fig. 15). The rheologically weaker serpentinite and talc-carbonate schist units of the Jamestown Schist Belt, in turn, formed a detachment unit at the base of the synclines (Ramsay, 1963, Figure 25 within). This agrees with the NW- to NE vergence of shear folds in serpentinites at the base of the Eureka Syncline (Ramsay, 1963). This structural inventory suggests the refolding of the synclines in this part of the BGB is to be the result of fold bending (shortening at high-angles to layering) rather than buckling (shortening parallel to original layering).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from the present study:\n\n1.\nThe concentration of over 85 % of presently and historically mined orebodies in the SFC located in the refolded hinge (F3b) of the Eureka and Ulundi synclines suggests that the regional fluid flow occurred from the fold limbs to the hinge of the synclines, following hydraulic gradients during late-stage folding.\n\n\n2.\nUbiquitous bedding-parallel quartz veins, alteration, and sulphide mineralization in the well-bedded metasedimentary rocks of the Fig Tree and Moodies groups, indicate that the regional fluid flow was mainly controlled by bedding anisotropies. The bedding planes acted as low-displacement slip surfaces during flexural-slip deformation related to the late-stage refolding of the synclines.\n\n\n3.\nEconomic-grade mineralization occurs along a variety of structures that tapped and channelled the regional fluid flow. Lithological and resulting rheological contrasts between rock types in the metasedimentary sequence exert a most important control on fluid focussing. Lithological contacts result in strain localization during flexural-slip folding that promotes the formation of brittle fracture (vein) networks and permeability in competent units across contacts. This includes large, hinge-parallel ore shoots confined to sheared contacts between retrogressed ultramafic rocks and Fig Tree metasediments along with orebodies in the damage zone of the central Sheba Fault.\n\n\n4.\nSmall-scale, bedding-discordant reefs in competent arkosic units of the Moodies Group emphasize the lithological control by units that possess low tensile strengths. The bedding-discordant high-angle reverse faults and thrusts relate to the late-stage tightening of the first-order folds and their discordant geometry renders them optimally orientated to tap into and channel the regional bedding-parallel fluid flow.\n\n\n5.\nThe refolding of the synclines in the northwestern portion of the belt was by means of bending during either continued or renewed NW-SE shortening, juxtaposing the synclines against the competent plutons much like the formation of a salient or an orocline. The late-stage, syn-mineralization NW-SE shortening strains are recorded throughout the mine workings, emphasizing the significance of regional strains for the development of localized structures and mineralization.\n\n\n\n\n","38":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nLow-temperature thermochronology including fission track and (U-Th)\/He is broadly applied to reveal upper crustal process including timing and duration of mineralization process, rate of exhumation and erosion of intrusive ore deposits and comparative preservation potential because of their lower closure temperatures (McInnes et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2019a,b; 2020; Zhao et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2013; Bineli et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017a,b; Braxton et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2008; Leng et al., 2018). The apatite (U-Th)\/He system with the lowest closure temperature of 45\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C (Farley et al., 1998; Wolf et al., 1998) has the potential to place temporal constraints on exhumation processes from 1- to 3-km depth to the surface under a geothermal gradient of 20 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Leng et al., 2018). When thermochronometers are combined with geochronometers (e.g., zircon U\/Pb, biotite 40Ar\/39Ar), over 800\u00a0\u00b0C of magmatic-hydrothermal history of a deposit is revealed from emplacement to erosion (Wolf et al. 1998; Farley et al. 1998; McInnes et al. 1999; Chiaradia et al. 2013; McInnes et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2020).\nThe Duolong ore district, the biggest ore district in western Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt of Tibet Plateau, is characterized by several Early Cretaceous porphyry-epithermal deposits (\u223c120\u00a0Ma) including Naruo, Tiegelongnan, and Duobuza. The Duolong ore district contains a resource of\u00a0\u223c\u00a020 million metric tons of copper (Tang et al., 2016, Li et al., 2013a,b; Lin et al., 2016, Lin et al., 2018). Intense uplift events of the Tibetan plateau (Murphy et al., 1997; Zheng et al., 2000; Roger et al., 2000; Tapponnier et al., 2001\uff1bKapp et al., 2005, 2007; Yuan et al., 2006a; Wang et al., 2008; Rohrmann et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013; Hetzel et al., 2011) which resulted in crustal thickening and surface uplift have an important impact on the exhumation and preservation of deposits in it (Zhao et al., 2015, 2016; Zhou et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2017). With the advent of (U-Th)\/He and fission track methods which could record the thermal history of rock samples between 70 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Reiners et al., 2004; Farley et al., 1998; Wolf et al. 1998), the low-temperature thermal study is an effective way to investigate the exhumation and preservation mechanism of porphyry-epithermal system in the Duolong ore district of the Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt.\nRecent contributions of thermochronological studies on the Duolong ore district have investigated post-mineralization exhumation history of the Tiegelongnan deposit and improved the understanding of uplift history of central Tibetan Plateau (Yang et al., 2019a,b, 2020). However, the preservation mechanism of the porphyry-epithermal system and the effect of faults on the mineralization in the Duolong ore district have not been determined yet. In order to address the above questions, the new apatite and zircon fission track and (U-Th)\/He ages along with previous low-temperature thermochronological data are presented in this paper to investigate the exhumation and preservation histories of the Tiegelongnan, Naruo and Duobuza deposits in the Duolong ore district. In a combination with regional geological and paleoclimate data, our results show that the faults related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision have an important role in the deposit preservation, the preservation of porphyry-epithermal system in the Duolong ore district mainly benefited from the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. The results of this study is of great help to evaluate ore preservation potential for the Early Cretaceous porphyry-epithermal deposits in the Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt in central Tibet Plateau.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt, a\u00a0>\u00a01200\u00a0km-long belt of mainly Jurassic-Cretaceous flysch, m\u00e9lange, and ophiolitic fragments, is composed of the Bangongco-Nujiang suture zone, south edge of the west Qiangtang terrane, and north edge of the north Lhasa terrane (Fig. 1\na, Song et al., 2018; Geng et al., 2011; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Shi et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2012). The Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt has become another important copper belt in Tibet together with the Yulong and Gangdise metallogenic belts because of its metallogenic potential (Tang et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2016).\nMultiple stages of exhumation occurred in the Qiangtang terrane including early exhumation of the central Qiangtang terrane from the Early Cretaceous to early Late Cretaceous, intense exhumation of the whole Qiangtang terrane from the Late Cretaceous to Oligocene, as well as exhumation of local areas in the edge of the Qiangtang terrane since the Oligocene (Yang et al., 2020). During Early Cretaceous time, the Lhasa terrane was underthrust a significant distance northward beneath the Qiangtang terrane along the Bangongco-Nujiang suture zone, following closure of the Bangong ocean, causing an elevated and relatively low-relief plateau in central Tibet (Kapp et al., 2005, Kapp et al., 2007). Major Early Cretaceous deformation and exhumation have also been documented along strike to the west and east in the Gaize and Amdo areas, respectively, as well as in the Qiangtang terrane to north (Kapp et al., 2005; Guynn et al., 2006). The collision between the Indian and Eurasian continents, beginning at around 65\u00a0Ma (Jaeger et al., 1989; Rowley, 1996), and ending with the \u201chard collision\u201d at around 40\u00a0Ma (Liu et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2005) also caused the crustal shortening and thickening of the Tibetan Plateau. The underthrusting of the greater Indian lithosphere as far as the Qiangtang terrane caused uplift and exhumation as evidenced by the molasses from the Qiangtang terrane (Ren et al., 2016; Kapp et al., 2005), teleseismic P-wave tomography of southern Ganges plain in India and Tibet Plateau (Zheng et al., 2007; He et al., 2010) and studies of the magnetostratigraphy, sedimentology, paleocurrent measurements, chronology of central plateau (Wang et al., 2008).\nThe Duolong ore district lies in the southern part of the western Qiangtang terrane (Fig. 1b) and ore-forming magmas are related to northward subduction of the Bangongco-Nujiang ocean beneath the Qiangtang terrane prior to Indian Plate collision with Asia (Li, 2008; Lin et al., 2019). A Precambrian to early Paleozoic Gondwanan continental basement in the Duolong ore district is covered by Middle to Late Ordovician to Cenozoic sediments (Zhao et al., 2014). Outcropping strata mainly consist of the Upper Triassic Riganpeicuo Formation limestone; Middle-Lower Jurassic Sewa Formation siltstone and sandstone; Lower Cretaceous Meiriqiecuo Formation andesite, dacite, trachyandesite and basaltic andesite; Upper Cretaceous Abushan Formation conglomerate; and Quaternary alluvial sediments (Fig. 2\n). Regional tectonism in the Duolong region includes a series of northeast-southwest, northwest-southeast and east\u2013west striking faults. However, the formation time and displacement of faults have not been determined because of the strong coverage of Quaternary alluvial sediments. Permian and Early Cretaceous igneous rocks in the Duolong ore district mainly include basalt, gabbro, granodiorite porphyry, diorite porphyry and granite porphyry (Fig. 3\n). Permian basalt with chlorite and carbonate alterations and Early Cretaceous granite porphyry with phyllic and argillic alterations mainly distributed in southeast of the Duolong ore district. Gabbro with chlorite and argillic alterations was intruded in the Jurassic stratigraphy. Diorite porphyry characterized by phyllic alteration occurs in the Dibao area (Lin et al., 2016). Granodiorite porphyry and diorite porphyry are the main ore-related intrusive rocks at the Duolong ore district. Granodiorite porphyry, diorite porphyry, granite porphyry, and gabbro were parts of the 120\u00a0Ma plutons. Late Cretaceous (\u223c110\u00a0Ma) basaltic andesite and andesite unconformably overlay the 120\u00a0Ma intrusions and older strata (Fig. 3).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\n\n3.1\nNaruo deposit geology\nThe Naruo deposit located in the northern of the Duolong ore district is porphyry copper deposit (Fig. 3). The deposit is mainly hosted by the Lower Jurassic Sewa Formation felspathic quartz sandstone and granodiorite porphyry which is ore-related intrusive rock (Ding, 2014; Lin et al., 2018). The granodiorite porphyry locally crops out in the field because of strongly cover of Quaternary sediments. Northeast-southwest striking fault developed through the Naruo deposit. The diorite porphyry was also revealed by the drill cores in the Naruo deposit. Rocks are extensively altered by biotite and\/or quartz (potassic alteration) and chlorite, epidote, carbonate (propylitic alteration) in the deep crust and kaolinite (weak argillic alteration) near surface (Lin et al., 2018). The potassic alteration is mainly associated with disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite, and a certain amount of chalcopyrite were revealed in chlorite and epidote altered intrusive rocks (Ding et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018). Existing zircon U-Pb age data in the Naruo suggest intrusive rocks concentrated at 124\u00a0\u223c\u00a0115\u00a0Ma (Sun et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2015a,b; Ding et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2015). The molybdenite Re-Os age is about 119\u00a0Ma (Sun et al., 2016) indicating the early stage of intrusions (\u223c120\u00a0Ma) is related to mineralization.\n\n\n3.2\nTiegelongnan deposit geology\nThe Tiegelongnan porphyry-epithermal deposit has a resource of\u00a0\u223c\u00a010 million tonnes of copper. It is located in the northern part of the Duolong ore district where the siltstone and sandstone host rocks of the Late Jurassic Sewa Formation were intruded by Early Cretaceous diorite and granodiorite porphyries that are closely associated with copper\u2013gold ores (Fig. 3). The ore-related rocks are unconformably overlain by post-ore series of andesite and basaltic andesite lavas, breccias and volcaniclastic rocks of Lower Cretaceous Meiriqiecuo Formation. The mineralized intrusions intrude at depth of 1.4\u00a0km (Yang et al., 2014).\nPotassic alteration (biotite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz) associated with disseminated chalcopyrite mainly developed in the granodiorite porphyry. Phyllic or serictic alteration (sericite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz) developed in all host rock in the periphery of the potassic alteration is associated with chalcopyrite, bornite, and covellite. Advanced argillic alteration (kaolinite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0dickite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz) associated with digenite, covellite, enargite, and tennantite mainly developed in the center and upper parts of the deposit (Lin et al., 2016). Propylitic alteration (chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0epidote\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz) developed in southern part of the deposit. The existing age data from the Tiegelongnan deposit include U-Pb zircon ages for the diorite and granodiorite porphyries ranging from 123.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 to 115.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma (Tang et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020).\n\n\n3.3\nDuobuza deposit geology\nThe Duobuza porphyry deposit containing a resource of\u00a0\u223c\u00a02.8 million tonnes of copper is located in the center of the Duolong ore district (Fig. 3) and is hosted by Early Jurassic sandstone, Early Cretaceous quartz diorite and granodiorite porphyries that are related to mineralization. A barren quartz diorite porphyry crops out a few hundred meters away to the west to the copper orebodies. The alteration can be divided into potassic alteration, phyllic alteration and porphylitic alteration zone from mineralized porphyry center outwards and upwards (Sun et al., 2016). Potassic alteration is dominated by abundant magnetite, K-feldspar, biotite and quartz in the mineralized intrusions. Phyllic alteration occurs along structurally controlled zones and\/or as irregular sericite-quartz-pyrite outside potassic alteration. Propylitic alteration dominated by epidote, chlorite and carbonate occurs mainly in the basaltic andesite outside phyllic alteration. The porphyritic intrusions were emplaced between 121 and 116\u00a0Ma evidenced by zircon U-Pb age (Sun et al., 2016; Li et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytic methods\nIn order to examine cooling histories of deposits in the Duolong ore district, nine samples including granodiorite porphyry, diorite porphyry, andesite, sandstone, and cryptoexplosive breccia were collected from Naruo and Tiegelongnan deposits (Table 1\n, Fig. 3). One sample (DL2014-85) was collected from the surface and eight samples (ZK3220-903, ZK2301-148, ZK2301-236, ZK2301-492, ZK0801-549, ZK0801-359, ZK3124-150, ZK0801-108 where 0801 is the drill hole number and 108 is the sample depth in meters) were collected from the drill cores of the Tiegelongnan and Naruo deposits. Zircon and apatite crystals from these crushed rocks were separated (Fig. 4\n), and individual crystals were handpicked under a binocular microscope. Apatite and zircon grains were used for fission track and (U-Th)\/He dating.Table 2.\n\n\n\n4.1\nFission track dating\nThe rock samples were crushed, ground and sieved. The crushed particle size should correspond to the mineral grain size in the rocks. Both apatites and zircons concentrate were separated using conventional magnetic and heavy-liquid techniques. The zircon grains were mounted in glass slides, heated and covered by FEP Teflon sheets. Their external prismatic surfaces were ground and polished. Etching duration was about 20\u201335\u00a0h with NaOH\/KOH (=1:1) eutectic etchant at 210\u00a0\u00b0C (Yuan et al., 2003, Yuan et al., 2006b). Different from zircon, apatite was mounted in epoxy resin on glass slides, ground and polished to an optical finish to expose internal grain surface. Spontaneous tracks were revealed by 5.5\u00a0N HNO3 for 20\u00a0s at 21\u00a0\u00b0C. Thin low-uranium muscovites as external detectors were packed together with sample grain mounts and CN2 as well as CN5 uranium dosimeter glass irradiated in the well thermalized hot-neutron nuclear reactor (Bellemans, 1995; Yuan et al., 2006b). After irradiation, the muscovite external detectors were detached and etched in 40% HF for 20\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C to reveal the induced fission tracks (Yuan et al., 2003). Track densities for both natural and induced fission track populations were measured with a dry objective at 100\u00d7 magnification. Fission track ages (FTAs) were measured using the IUGS-recommended Zeta calibration approach. The Zeta values used in this study have been determined from repeated measurements of standard apatites (Hurford and Green, 1983; Hurford, 1990). The weighted mean Zeta value obtained in this paper is 391\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.8 a\/cm2 for apatite and 391\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 a\/cm2 for zircon. The fission track analysis experimental works were performed by the Beijing Zekang\u2019en Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n\n4.2\nApatite (U-Th)\/He dating\nApatite and zircon (U-Th)\/He dating of sample ZK3220-903 were undertaken at the John de Laeter Center for Isotope Research of Curtin University, Australia. Detailed description of the U and Th analysis can be found in Evans et al. (2005).\n(U-Th)\/He dating of the rest of apatite grains were conducted in 40Ar\/39Ar and (U-Th)\/He geochronology laboratory, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS). After the standard rock crushing and heavy liquid separation procedures, 3\u20135 relatively euhedral apatite grains free of visible inclusions and internal fractures were selected and measured under a microscope. Each grain was then wrapped in a 1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm platinum (Pt) capsule and loaded on a drilled oxygen-free copper disk. Helium measurement was performed using fully automatic helium extraction system called Alphachron MK II (Australian Scientific Instrument Pty Limited). After helium extraction, Pt wrapped grains were transferred to Savillex PFA vials and spiked with 230Th-235U solution with known concentration. All the spiked solutions were measured on a Thermo Fisher X-Series II inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Age calculation was conducted by a java based program named Helioplot (Vermeesch, 2010) and corrected for alpha emission following the procedure of Gautheron et al. (2009). Durango apatite was used as a reference standard to verify the analytical procedure. Detailed analytical procedure was described in Wu et al. (2016, Wu et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nFission track ages\nOne andesite and one sandstone samples from the Tiegelongnan deposit, three granodiorite porphyry and one diorite porphyry samples from Naruo deposit were analyzed using fission track method. The apatite and zircon fission track ages are expressed by the pooled ages shown in Table 2. The P(\u03c72) is a parameter that indicates all single-crystal ages represent a single population of ages where degrees of freedom\u00a0=\u00a0Nc\u20131 (Galbraith, 1981). Apatite fission track (AFT) ages of three granodiorite porphyry and one andesite samples belong to the same age group, and AFT age of one diorite porphyry sample (ZK2301-236) is mixing age as evidenced by P(\u03c72) smaller than 5% (Green, 1981). Andesite sample from Tiegelongnan yields AFT age of 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma with mean track length of 12.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0\u03bcm and Dpar value of 1.7\u00a0\u03bcm. Sandstone sample from Tiegelongnan yields AFT age of 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma with mean track length of 12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0\u03bcm and Dpar value of 1.84\u00a0\u03bcm. Three granodiorite porphyry samples from Naruo yield AFT ages ranging from 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma with mean track lengths ranging from 12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 to 12.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0\u03bcm, and Dpar value ranging from 1.44 to 1.69\u00a0\u03bcm. One diorite porphyry sample from Naruo yields AFT age of 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma with mean track length of 12.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0\u03bcm and Dpar value of 1.46 (Fig. 5\n). Three granodiorite porphyry samples from Naruo were analyzed using zircon fission track (ZFT) method and the ZFT ages range from 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n5.2\n(U-Th)\/He ages\nThree to four apatite and zircon grains were analyzed from each sample (Table 3\n). One sandstone sample from Tiegelongnan deposit were analyzed using zircon (U-Th)\/He (ZHe) method. Single grain ZHe ages of sandstone range from 108.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 to 118.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0Ma. One sandstone sample from Tiegelongnan deposit was analyzed using apatite (U-Th)\/He (AHe) method. The AHe ages of sandstone range from 32.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 to 98.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8\u00a0Ma. Two granodiorite porphyries, two diorite porphyries and one cryptoexplosive breccia samples from Naruo deposit were analyzed using AHe method. The AHe average age of two granodiorite porphyries, two diorite porphyries and one cryptoexplosive breccia range from 57.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1 to 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma after discarding the obvious outliers. The outliers were determined by the Dixon Criterion (Dean and Dixon, 1951) considering the limited age data for each sample.\n\n\n5.3\nHeFTy modeling\nIn order to investigate the extract geologic interpretations for the low-temperature thermochronological data. The thermal history of new AFT data in this study and published AFT data (Table 1) from Naruo, Tiegelongnan, and Duobuza were performed by HeFTy show coherent time\u2013temperature (t-T) paths (Ketcham, 2005). The annealing model for AFT data used was that of Ketcham et al. (2007), and Monte Carlo simulation was applied in our modeling. When the modeled cooling path matches the input data with a goodness of fit\u00a0>\u00a00.05, the model cooling path is considered acceptable, and if the goodness of fit is\u00a0>\u00a00.5, the model cooling path is considered good. To constrain the thermal history of the investigated samples, modeling results show good fit paths and acceptable fit paths displayed in different colors, with the best fit model paths show in black (Fig. 6\n).\nThe input parameters for modeling included AFT age, confined track length data, and the kinetic parameter Dpar. Based on the observation that the eruption of andesite at 110\u00a0Ma, and the eroded granodiorite porphyry of Tiegelongnan deposit was covered by the andesite, the time\u2013temperature (t-T) constraint was created to honor the fact that the temperature of andesite samples was near Paleo-surface which is assumed to be 20\u00a0\u00b0C at 110\u00a0Ma. Moreover, the crustal shortening due to intensive collisional orogeny from the late Early Cretaceous to the early Late Cretaceous (Chen et al., 2017) is consistent with the ZHe and ZFT ages ranging from 100 to 65\u00a0Ma in this study indicating that the Duolong ore district might have experienced thermal events between late Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous. Therefore, the ZHe and ZFT ages with zircon He partial retention zone and partial annealing zone were set as the low-temperature constraints. The AHe ages with their He partial retention zones were set as low-temperature constraints.\nThe samples yield similar thermal history models with two stages of reheating and two stages of cooling (Fig. 6). The samples were initially heated into the closure temperature of zircon He system (160\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C, Reiners et al., 2004) at 90\u00a0Ma and cooled rapidly to the closure temperature of apatite He system (45\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C, Farley et al., 1998; Wolf et al., 1998) at 80\u00a0Ma. Then, the samples were heated again into the closure temperature of apatite fission track (90\u2013120\u00a0\u00b0C, Laslett et al., 1987; Ketcham et al., 1999) between 70 and 65\u00a0Ma and passed through the closure temperature of apatite He system (45\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C, Farley et al., 1998; Wolf et al., 1998) at 40\u00a0Ma and finally cooled to 20\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nEvaluation of apatite (U-Th)\/He age\nMany factors including the presence of U- and Th-rich inclusions or fluid inclusion (e.g., Lippolt et al., 1994), He implantation from neighboring matrix (e.g., Spencer et al., 2004), variation in crystal size (e.g., Reiners and Farley, 2001), U and Th zonation (e.g., Farley et al., 1996; Dani\u0161\u00edk et al., 2010; Meesters and Dunai, 2002), radiation damage (e.g., Hurley, 1952; Nasdala et al., 2004; Shuster et al., 2006; Shuster and Farley, 2009) and imperfection of crystals (Hourigan et al., 2005; Farley et al., 2002) have been proposed to explain the intra-sample variation in single ages. Large apatite crystals will exhibit a higher closure temperature and yield older ages than smaller crystals experiencing the same thermal history because large crystals have a greater effective diffusion dimension and thus higher He retentivity than smaller ones (Farley, 2000). The effect of radiation damage may produce tens of degrees of variation in the closure temperature of apatite and lead to higher effective uranium concentration (eU) apatite undergoing less fractional He loss and yielding older age than in lower eU apatite grain for the same time\u2013temperature path (Flowers et al., 2009).\nNo positive correlation between equivalent spherical radius and (U-Th)\/He ages was revealed in samples from this study indicating that grain size is not the dominant factor accounting for the intra-sample dispersion in single-grain ages (Fig. 7\n). And there is no positive correlation between apatite AHe age and eU (Fig. 7) indicating radiation damage effect may not be the main cause of variation in (U-Th)\/He age. Moreover, cathodoluminescence (CL) images of apatite single grains from this study show no complicated zoning indicating U-Th zonation does not produce significant age bias in apatite AHe dating.\nOther possible reasons could be used to explain the intra-sample variation in ages: the effect of depth, cooling due to meteotic water (Li et al., 2014) and fault. The fission track and (U-Th)\/He ages generally decrease with the increase of depth (Coyle and Wagner, 1998; House et al., 1999; Lorencak et al., 2004; Stockli and Farley, 2004; S\u00f6derlund et al., 2005; Wolfe and Stockli, 2010). However, there is no significant negative correlation between fission track and (U-Th)\/He ages with depth (Fig. 8\n). The effect of depth is not the main reason for the intra-sample variation in ages.\nNo previous published crystalization ages of intrusive rocks or copper mineralization ages are younger than 120\u00a0Ma indicating that no significant magmatic-hydrothermal heating event occurred in the Duolong ore district since 120\u00a0Ma. Faults are developed in the region which could reset the fission track and (U-Th)\/He ages of nearby samples. Moreover, faults make it easier for meteoric water penetrate into the deposits and lead to cooling of samples. Therefore, the fault and meteoric water are the major factors that resulted in intra-sample variation in ages.\n\n\n6.2\nThermochronological ages in the Duolong ore district\nIn order to investigate the preservation and exhumation history of copper deposits in the Duolong ore district, the new achieved and published thermochronological data from the Tiegelongnan, Naruo, Duobuza, Dibao, Nadun and Tiegelong areas are plotted against elevation (Fig. 8). The thermochronological ages range from 112.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1 to 7.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma, most of which are concentrated between 75 and 40\u00a0Ma in the Duolong ore district (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The zircon (U-Th)\/He ages of 112.3 and 110\u00a0Ma in the Tiegelongnan deposit are believed to record the eruption of andesite at 110\u00a0Ma. Samples with ages between 70 and 65 are widely distributed in the whole Duolong ore district (Fig. 3). AFT ranging from 68 to 7.8\u00a0Ma show no obvious relationship on the age-elevation plot, the AHe average ages ranging from 85 to 23\u00a0Ma also show no obvious relationship on the age-elevation plot (Fig. 8). No reliable exhumation rate can be estimated from the age-elevation profile.\n\n\n6.3\nBurial process of the Jurassic strata\nOne sample (ZK3220-903) of the Middle-Lower Jurassic Sewa formation sandstone was collected from drill hole ZK3220 at depth of 903\u00a0m in the Tiegelongnan deposit. The sandstone was overlain by the Lower Cretaceous andesite lava, and the thickness between sample ZK3220-903 and overlying andesite is about 708\u00a0m as revealed by drill core of the ZK3220. The overlying sediments of Tiegelongnan deposit have been eroded for 1.4\u00a0km before the coverage of andesite as mentioned above. Therefore, the depth of sample ZK3220-903 was about 2100\u00a0m before the eruption of andesite which was not within the zircon helium partial retention zone. The ZHe age of sample ZK3220-903 is 112.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1\u00a0Ma which is consistent with U-Pb zircon age of andesite (110\u00a0Ma, Wang et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2018) within analytical uncertainty at\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u03c3 level. The ZHe age is thought to record the andesite eruption.\nThe thickness of andesite is about 260\u00a0m in the Tiegelongnan deposit indicating that the burial depth of sample ZK3220-903 was about 960\u00a0m at 110\u00a0Ma. The AHe age of ZK3220-903 is 62.7\u00a0Ma which indicates the depth of ZK3220-903 was about 2\u00a0km at 62.7\u00a0Ma assuming the geothermal gradient of 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and the closure temperature of apatite He system of 70\u00a0\u00b0C (Farley et al., 1998; Wolf et al. 1998). Therefore, the Middle-Lower Jurassic Sewa formation sandstone is thought to have experienced a stage of burial between 110\u00a0Ma and 62.7\u00a0Ma (Fig. 6d) with minimum burial thickness of 1040\u00a0m. The sample then experienced a period of exhumation since 62.7\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n6.4\nEffect of faults on deposit preservation\nAll the samples with ZHe, ZFT and AHe ages ranging from 106 to 80\u00a0Ma are located in the Naruo, Tiegelongnan, and Duobuza deposits distributed along northeast-southwest striking fault (Fig. 3a and 8, Table 1). The fault movement might have caused the samples to pass through zircon He partial retention zone, partial annealing zone and apatite He partial retention zone between 106\u00a0Ma and 80\u00a0Ma. Therefore, ages of 106\u201380\u00a0Ma are believed to record the thermal effect of northeast-southwest striking fault on the deposits. The effect of fault on the deposit is also revealed by the mineral barometer study which shows that the emplacement depths of mineralized and barren quartz diorite porphyry cropped out in the Duobuza deposit are 2.5\u00a0km and 6.5\u00a0km, respectively (Sun et al., 2016). The fault likely has resulted in the upward movement of barren porphyry relative to mineralized porphyry due to they both exposed on the surface of Duobuza deposit. The mineralized porphyry moved downward between 106 and 80\u00a0Ma as a result of the northeast-southwest striking fault movement which caused the burial of the mineralized porphyry. The burial thickness is about 2\u00a0km at 80\u00a0Ma assuming the geothermal gradient of 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and the closure temperature of apatite He system of 70\u00a0\u00b0C.\nSamples with ages ranging from 70 to 65\u00a0Ma mainly distributed in Naruo, Tiegelongnan, Duobuza and northeast of the Duolong ore district. Liu et al., (2017) puts forward that compressional orogeny related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision produced the thrust nappe structure in the Duolong ore district at Late Cretaceous (75\u201370\u00a0Ma) which is consistent with ages of 70\u201365\u00a0Ma within the error range in this study. Therefore, the 70\u201365\u00a0Ma record the thrust nappe structure at Late Cretaceous which caused the burial of the deposit. The burial caused the andesite samples passing through apatite partial annealing zone, and the thickness of buried strata was up to 4\u00a0km by 70\u201365\u00a0Ma assuming the geothermal gradient of 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and the closure temperature of apatite fission track of 120\u00a0\u00b0C (Laslett et al., 1987).\n\n\n6.5\nExhumation and preservation history of the Duolong ore district\nBoth climate and tectonic events affect the exhumation processes that is acting at the Earth\u2019s surface (Willenbring and von Blanckenburg, 2010; Herman et al., 2013). Climate is driving erosion and mineral exposure in deposit-bearing mountain landscapes (Yanites and Kesler, 2015). Weighted mean paths of the thermal history modeling results were integrated with compiled regional tectonic and paleoclimatic evolution data to explore the exhumation and preservation history of the Duolong ore district (Fig. 9\n).\n\nEarly Cretaceous (120\u00a0\u223c\u00a0110\u00a0Ma): The Duolong ore district was formed as a result of subduction of the Bangongco-Nujiang Neo-Tethys Oceanic crust at Early Cretaceous (Tang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2019; Song et al., 2018). The ore-related intrusive rocks (\u223c120\u00a0Ma) of Tiegelongnan porphyry-epithermal deposit and Duobuza porphyry deposit intruded at depth of 1.4 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a02.5\u00a0km, respectively (Fig. 10\na, Sun et al., 2016, Yang et al., 2014). We assumed the emplacement depth of Naruo deposit is about 3\u00a0km which is consistent with the formation depth of most porphyry deposits (Sillitoe, 2010). The Duolong area experienced a significant exhumation between 120 and 110\u00a0Ma based on the observation that the ore-related granodiorite porphyry was overlain by andesite at Tiegelongnan deposit (Lin et al., 2016), the exhumation thickness is about 1.4\u00a0km and exhumation rate is about 0.14\u00a0km\/m.y. (Fig. 10b) according to the emplacement depth of ore-related intrusive rocks in Tiegelongnan determined by fluid inclusion results (Yang et al., 2014).\n\nEarly Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous (110\u00a0\u223c\u00a080\u00a0Ma): The ZHe and ZFT ages and thermal history modeling document a reheating in the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 9). This reheating is likely related to movement of northeast-southwest striking fault between 106 and 80\u00a0Ma, when the closure of the Bangongco-Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean lead to Lhasa-Qiangtang collision (Zhu et al., 2015a,b). The northeast-southwest striking fault in the Duolong ore district is believed to be the result of intensive collisional orogeny which resulted in the shortening across the Bangongco-Nujiang suture zone (Zhang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2006; Kapp et al., 2005). As mentioned above, the fault resulted in the downward movement and burial of ore-related porphyries in the Duolong ore district, the estimated burial thickness is 2\u00a0km at 80\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10c).\n\nLate Cretaceous (70\u00a0\u223c\u00a065\u00a0Ma): The Duolong ore district experienced another reheating between 70 and 65\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9). The reheating in this period is likely related to the thrust nappe structure caused by the continued collision of Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes at Late Cretaceous (Liu et al., 2017a,b). The thrust nappe structure caused another burial process of deposits. Based on the closure temperature of apatite fission track, it is speculated that the total thickness of overlying strata reached 4\u00a0km by the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 10d).\nThe post-mineralization burial process in the Duolong ore district is similar to those happened in some porphyry or epithermal systems (i.e. late Paleozoic epithermal gold deposits in Chinese Western Tianshan, Devonian Oyu Tolgoi deposit, Late Devonian Tsagaan Suvarga porphyry deposit, Paleozoic Yandong porphyry deposit) which played an important role in preservation of ancient copper deposits (Wainwright et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a,b; Tungalag et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2021).\n\nLate Cretaceous to present (65\u00a0\u223c\u00a00\u00a0Ma): The Duolong ore district started to experience exhumation since Late Cretaceous as evidenced by AFT age, AHe age and thermal history modeling (Fig. 9). The exhumation thickness is about 4\u00a0km, and exhumation rate is about 0.062\u00a0km\/m.y. assuming the geothermal gradient of 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and the closure temperature of apatite fission track of 120\u00a0\u00b0C (Laslett et al., 1987). This period of exhumation is attributed to the India-Asia collision which had a significant impact on the Qiangtang terrane (Wang et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2016; Rohrmann et al., 2012). In response to the India-Asia collision, the gradual thickening of lithosphere caused the lithospheric delamination of the northern Qiangtang terrane which would have induced rapid uplift of the central Tibet during Eocene (46\u201338\u00a0Ma, Chen et al., 2013). The AFT and AHe ages of 49\u201338\u00a0Ma in the Duolong ore district likely recorded this rapid uplift induced by lithospheric delamination (Fig. 10e).\nA warm and humid climate prevailed in the central Tibet during Eocene to Miocene (Fig. 9, Mao et al., 2019; Su et al., 2019, 2020; Fang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018a,b; Spicer et al., 2021) which would increase exhumation rates (Yanites and Kesler, 2015). The overlying strata was then exhumed since Cenozoic and Naruo, Tiegelongnan and Duobuza deposits were uplifted to the present elevation.\n\n\n6.6\nPreservation mechanism for the Early Cretaceous porphyry deposit in Tibet\nA serious of ore deposits including the Duolong ore district (i.e., the Tiegelongnan porphyry-epithermal Cu (Au) deposit, Duobuza and Bolong porphyry Cu deposits, the Naruo and Duobuzaxi porphyry copper deposits, Tang et al., 2014, 2016, 2021; Wang et al., 2017a,b; He et al., 2017), the Fuye skarn Fe-Cu deposit (Chen et al., 2014), the Caima skarn Fe-Cu deposit (Zhang et al., 2011), the Qingcaoshan porphyry Cu-Au deposit (Li et al., 2017), the Gaerqiong-Galale skarn Au-Cu deposit (Zhang et al., 2015), the Balaza porphyry-skarn Cu-Mo-Au deposit (Zhang et al., 2015), the Shesuo skarn Cu deposit (Zhao et al., 2011) and Xiongmei porphyry Cu deposit (Qu et al., 2012) distributed along the Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt. Most of these porphyry deposits have Early Cretaceous ages and typically formed at shallower depths (<4 km, Sillitoe, 2010). Previous geochronological studies show that porphyry deposits worldwide typically have Phanerozoic ages, with a particularly strong Cenozoic age population (Singer et al., 2008). The temporal distribution of porphyry deposits indicates that older deposits likely have been destroyed by continuous erosion (Leng et al., 2018). The Early Cretaceous Tiegelongnan porphyry-epithermal deposit which formed at depth of 1.4\u00a0km (Yang et al., 2014) has not been completely eroded making the Duolong ore district an important place to understand the preservation mechanism of Early Cretaceous porphyry-epithermal deposits in the Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt.\nThe northeast-southwest striking fault and thrust nappe structure related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision caused two stages of burial in the Duolong ore district which is supported by our ZHe, AFT and AHe ages. At least 4\u00a0km of sediments would have covered the Duolong ore district which might protect the Naruo, Tiegelongnan and Duobuza deposits from erosion. The lithospheric delamination caused by India-Asia collision has resulted in uplift and exhumation events in the Duolong ore district since Paleocene. The exhumation thickness in this period is up to 4\u00a0km calculated from the closure temperature of apatite fission track. Such strong exhumation process could remove the overlying sediments and lift the Duolong ore district to present level. Therefore, the burial related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision is the result that the Duolong ore district could be preserved in the circumstance of subsequent uplift and exhumation. Our study also supports that the thick crust and high elevation of central Tibet started since the Cretaceous (Kapp et al., 2005, Kapp et al., 2007).\nOur research shows that faults related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision played an important role in deposit preservation, especially for older porphyry-epithermal deposit (e.g. the Tiegelongnan deposit). The footwall of northeast-southwest striking faults in Duolong ore district is the key area for ore prospecting in the future. The India-Asia collision is the main reason for the uplift and exhumation of the deposits. We believe that there is a great potential to explore other Early Cretaceous porphyry-epithermal deposits in the Bangongco-Nujiang metallogenic belt.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nNew fission track dating, (U-Th)\/He dating, and thermal history modeling along with published thermochronological data suggest that the Duolong ore district has experienced complex preservation and exhumation processes since Early Cretaceous. At least two stages of exhumation and two stages of burial were revealed in the Duolong ore district. The Duolong ore district experienced a stage of exhumation immediately after the ore formation (\u223c120\u00a0Ma) when part of orebody was eroded. Subsequently, the northeast-southwest striking fault and the thrust nappe structure related to Lhasa-Qiangtang collision resulted in the deposits to be covered by 4\u00a0km of sediment between 110 and 65\u00a0Ma. The overlying strata was totally eroded and deposits were lifted as a result of lithospheric delamination caused by the India-Asia collision since 65\u00a0Ma.\nThe burial related to the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision is the main mechanism of deposit preservation. The exhumation related to India-Asia collision played a vital role in uplift of the deposits in Duolong ore district. The combination of Lhasa-Qiangtang collision, India-Asia collision contribute to the present elevation of the Duolong ore district.\n\n","39":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nRhenium is one of the rarest and most dispersed elements in the Earth\u2019s upper crust and its annual production does not exceed 50 tons. This element has a strong affinity for sulphur and occurs mainly as a substitute for molybdenum in molybdenite (MoS2) which makes it the principal source of Re. Molybdenites from porphyry copper deposits usually contain 100\u20133000\u00a0ppm of Re but in some cases, high concentrations up to 4.7% of Re were reported (Voudouris et al., 2009; John et al., 2017). Currently nearly all of the primary production of rhenium is a by-product of copper mining, with porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold deposits supplying about 80 % of its primary production (Polyak, 2018; U.S. Geological Survey, 2020). The rest is extracted from sediment hosted stratabound copper deposits (SSC) in Poland and Kazakhstan. Cu-Ag deposits in the Lubin-Sieroszowice district are operated by KGHM PM S.A. and were responsible for around 18% of the annual Re production in 2018 (U.S. Geological Survey, 2020). In contrast to molybdenite present in porphyry copper deposits, which have been extensively studied due to Re-Os dating being one of the \u201cgold standards\u201d of geochronology (e.g. Berzina et al., 2005; Voudouris et al., 2013; Pa\u0161ava et al., 2016; Barra et al., 2017), there is a surprisingly large gap in knowledge regarding the occurrence of rhenium in SSC deposits. Although copper mineralization in Poland, Germany and Kazakhstan is strongly enriched in Re compared to the average crustal value, geological processes responsible for this phenomenon remain not fully understood. A longstanding, unresolved question regarding Kupferschiefer mineralization in Poland is the mineralogical host of Re. Copper minerals (Kijewski and Jarosz, 1987), molybdenum phases (Kucha, 1990) and organic matter (Kijewski and Jarosz, 1987) were suggested as Re carriers but low adundances (at ppb-ppm levels) and low resolution of available analytical methods in the past, made more precise investigations tremendously difficult.\nLaser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) emerged as a solution to the problem of measuring in-situ low-concentrations of trace elements in minerals at the micron-scale and has been successfully implemented to a broad range of ore minerals, such as sphalerite (e.g. Cook et al., 2009; Frenzel et al., 2016), chalcopyrite (e.g. Wohlgemuth-Ueberwasser et al., 2015; George et al., 2018), pyrite (Large et al., 2009; Gregory et al., 2015), tetrahedrite-tennantite (George et al., 2017), bornite, chalcocite (Cook et al., 2011), pyrrhotite (Duran et al., 2016), galena (George et al., 2015), arsenopyrite (Lawley et al., 2015) and magnetite (Dare et al., 2014). The method was applied to samples representing virtually all major types of magmatic and hydrothermal mineral deposits (see e.g. Cook et al., 2016 and references therein) with a notable omission: sediment rock hosted stratiform copper deposits (SSC). They account for approximately 23% of the world\u2019s copper production and known reserves (Singer, 1995), but are also world\u2019s largest producing deposit type for cobalt and fourth largest producing deposit type for silver (Hayes et al., 2015), primarily on account of two supergiants: the Central African Copperbelt and the European Kupferschiefer, respectively (Hitzman et al., 2005).\nFormation of SSC deposits in general seems to be rather well understood: they form by precipitation of sulphides at the redox interface by oxidation\u2013reduction reactions and show broad similarities in terms of mineralization style and mineralogy. They usually form stratabound to stratiform disseminations in siltstones, shales, sandstones and carbonates with ore minerals usually occurring as cements, replacements and veinlets. These deposits are commonly characterized by lateral and vertical metal (and mineral) zonation with the general sequence: Fe3+ zone (hematite) \u2013 redox proximal Cu zone (chalcocite, bornite, chalcopyrite) \u2013 Pb and Zn zone (galena and sphalerite) \u2013 distal Fe2\u00a0+\u00a0zone (pyrite) (Hitzman et al., 2005).\nAt the first glance, this group of deposits might not seem to be an attractive target for in-situ trace element studies. These ores are widely considered to form at low temperatures (75\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C) from oxidizing brines circulating through red beds without involvement of magmatic fluids or direct link to magmatism (Wodzicki and Piestrzy\u0144ski, 1994; Oszczepalski, 1999). Redox conditions can separate metals quite efficiently, leaving little trace elements available for incorporation into major sulphides. Moreover, their features cause several obstacles for LA-ICP-MS measurements: mineralization is often fine-grained, disseminated and non-homogenous; intergrowths and aggregates with gangue minerals are common so spot selection for laser ablation is challenging. Despite these obstacles, LA-ICP-MS might provide an important insight into formation of the SSC deposits. Substantial size, variety of ore textures and multistage origin adds considerable variation to apparent simplicity. In the case of the Kupferschiefer, hematization is the only extensive alteration and with scarcity of fluid inclusions data it is more difficult to characterize ore forming fluids and untie the evolution of the hydrothermal system responsible for deposit formation. Although there is a plethora of whole rock data for the Cu-Ag deposits in the Fore-Sudetic Monocline in Poland, detailed mineral chemistry data are scarce. Investigating trace elements in sulphides with much greater accuracy than available with electron microprobe, can potentially help to paint a more detailed picture of the ore forming processes. Additionally, although copper and silver are the main commodities, mines in Poland exploiting SSC deposits also produce significant amount of by-products (Pb, Re, Pt, Pd, Au, Ni, Se). Mineralogical hosts for some of these elements (most notably rhenium) are not well understood and LA-ICP-MS studies can shed a new light on this matter.\nDespite some challenges, the lack of LA-ICP-MS data for this group of deposits in the literature is baffling, especially as they provide an opportunity to study ore systems where redox conditions play a dominant role and can overshadow factors such as temperature, salinity and pH of hydrothermal fluids in controlling trace element partitioning. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of such investigations, to provide in-situ trace element data for common ore minerals from the Cu-Ag Lubin-Sieroszowice district and to determine whether sulphides can constitute a major rhenium carrier.\n\n\n2\nGeological settings\nThe Kupferschiefer (copper bearing shale) strata occurs in the Southern Permian Basin in Europe, which extends from the United Kingdom through North Sea, northern Germany to Poland. It gave name to one of the subtypes of SSC deposits, where the reduced sediments containing organic matter overlie oxidized, hematite-bearing sandstone, siltstone, and (or) conglomerate (red beds) deposited in an arid climate (Zientek et al., 2015). The world-class Lubin-Sieroszowice copper district in southwestern Poland is a classic example of this type of mineralization and as such its geological setting has been extensively studied and described in numerous papers (e.g. Tomaszewski, 1978; Oszczepalski, 1999; K\u0142apci\u0144ski and Peryt, 2007; Pieczonka et al., 2008). It is located in the SW part of the Fore-Sudetic Monocline, adjacent to the northern boundary of the Fore-Sudetic Block (Fig. 1\n). The basement of the Monocline is composed mainly of Proterozoic and early Paleozoic gneisses, schists, phyllites, granitoids and deformed Carboniferous conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones. They are overlain by Permian sediments which are part of the European Permian sedimentary basin formed in the final stages of the Variscan Orogeny (McCann et al., 2006). The Variscan foreland in Europe was subjected to extensive rift-related tectonism and related magmatic activity resulting in Lower Rotliegend (\u201cAutunian\u201d) beds composed of red-colored clastic sediments and bi-modal volcanics composed of rhyolites, rhyolitic tuffs and trachybasalts. The Upper Rotliegend (\u201cSaxonian\u201d) are essentially terrestrial beds composed of aeolian sandstones interbedded with deposits of alluvial fans, braided rivers and playas characteristic of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine sedimentary environments in a land-locked basin and arid climate (Karnkowski, 1999; Kiersnowski and Buniak, 2006; McCann et al., 2006). In the Late Permian, the continental Rotliegend Basin has been rapidly flooded in a catastrophic sea transgression (Gast et al., 2010), an event analogous to the Zanclean flood which rapidly refilled the Mediterranean Sea after the Messinian salinity crisis 5.33\u00a0Ma ago (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009). As a result of transgression, the uppermost part of the Rotliegend was reworked and redeposited forming gray white sandstone called Weissliegend (Glennie and Buller, 1983). Its thickness varies from <1\u00a0m up to 40\u00a0m. Locally, mainly in the south-eastern part of the district, the Basal Limestone, in the mine district called \u201cboundary dolomite\u201d, overlies the Weissliegend and is up to 0.3\u00a0m thick (K\u0142apci\u0144ski 1971; K\u0142apci\u0144ski and Peryt, 2007). The Kupferschiefer is a thin (average 0.3\u00a0m-thick) layer of black, marine, organic-bearing shale, forming the base of the Zechstein succession (Fig. 2\n). It was formed under anoxic, euxinic bottom waters (Paul, 2006) and represents a change of the deposition conditions from oxidized to reduced sediments. The Zechstein sediments in the South Permian Basin are subdivided into carbonate-evaporite cyclothems reflecting progressive evaporation and chemical precipitation in a large saline basin. Marine carbonate sediments (limestones or marls) form the base of each cycle and are followed by layers of evaporates, mainly of anhydrite and halite. Zechstein rocks in Poland are subdivided into four evaporitic cycles, referred to as PZ1 (Z1 Werra), PZ2 (Z2 Stassfurt), PZ3 (Z3 Leine), and PZ4 (Z4 Aller) (K\u0142apci\u0144ski and Peryt, 2007). The Kupferschiefer is overlain by the Zechstein Limestone (Ca1) which grades upwards from dolomitic to calcitic and is followed by the Lower Anhydrite (A1d), the Oldest Halite (Na1), and the Upper Anhydrite (A1g) constituting the first cyclothem series (Z1 Werra).\nThe Cu-Ag sulphide mineralization occurs in the contact zone between the Zechstein and Rotliegend groups and is not restricted to the Kupferschiefer layer. It occurs in the Weissliegend, the Basal Limestone, the Kupferschiefer and the Zechstein Limestone units (Fig. 1) and the majority of the reserves is in fact hosted by sandstone. An important feature is the presence of a red coloured hematitic footwall alteration zone (\u201cred spots\u201d, \u201cred stains\u201d) closely associated with ore-grade mineralization of the Kupferschiefer and called the Rote F\u00e4ule. It is usually considered to form by secondary oxidation (e.g. Oszczepalski, 1999) resulting from the flow of oxidizing fluids through the Kupferschiefer, probably during diagenesis. Other papers suggest the existence of more than one Rote F\u00e4ule facies with only some of them linked with ore-grade mineralization. Kucha (1995) distinguished 4 types of syngenetic \u201cred spots\u201d and 4 types of epigenetic \u201cred spots\u201d although differentiation criteria are not precisely defined. Differences between two separate phases of \u201cred spots\u201d, i.e. older spots originated from synsedimentary or early diagenetic processes, named \u201cdiagenetic oxidation stage (DOS)\u201d and younger, epigenetic \u201csecondary oxidation stage (SOS)\u201d overprinting earlier DOS and associated with enrichment in precious metals, were highlighted by Pieczonka (2000), Pieczonka and Piestrzy\u0144ski (2000), Piestrzy\u0144ski et al. (2002), Pieczonka et al. (2008). These authors suggest that oxidizing brines responsible for deposition of noble metals and epigenetic \u201cred spots\u201d (SOS system) postdate the formation of economic-grade copper mineralization and should be treated separately from the DOS system. Samples with hematite alteration investigated in this study represent the epigenetic variety of \u201cred spots\u201d related to noble metals mineralization.\nThe depositional age of the Kupferschiefer is generally accepted as 258\u00a0Ma (Menning et al., 2006; Peryt et al., 2012) but age of the mineralization proved to be more difficult to constrain. Different geochronological methods point toward Late Permian-Early Triassic (Jowett et al., 1987; Nawrocki, 2000; Alderton et al., 2016; Nawrocki 2017), Late Triassic (Mikulski and Stein, 2015, 2017), Late Triassic-Early Jurassic (Bechtel et al., 1999; Alderton et al., 2016) and Late Jurassic (Symons et al., 2011) time periods. Most authors agree that mineralization processes were long-term and took place in several stages (Wodzicki and Piestrzy\u0144ski, 1994; Michalik and Saw\u0142owicz, 2001; Alderton et al., 2016). The main mineralizing process was the migration of low-temperature, oxidizing, metalliferous chloride brines sourced from the paleo-depressions filled with Rotliegend red bed sediments, through the anoxic basal sediments of the Zechstein Group (Jowett, 1986).\nSix mining areas (Deep G\u0142og\u00f3w, Lubin-Ma\u0142omice, Polkowice, Radwanice-Gaworzyce, Rudna, and Sieroszowice, Fig. 1) have been established in the district and are operated by KGHM PM S.A. In recent years, the exploration drilling program of Miedzi Copper Corporation (MCC) allowed preliminary documentation of three new \u201cdeep\u201d Cu-Ag deposits in the Fore-Sudetic Monocline: Nowa S\u00f3l, Moz\u00f3w and Sulmierzyce North (Zieli\u0144ski and Speczik, 2017; Oszczepalski et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nSamples and methods\nSamples used for this study, representing typical mineral assemblages and the most common ore textures of the Cu-Ag deposit in the Fore-Sudetic Monocline, come from the collection of Department of Economic Geology, AGH University of Science and Technology, consisting of samples collected over the past 45\u00a0years in the Lubin, Rudna and Sieroszowice-Polkowice underground mines.\nSamples considered suitable for measurements can be divided into 4 major groups:\n\na)\nSulphide veinlets and thin veins (up to 1\u00a0cm) in the shale, concordant with lamination and often associated with finely disseminated sulphides; represented by chalcopyrite (Fig.\u00a03\na, Fig.\u00a04\na-c), bornite, sphalerite (Fig.\u00a03b, Fig.\u00a04d) and chalcocite. Two of these samples, Ko11-2339\u2013103 and Sr10-3484\u2013104 (consisting of chalcopyrite veinlets in shale with chalcocite, digenite (Cu9S5), djurleite (Cu31S16) and bornite disseminations) were added due to bulk rock geochemistry data indicating rhenium enrichment (1.85 and 18.4\u00a0ppm of Re respectively).\n\n\nb)\nMore irregular and massive mineralization represented by massive djurleite lens\/vein at the boundary between shale and carbonates (Fig.\u00a03c); by chalcocite (Fig.\u00a03d, Fig.\u00a04e) and covellite (Fig.\u00a03e, Fig.\u00a04f) in the Weissliegend sandstone; and by massive collomorphic bornite and chalcocite in organogenic limestone.\n\n\nc)\nEpigenetic massive sulphide (\u00b1carbonates) veins, up to 10\u00a0cm thick, usually steep and commonly fault\u2013related, in some cases cementing and impregnating breccia zones. Ore assemblage consists mainly of chalcopyrite (Fig.\u00a03f), with minor bornite, sphalerite (Fig.\u00a04g), galena and tennantite.\n\n\nd)\nSulphide mineralization inside or in the vicinity of the secondary oxidation zones (SOS system, not to be confused with supergene processes) characterized by the widespread presence of disseminated hematite (\u201cred spots\u201d), locally associated with noble metals mineralization. They are represented by chalcopyrite (Fig.\u00a04h), pyrite (Fig.\u00a03g, Fig.\u00a04i), and djurleite (Fig.\u00a03h).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, two representative samples of chalcopyrite from the Nchanga deposit (Zambian Copperbelt) were analysed for reference.\nThe suite of samples was biased towards coarse-grained, inclusion-free sulphides, disseminated mineralization was not analysed. Additionally, they tend to be rather monomineralic with the exception of fault-related epigenetic sulphide-carbonate veins (chalcopyrite-bornite-sphalerite) and sample WZ-18 with collomorphic bornite and chalcocite. Optical light microscopy was used to characterize ore minerals and select spots for further analyses, paying particular attention to mineral inclusions, intergrowths, zoning, cracks or other textural aspects, all of which may impact on trace element distribution. Nonetheless, even relatively thick sulphide veinlets in the Kupferschiefer contain numerous inclusions of shale matrix (Fig.\u00a04c-d) and in these cases, multiple spots were picked and analysed to minimize their influence (e.g. prioritizing sectors with less inclusions, see Fig.\u00a04c as an example). Samples were studied by electron microprobe to assess the content of major elements, which would be used as the internal standard during LA-ICP-MS measurements. In cases where the EPMA data was not available, stoichiometric concentrations of Cu for copper sulphides and S for sphalerite and pyrite were assumed and used as the internal standard. Microprobe analyses (EPMA) of chalcopyrite, djurleite, sphalerite, covellite, bornite and chalcocite were carried out using a JEOL JXA-8230 SuperProbe at the Laboratory of Critical Elements AGH-KGHM in Krak\u00f3w. The electron microprobe was operated in the wavelength-dispersive mode at an accelerating voltage of 20\u00a0kV and a probe current of 20nA. Counting times of 20\u00a0s on peak, and of 10\u00a0s on both (-) and (+) backgrounds were used for all elements except In and Ge where 40\u00a0s on peak and 20\u00a0s on both (-) and (+) backgrounds were used. The following standards and spectral lines were used for sulphides: FeS2 (FeK\u03b1, SK\u03b1), chalcopyrite (CuK\u03b1), ZnS (ZnK\u03b1), Ag (AgL\u03b1), stibnite (SbL\u03b1), CdS (CdL\u03b1), GaAs (AsL\u03b1), Sb2Se3 (SeL\u03b1), GeS (GeL\u03b1) and HgS (HgM\u03b1). Data were corrected by the ZAF procedure using JEOL software for electron microprobe. Presence of djurleite, suggested by Cu\/S atomic ratios in measured phases, was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).\nTrace element contents were measured at the Department of Applied Geosciences and Geophysics, Montanuniversit\u00e4t Leoben, Austria, using an ESI NWR213 Nd:YAG laser ablation system coupled to an Agilent 8800\u00ae triple quadrupole ICP-MS. Helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.75\u00a0L\/min. Fluency was set between 2 and 3\u00a0J\/cm2. For sphalerite and pyrite analyses, the matrix-matched sintered pressed powder pellet reference material MUL-ZnS 1 (Onuk et al., 2017) was used as the external standard for quantification of the element content and the USGS powder pressed polysulphide reference material MASS-1 (Wilson et al., 2002) was used for quality control of the analyses. The MASS-1 reference material was used as the external standard for quantification of chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite and djurleite. Data reduction was done using the Iolite V4.0 software. Integration intervals for calculating absolute concentrations in \u00b5g\/g were chosen on smooth spectra concordant with the signals of the internal standard and other major elements of the different sulphides. The following isotopes were analysed: 51V, 55Mn, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 63Cu, 71Ga, 74Ge, 75As, 82Se, 95Mo, 107Ag, 111Cd, 115In, 118Sn, 121Sb, 125Te, 185Re, 195Pt, 197Au, 201Hg, 205Tl, 208Pb, 209Bi. Sphalerite (MUL-ZnS1) and sulphide (MASS-1) reference materials were periodically analysed (every 14 spots) for quality control. As MASS-1 contains little Re (0\u00a0\u00b5g\/g according to Feng et al., 2018 and 0.504\u00a0\u00b5g\/g according to Sen et al., 2010) and Pt, NIST-612 reference material was used to quantify the content of these elements. Ablation spots were carefully selected in an effort to analyse sulphides free of obvious inclusions or cracks; nevertheless, samples locally display inhomogeneity on the scale of the ablation spot. A consistent 50\u00a0\u03bcm diameter spot size was used for all measurements.\nDue to the isobaric interference between 113In and 113Cd, 115In was primarily used to estimate the concentration of In. The interference of 115Sn on 115In was insignificant as Sn content in analysed sulphides was sufficiently low and the 115Sn isotope abundance is just 0.34%. Ge suffers from various interferences on its isotopes (e.g. 72Ge with 40Ar32S and 56Fe16O; 73Ge with 40Ar33S, 57Fe16O, and 56Fe16O1H; 74Ge with 40Ar34S and 58Ni16O; Belissont et al., 2014) while measured with ICP-MS and thus provides a challenge for confident determination of low concentrations (Cook et al., 2009). The 74Ge isotope was chosen for this study to minimize potential interferences in Cu-Fe sulphides following Belissont et al. (2014) who have shown that at least in the case of sphalerite, the 74Ge isotope seems to be the most suitable one due to relative isotopic abundance and negligible interferences. Despite potential interference contributions of TmO+ in 185Re, HfO+ in 195Pt and TaO+ in 197Au determination, the lithophile nature of Tm, Hf and Ta suggest their concentrations in sulphides would be sufficiently low to not affect results in a meaningful way. 185Re isotope was preferred as 187Re has a potential isobaric interference not only with YbO+ but also with 187Os. In the majority of samples, no signal was detected for 185Re, 195Pt and 197Au suggesting concentrations below detection limit (in most cases below 0.1\u00a0\u00b5g\/g). The non-matrix matched reference material (NIST 612) used for Re and Pt might decrease the confidence in the low concentration values reported here and can be considered as semiquantitative; nonetheless, the presence or lack of signals for 185Re, 195Pt and 197Au itself is considered an important information.\nDue to intergrowths and inhomogeneity, results obtained from 21 samples (7 from the Rudna, 6 from the Sieroszowice-Polkowice and 6 from the Lubin mine) were considered to be of sufficiently good quality to be presented here. Data for 5 chalcocite\/djurleite, 1 covellite, 2 bornite, 3 sphalerite, 1 pyrite and 12 chalcopyrite samples amounts to a total of 225 in situ LA-ICP-MS spots. A complete list of samples with their description can be found in Table 1\n.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nOverview\nResults of the measurements are presented in the Table 1 and Appendix A with an overview provided as box and whisker plots in Figs. 5 and 6\n\n. When compared with other measured sulphides, chalcocite\/djurleite shows enrichment in Ag and Bi but also depletion in V, Co, As, Sn; in the case of covellite higher content of Mn, Ga, Mo, Tl, Pb, Bi is noticeable; bornite has higher Sn, higher and more variable Co; chalcopyrite is enriched in Ge and Sb while sphalerite is characterized by increased content of Cd and Hg with simultaneous depletion in As, Ag and Pb (Fig. 5). Data for V, Co, Ni, Ga, Ge, As, Mo show significant variation within given mineral which could be explained by two factors.\nFirstly, distinct trace elements composition reflects different mineralizing fluids and\/or processes. Data for chalcopyrite split according to ore texture (Fig. 6) show clear contrast. Epigenetic chalcopyrite veins have high concentrations of Ge and As (or In, Sb and Bi instead of Ge and As in sample LB-6) while chalcopyrite found in the zone of \u201cred spots\u201d (sample CP-1) is enriched in Ge, Se, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi (Fig. 6, Fig.\u00a07\nb-f) in comparison to its counterpart occurring as concordant, shale-hosted veinlets. In fact, \u201cred spots\u201d chalcopyrite is characterized by the highest contents of selenium (median 4207\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) and Hg (median 614\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) among all measured sulphides. Djurleite associated with the \u201cred spots\u201d (sample CC-P-1) is enriched in V, Co, Ni, As, Se, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi when compared with other chalcocite\/djurleite samples. Pyrite near the \u201cred spots\u201d zone is rich in Tl (median 130\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) and As (median 5333\u00a0\u00b5g\/g). Additionally, \u201cred spots\u201d associated djurleite (but not chalcopyrite or pyrite) is unique due to consistently detectable signals of Au and Re (up to 0.5 and 0.9\u00a0\u00b5g\/g respectively, Fig.\u00a07b, Table 1). Enrichment in Hg, Tl, V, Se with occasional Re and Au seems to be a characteristic feature of sulphides found in the \u201cred spots\u201d areas, clearly differentiating them from the bulk Cu-Ag ore.\nSecondly, the dataset for chalcocite, bornite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite can be split into two distinct groups: the first consists of more massive mineralization (e.g. epigenetic veins, massive chalcocite in sandstone) while the second is represented by shale hosted, bedding parallel veins and veinlets, often rich in inclusions of gangue minerals. The latter group is characterized by higher concentration and substantially more variable data for some elements (e.g. V, Ni, Co), which in turn are often absent in the samples from the \u201cmassive mineralization\u201d group (Fig. 6, Table 1). This variation suggest that trace elements content can be related to the host rock, more specifically it might be affected by mico- and\/or nanoinclusions associated with them. Micrometer-size Kupferschiefer matrix inclusions (predominantly a mixture of clay minerals, silica, organic matter and carbonates in various proportions) enclosed by crystallizing ore minerals, could be enriched in many metals (e.g. Co, Ni, Mo) in contrast to remnants of either Weissliegend sandstone matrix or Zechstein carbonates. Although we did our best to minimize the effect of inclusions, their influence cannot be completely excluded. Fig. 7 presents selected time-resolved downhole ablation spectra where subparallel and smooth lines are generally indicative of lattice-bound elements or evenly distributed nano-scale inclusions while \u201crugged\u201d patterns suggest the presence of micro-inclusions (Pb in Fig.\u00a07d is a clear example of microinclusions). Si, Al and Ca should be used in future studies as a proxy for tiny shale-matrix inclusions, nonetheless it can be hard to unambiguously distinguish them in time-resolved spectra, especially in case of less abundant elements with multiple possible hosts (e.g. Mn, Co, Ni). Some of the spots were unsuitable for data reduction because ablated material turned out to contain a significant portion of shale matrix, but in return they could provide clues how to interpret results affected by non-sulphide material. Stepanov et al. (2020) present a method of measuring fine-grained pyrite intergrowth with silicate matrix in sedimentary rocks, involving analysis of both pyrite and pyrite-free sediment matrix and regression of time-resolved LA-ICP-MS data. While quantification of trace element requires several steps, for our purpose we can simply use raw counts along with single ablation spot to assess whether the trace elements in this particular area are hosted within the copper sulphides (strong correlation with Cu and S) or other phases interpreted as shale matrix (elements strongly correlated with each other but not with Cu and S). Especially useful are samples with a clear transition between sulphide and shale, e.g. ablation of a relatively large inclusion just below the sulphide surface (Fig. 8\n). Visual inspection of the time resolved downhole spectra, coupled with calculation of statistical correlation between counts (Appendix B), allow to prepare a provisional classification of elements. Two clusters of elements stand out: one with affinity to chalcopyrite (Cu, Fe, S) including Ag, Tl, Sb, Pb (+Ge, As, Hg) and a second one consisting of Ni, V, Ga, Sn, Co, Mo (+Mn) which can be associated with Kupferschiefer matrix. Despite exceptions (e.g. strong Mo enrichment in sulphide in sample LZ 03), it seems that variation in V, Ni, Co, Ga, Mo, Sn in chalcopyrite (Fig. 6) can be attributed to shale matrix inclusions. Not enough data was available for similar analysis regarding chalcocite, bornite and sphalerite but analogous explanation for high variations of these elements seems to be plausible. Elements with no clear preference include Se, In, Cd and Bi. Se and Cd have relatively high detection limits which might generate the apparent inert characteristic but a noticeable feature is the very low content of indium in almost all measured sulphides (Fig. 5, Table 1, Appendix A). Almost 55% of all spots have below 0.1\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of In, while only 15% has\u00a0greater than\u00a01\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of In (chalcopyrite sample LB6 with up to 222\u00a0\u00b5g\/g In being the exception and outlier).\n\n\n4.2\nRhenium, silver and germanium\n\n185Re signals were consistently detected only in djurleite (samples WZ-14 and CC-P-1); after data reduction most spots gave values above detection limits (up to 3.9\u00a0\u00b5g\/g in sample WZ-14, Fig.\u00a07a-b, Fig. 9\n, Appendix A). This indicates that djurleite is a preferential host for Re among all analysed Cu sulphides, thus, processes responsible for its formation could be also linked with Re enrichment. Djurleite in the vicinity of the \u201cred spots\u201d zone (Fig. 9) is quite distinct: in comparison with chalcocite samples it is enriched in V, Co, Ni, Se, Tl, Pb, Bi (Fig. 6, Fig.\u00a07b; although shale matrix inclusions could be a source of V, Co and Ni). Copper sulphides in Re-enriched, shale hosted samples Ko11-2339\u2013103 and Sr10-3484\u2013104 were too fine-grained and contained too many inclusions to quantify trace element content with sufficient confidence. Therefore, the data were not included in the results presented in the Appendix A. Semiquantitative measurements of 10 spots in a chalcopyrite vein from sample Sr10-3484\u2013104 (Fig. 10\n) suggest that the Re content does not exceed 1.6\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Re and cannot account for 18.4\u00a0ppm Re revealed in bulk-rock geochemistry. Potential candidates for Re hosts include disseminated Cu-S sulphides or shale matrix\/organic matter related phases.\nSilver is the most important by-product in the Lubin-Sieroszowice district and the highest silver content has been measured in djurleite and chalcocite (Figs. 5\u00a0and\u00a07a), with values up to 3814\u00a0\u00b5g\/g, in agreement with the results obtained with EPMA (Table 2\n). Hundreds \u00b5g\/g of Ag were also measured in bornite and covellite, while chalcopyrite shows a lot of variation: some of them contain hundreds of \u00b5g\/g of Ag (median 473\u00a0\u00b5g\/g in sample B-1\u20131) while others contain only single \u00b5g\/g of Ag (median 6.4\u00a0\u00b5g\/g, sample WZ-20). Kozub-Budzy\u0144 and Piestrzy\u0144ski (2017) report EPMA determined concentrations of Ag in copper minerals from the Lubin-Sieroszowice district as follows: chalcocite 0.40\u201311.97\u00a0wt%, bornite 0.13\u20138.66\u00a0wt%, digenite 0.06\u20133.21\u00a0wt%, covellite 0.21\u20130.40\u00a0wt% and\u00a0<\u00a00.14\u00a0wt% in chalcopyrite. Mikulski et al. (2020) present Ag contents for chalcocite (2.54\u20136.28\u00a0wt%), bornite (up to 3.30\u00a0wt%), digenite (up to 3.55\u00a0wt%), djurleite (up to 0.91\u00a0wt%), geerite (Cu8S5, 0.34\u201310.1\u00a0wt%), yarrowite (Cu9S8, 0.18\u20130.66\u00a0wt%), and chalcopyrite (up to 0.08\u00a0wt%). Although silver minerals (native silver, silver amalgams, stromeyerite, naumannite) have been identified in the deposit, their abundance is low. Therefore the bulk of the Ag enrichment in the copper ore is hosted by common copper sulphides (Ag-bearing bornite and chalcocite) (Kozub-Budzy\u0144 and Piestrzy\u0144ski, 2017).\nHigh concentrations of Ge (up to 4806\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), accompanied by increased concentrations of As (up to 1045\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) have been measured in chalcopyrite from the epigenetic sulphide-calcite veins (samples WZ-20, RU-W2, RUG 3a; Fig.\u00a07c, Table 1). EPMA confirms the high Ge content in sample WZ-20; results also reveal significant variation (Table 2, <0.03\u20130.15\u00a0wt% Ge while LA-ICP-MS data for this sample fall in the range 11.38\u20132402\u00a0\u00b5g\/g). Ge-As-Sb rich chalcopyrite has been found in samples from both the Sieroszowice-Polkowice and Rudna mines and likely represents a more common phenomenon. Slightly elevated Ge content is also observed in chalcopyrite near \u201cred spots\u201d (sample CP-1, up to 25\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Ge). Iron-poor sphalerite crosscutting Ge-rich chalcopyrite is not particularly rich in germanium (up to 6.5\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Ge), similarly to the sphalerite veinlet in a shale (sample SPH-S1, up to 9.4\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Ge).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nAn element zonation sequence of Fe3+-Cu-Pb-Zn-Fe2+ as well as mineral zonation (hematite-chalcocite-bornite-chalcopyrite-galena-sphalerite-pyrite) from the contact with the red beds into the reduced, ore-bearing sediments is a common feature of sedimentary rock hosted stratiform copper systems (e.g. Hitzman et al., 2005; Borg et al., 2012). This raises the question whether similar zonation patterns can be observed for trace elements. While for most of the measured elements this is not the case, Fig. 5 reveals a clear pattern for Ag (almost linear decrease from chalcocite\/djurleite\u00a0>\u00a0covellite\u00a0>\u00a0bornite\u00a0>\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0>\u00a0sphalerite when concentrations are shown in log scale) and Pb (increase from chalcocite\u00a0<\u00a0bornite\u00a0<\u00a0chalcopyrite followed by sharp drop for sphalerite). It suggests that Ag distribution on a scale of the district, could be controlled by the redox conditions and follow general mineral zonation in SSC deposits. Among copper sulphides, chalcocite\/djurleite seems to be a favourable host for Bi and Re, while chalcopyrite for Sb (Fig. 5). Trace elements in Kupferschiefer ores also vary depending on the location in the district (e.g. Kijewski and Jarosz, 1987; Bana\u015b et al., 2007; Kijewski and Wirth, 2011; Kozub-Budzy\u0144 and Piestrzy\u0144ski, 2017; Mikulski et al., 2020, with references therein), mineral assemblage, and texture (e.g. Wodzicki and Piestrzy\u0144ski, 1994; Kucha, 2007; Pieczonka et al., 2008) and data presented in this paper imply that particular trace element signatures seem to be linked to a certain mineralization style as well (Fig. 11\n).\n\n5.1\nStages of mineralization\n\n5.1.1\nReduced vs oxidized (SOS) facies\nThe ore-bearing series can be subdivided into two contrasting facies: reduced (dark grey, rich in organic matter, containing sulphides) and oxidized zones (red, organic matter deficient, hematite-bearing, usually Cu-Ag barren but in some cases enriched in Au-Pt-Pd), with the highest Cu grades usually surrounding oxidized areas. Organic geochemistry, especially parameters such as S2\/S3 (HI\/OI) ratio, total organic carbon (TOC) and oxygen index (OI) obtained during Rock-Eval pyrolysis (Oszczepalski and Rydzewski, 1991; Oszczepalski, 1999; Bechtel et al., 2002; Wi\u0119c\u0142aw et al., 2007) reveal a third, transitional zone. Two episodes of oxidation have been postulated by Pieczonka (2000), Pieczonka and Piestrzy\u0144ski (2000), Piestrzy\u0144ski et al. (2002), Pieczonka et al. (2008). The first one is related to the bulk of the copper accumulation (DOS, diagenetic oxidation stage) and the second one, at higher temperatures, is responsible for Au-Pt-Pd enrichment (SOS, secondary oxidation stage). Although sulphide accumulations in the oxidized strata (both DOS and SOS), are usually finely disseminated and rarely sufficiently large for LA-ICP-MS measurements, we were able to obtain data for pyrite, chalcopyrite and djurleite associated with the \u201cred spots\u201d related to the SOS system. Although the set of samples is limited, results show distinct contrast between sulphides constituting the bulk of Cu-Ag ore and sulphides in samples with intense hematitic alteration (Figs. 5 and 6). Those from the \u201cred spots\u201d are particularly enriched in certain elements: chalcopyrite and djurleite in V, Se, Hg and Tl, while pyrite in Tl and As. In general, sulphides from both reduced and SOS zones, do not contain measurable quantities of Re, Au and Pt with the exception of sample CC-P-1 (djurleite in shale adjacent to \u201cred spots\u201d; both Re and Au are indicated with sufficient confidence). Application of a matrix-matched reference material might result in different values, but it will most likely fall within the same order of magnitude as reported here. We consider sample CC-P-1 to represent high grade Cu mineralization adjacent to the oxidized (SOS) areas and formed by remobilization of copper ore via influx of oxidizing fluids and a moving redox front. These results are consistent with increasing U, Co, V, Bi, Hg, Se and Tl in the direction of the oxidized zone (Oszczepalski and Rydzewski, 1997). Electron microprobe data presented by Chmielewski (2014) and Oszczepalski et al. (2017) show that sulphides in the oxidized and transition zone tend to contain Hg (up to 1.02\u00a0wt% in chalcopyrite) and Se (for example up to 0.78\u00a0wt% in bornite, up to 0.61\u00a0wt% in chalcopyrite, up to 0.16\u00a0wt% in pyrite and up to 1.14\u00a0wt% in covellite). EPMA data for sulphides from the Sieroszowice-1 borehole, which was recently reinvestigated by Oszczepalski and Chmielewski (2017), reveal that while chalcopyrite and pyrite in Zechstein limestone and Kupferschiefer contain 0.00\u20130.03\u00a0wt% Se (only one out of 37 measurements gave 0.08\u00a0wt% Se), selenium content rapidly increases in sulphides from the Weissliegend sandstone (0.15\u20130.17\u00a0wt% Se). While minerals such as clausthalite PbSe, naumannite Ag2Se (Pieczonka et al., 2008), tiemannite HgSe (Salamon, 1976), eugenite Ag11Hg2 (Kucha, 1986), thalcusite Tl2Cu3FeS4 (Oszczepalski and Chmielewski, 2017; Pieczonka et al., 2019) have been found in the mineralization from the Fore-Sudetic Monocline (usually in the \u201cred spots\u201d zones and areas enriched in Au-Pt-Pd, although PbSe also in galena-rich zones), high values of Se and Tl in sulphides measured by other authors via EPMA not necessarily are caused by intergrowths with these phases. Our data prove that elevated content of Se, Tl, Hg is also hosted in the structure of sulphides or as evenly distributed nano-inclusions rather than microinclusions (Fig.\u00a07f). In this regard sulphides from oxidized areas (SOS) are remarkably different from those found in reduced part of ore-bearing series (Fig. 6).\nOne of the interesting topics regarding SSC deposits is how they are related to and affected by tectonic evolution, i.e. from the basin initiation and rifting, up to basin inversion. Kupferschiefer deposits in Central Europe are of special interest in this regard, because in contrast to other \u201cgiants\u201d such as African Copperbelt or Udokan, they are undeformed and not metamorphosed. Trace elements can record the chemistry of hydrothermal fluids depending on parameters such as temperature (e.g. Frenzel et al., 2016), pH, and oxygen fugacity, and therefore can be a useful proxy for fluids and their sources. While some authors link both Cu-Ag as well as Au-Pt-Pd mineralization to the same fluids forming single mineralizing system (e.g. Oszczepalski, 1999; Cathles, 2019), others suggest that the precious metals enrichment associated with \u201cred spots\u201d formed in a separate phase, overprinting earlier copper mineralization (Pieczonka, 2000; Pieczonka and Piestrzy\u0144ski, 2000; Piestrzy\u0144ski et al., 2002; Pieczonka et al., 2008). Results presented here indicate that sulphides in the \u201cred spots\u201d zones exhibit a trace elements pattern that is clearly distinct from the bulk Cu-Ag mineralization (Fig. 6) and support the idea that these two types should be treated separately.\n\n\n5.1.2\nEpigenetic ores\nWhile ore minerals present as disseminations and veinlets appear to have occurred early in the mineralization history, epigenetic veins crosscutting lithology indicate overpressure and formation after lithification. Clear differences in trace element data between these two styles of mineralization (Fig. 6) are due to the group of epigenetic Ge-As-Sb rich chalcopyrite veins (samples RUG-3a, RU-W2, WZ-20) and epigenetic vein with chalcopyrite enriched in Zn (median 1467\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), Sn (median 334\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), Bi (median 304\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) and In (median 180\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) (sample LB-6, Fig.\u00a07e). These veins likely represent a distinct and separate, later stage of deposit formation (Fig. 11) and could represent a promising target for \u201chigh-technology\u201c metal such as Ge and In. However, whether these differences in trace elements point to a different fluid source or stem from different formation mechanism remains unknown. Although a four point isochron Re-Os age of chalcopyrite veinelts parallel to shale lamination has been determined by Mikulski and Stein (2015) as 212\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma, model Re-Os ages for these four samples (concordant veins and veinlets in the shale) range from 268 to 256\u00a0Ma (Mikulski and Stein, 2017). Crosscutting veinlet perpendicular to lamination gave a model age of 217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (Mikulski and Stein, 2010). This might suggest the presence of a crosscutting phase of mineralization overprinting an earlier stage of Permian mineralization (240\u2013255\u00a0Ma), at least in the case of shale-hosted thin veinlets. However, the problem of fault-related, thicker chalcopyrite veins as well as the question of how much metals have been introduced during the epigenetic phase and how much has just been remobilized from existing material remains open for discussion and further investigation.\n\n\n5.1.3\nTemperature estimations\nTemperature estimation for the formation of Cu-Ag Kupferschiefer deposit are typically based on the parameters of organic matter (e.g. up to 130\u00a0\u00b0C, Bechtel et al., 1995). Results of vitrinite reflectance (Speczik and Puttmann, 1987) indicate that the temperature of mineralizing fluids in most cases did not exceed 100\u00a0\u00b0C but higher temperatures are correlated with a second major maturation process which took place after the main stage of mineralization. Djurleite is stable at low temperatures, and on heating above 93\u00a0\u00b0C it reverts reversibly to high digenite and hexagonal \u201chigh chalcocite\u201d (Roseboom, 1966; Potter, 1977; Evans, 1979), similar to the \u201clow chalcocite\u201d and \u201chigh-chalcocite\u201d transition at 103.5\u00a0\u00b0C (Roseboom, 1966). As organic matter maturation cannot be reversed, only the maximum temperature can be documented and any later or prior cooler fluids are not recorded. Due to the lack of suitable host minerals, few data on fluid inclusions from the Lubin-Sieroszowice district is available in literature. Measurements on the epigenetic ore veins continuing below and above the stratabound Kupferschiefer orebody gave homogenization temperatures of 145\u00b0 \u2212 160\u00a0\u00b0C for smaller gas liquid inclusions and 180\u00b0 \u2212 200\u00a0\u00b0C for larger ones which often contain solid phases and liquid carbon dioxide (Strengel-Martinez et al., 1993). Fluid inclusions incorporated in the carbonate cement of the clastic Weissliegend point to homogenization temperature of about 120\u00a0\u00b0C (Vaughan et al., 1989). The Ga-Ge-In-Mn-Fe-in-sphalerite geothermometer (GGIMFis, Frenzel et al., 2016) utilizing trace element concentrations may provide new independent data on temperature estimation. Unfortunately, due to inclusions as well as In and Mn values below detection limit, only 2 spots (both in sample RUG \u2212 3a, epigenetic vein) could be used, giving 122\u2013123\u00a0\u00b0C. For a provisional estimation, substituting Mn and In with the detection limit value into GGIMFis, gave temperatures in the range 79\u2013113\u00a0\u00b0C. Due to the fact that both Mn and In are denominators in the GGIMFis formula, these values are likely overestimated. Future studies are needed to determine whether the apparent difference between temperature estimation for bulk mineralization and epigenetic veins represent real phenomena or is just an artefact caused by limited number of samples and limitations of analytical methods. Except for Fe, the LA-ICP-MS data for sphalerite presented here resemble those from deeply seated, carbonate-hosted (Zechstein - Ca2) MVT-alike Zn-Fe-Pb-sulphide mineralization in the Lower Saxony Basin (NW Germany), formed by fluids expelled from an over-pressurized system during Late Cretaceous basin inversion (Nadoll et al., 2019; So\u015bnicka and L\u00fcders, 2019). Similarities include significant Cd values in the range of X000 \u00b5g\/g and low median values (<1 \u00b5g\/g) of Ga, In, Tl (Knorsch et al., 2020) but preliminary data presented here might indicate lower range of temperatures (Lower Saxony Basin: GGIMFis temperatures 148\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055\u00a0\u00b0C, Knorsch et al., 2020; homogenization temperatures of sphalerite-hosted inclusions: 125\u00b0 \u2212 208\u00a0\u00b0C, So\u015bnicka and L\u00fcders, 2019). Chemical composition of sphalerites from the Kupferschiefer also show strong similarities (Cd in the X000 \u00b5g\/g range, Fe-low, low values of Ga, Ge, In) to those from the Ghanzi-Chobe Belt portion of the Kalahari Copper Belt (Kelepile et al., 2020) where fluid inclusion studies suggest trapping temperatures of the mineralizing fluids between 150\u00b0and 350\u00a0\u00b0C (Hall et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n5.2\nGermanium\nGermanium does not form specific deposits but is found in minor and trace amounts in various types of mineralization, with economic concentrations in only a handful of them (see extensive reviews by Bernstein, 1985; H\u00f6ll et al., 2007; Melcher and Buchholz, 2014). Most of the Ge-bearing sulphide ore originates from low temperature, epigenetic zinc deposits, hosted predominantly in carbonate rocks (Bernstein, 1985; H\u00f6ll et al., 2007) where it occurs as substitution in the structure of sphalerite and wurtzite with discrete germanium minerals usually absent (Melcher and Buchholz, 2014). Scarcity and selectivity of germanium data in sediment hosted stratiform copper deposit makes their potential difficult to assess but Melcher and Buchholz (2014) evaluated it as \u201cmedium\u201d, the same evaluation as volcanic-hosted Kuroko-type Cu-Zn(\u2212Pb) (\u2212Ba), porphyry and vein-stockwork Sn-Ag and Kipushi-type polymetallic deposits. Germanium was recovered from the Kupferschiefer ore containing 8\u201315\u00a0ppm of Ge prior to mine closure in the Mansfeld area (Harz mountains, Germany), but more detailed information is lacking (H\u00f6ll et al., 2007; Melcher and Buchholz, 2014). According to Bana\u015b et al. (2007), copper ores in the Lubin-Sieroszowice district contain on average 1\u00a0ppm of Ge, but locally it can be enriched up to 10\u00a0ppm. Despite such low concentrations, Van Nhan (1970) reported a possible occurrence of argyrodite in chalcocite-bornite ore in dolomitic shale samples from the Lubin East field, while Hara\u0144czyk (1975) described two new germanium minerals, morozeviczite Pb3Ge1\u2013xS4 and polkovicite (Fe,Pb)3(Ge,Fe)1\u2013xS4. These minerals were found in epigenetic veins occuring in a zone of tectonic cracks within sandstone below Zechstein sediments but since the time of their discovery, they have not been found anywhere else. According to an overview on trace elements in the copper ore in the Fore Sudetic Monocline by Kijewski and Jarosz (1987), chemical assays from the stage of deposit documentation show germanium in the range of 0.1\u20135\u00a0ppm, present as substitution in stromeyerite (up to 0.38%), in digenite, bornite, chalcopyrite (0.15\u20130.18%), in covellite and in galena but they do not specify what analytical method was used for these measurements, nor what was the location, stratigraphic position or texture. Data presented here show even higher enrichment in germanium (up to 4806\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) coupled with high content of arsenic (up to 1045\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) in chalcopyrites from the carbonate hosted epigenetic sulphide-calcite veins, associated with local faults and tectonic zones. Time resolved ablation profiles reveal that germanium in chalcopyrite probably occurs as substitution in the crystal lattice or is present as evenly distributed nano-inclusions rather than micro-inclusions of Ge-bearing phases (Fig.\u00a07c). Such high levels of Ge content in chalcopyrite, coupled with additional enrichment in Sn, have been reported in the re-mobilized Barrig\u00e3o copper vein deposit from the Iberian Pyrite Belt where up to 0.64% of Ge in chalcopyrite has been determined with EPMA (Reiser et al., 2011) and up to 6260\u00a0\u00b5g\/g with LA-ICP-MS (Belissont et al., 2019). LA-ICP-MS measurements of chalcopyrite from the Kipushi deposit (D.R. Congo) gave 180\u2013647\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Ge (Belissont et al., 2019). With the exception of a \u201cred spots\u201d sample with a median of 21.2\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Ge, the Ge content in remaining Kupferschiefer chalcopyrite is low, usually below 1\u00a0\u00b5g\/g and only slightly higher in sample B-1\u20131 (stratiform, concordant chalcopyrite; median 6,5 \u00b5g\/g of Ge). Notably, bornite from the epigenetic vein, replacing Ge-rich chalcopyrite (sample WZ-20), contains on average only 4.1\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Ge (up to 8.7\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) while sphalerite veins, crosscutting the same Ge-rich chalcopyrite, contain no more than 1.5\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Ge. Kupferschiefer-hosted stratiform sphalerite has a median value of 1.3\u00a0\u00b5g\/g and contains no more than 10\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Ge. Therefore, in Kupferschiefer ores, chalcopyrite and Cu phases might be more favourable hosts for Ge than sphalerite. It\u2019s worth to point out that Ge-enrichment appears to be a more widespread phenomenon in the Lubin-G\u0142og\u00f3w Copper District as it occurs in several samples from both the Sieroszowice-Polkowice and Rudna mines. Germanium is not reported in chemical assays of Kupferschiefer samples (e.g. Mikulski et al., 2020), partly due to analytical problems (Dulski, 1999). Therefore, germanium might have been overlooked in the past and the potential in terms of Ge grades and resources is in fact underestimated while data presented here clearly show that these copper ores should be regarded as potential perspective target for germanium. The origin of such enrichment remains enigmatic and requires further studies; at this stage of research we can only speculate whether fluids responsible for formation of epigenetic veins might be enriched in germanium relative to fluids responsible for the majority of stratiform mineralization and\/or the process of vein formation itself (involving overpressure and hydraulic fracturing) might play a role.\n\n\n5.3\nRhenium\nThe first important investigation focused on rhenium occurrence in mineralization from the Fore-Sudetic Monocline in Poland, utilized a self-devised spectrographic method (Gralikowski, 1967). The highlights included association of rhenium with high grade, organic matter-rich copper ore; the notion that the correlation between Re and Cu is stronger than between Re and Mo (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.738 and 0.34 respectively) and a speculation that Re enrichment might be connected with chalcocite. Gralikowski (1967) also reported the variability in Re content in terms of the ore type: 0.7\u20134\u00a0ppm for the sandstone ore, 1.4\u20133.7\u00a0ppm for the shale ore and 0\u20130.8\u00a0ppm for the carbonate ore. The main focus of his paper was on the analytical method and unfortunately geological aspects have been neglected. Kanasiewicz (1966, 1967) investigated rocks in the North-Sudetic Trough in Poland and concluded that while there is no significant rhenium - molybdenum correlation, a strong correlation with copper exists. His interpretation was that metals precipitated from seawater, rejecting hypotheses that late hydrothermal fluids were responsible for the rhenium enrichment in the copper bearing shales. Mikulski et al. (2020) report bulk-rock Re concentrations in the range of\u00a0<\u00a00.05 to 68.7\u00a0ppm (n\u00a0=\u00a071) with an arithmetic mean of 5.8\u00a0ppm. They confirm that the correlation of rhenium with molybdenum (r\u00a0=\u00a00.36) is weaker than rhenium and copper (r\u00a0=\u00a00.55). Interestingly, they also showed a strong correlation between rhenium and bismuth (r\u00a0=\u00a00.74).\n\nKijewski and Jarosz (1987) summarized unpublished studies and reports. The highest rhenium concentrations occur in the footwall of the bituminous shale where rhenium is found as substitutions in minerals of molybdenum (0.2\u20131.2% of Re admixture), copper and iron. According to them, rhenium admixture in chalcocite, pyrite, djurleite, chalcopyrite and bornite can be surprisingly high (up to 1\u00a0wt%). The second most important carriers of rhenium are organometallic complexes and kerogen (concentrations 5\u201335\u00a0ppm of Re) which host around 10% of the total rhenium budget (Kijewski and Jarosz, 1987). In contrast to previous papers, Kucha (1990) claims that molybdenum phases, mainly castaingite ((Cu,Fe)Mo2S5), are the principal host of rhenium in the deposit with an average Mo\/Re ratio of 70:1. This opinion was repeated by Alderton et al. (2016) where they declare that castaingite accounts for about 75% of the Mo content, and thus is the main host for by-product Re and Mo. These assertions seem to be based on results presented in Kucha et al. (1994), where PIXE analyses showed 1030\u00a0ppm of Re in castaingite, as well as data in Kucha (2007) where (K,Cu)Mo2S4 and (Pb,Cu)Mo2S4 phases are shown to contain 0.18\u20130.43 % of Re. These results are limited to few samples of rare Mo-phases so their extrapolation to the entire deposit needs to be taken with caution. More recently, Kijewski and Wirth (2011) provided a summary of rhenium occurrence and production in the Lubin-Sieroszowice district with a focus on the shale unit, as data for other lithologies are fragmental. They point out that on the scale of the entire deposit operated by KGHM PM S.A., there is no definitive connection between molybdenum and rhenium in the copper bearing shale. Molybdenum is found in the entire area of the documented orebody while rhenium occurs mainly in the southern part of the deposit. The northern, much deeper part of the orebody, contains significantly less rhenium. This is also indicated by the data presented here, where chalcopyrite in sample LZ 03 is rich in Mo (median value 665\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) but contains no detectable Re. Kupferschiefer-type copper deposits in the Mansfeld-Sangerhausen district in Germany are also known to be enriched in rhenium (0.25\u201327\u00a0ppm, highest in the copper facies of Kupferschiefer; Hammer et al., 1990) but there is no detailed report regarding its mineralogy (Jankowski, 1995; John et al., 2017).\nThere is a limited number of papers tackling rhenium occurence in other sediment rock hosted copper deposits such as Box et al. (2012) covering the Dzezkazghan deposit (Kazakhstan). Nevertheless, additional data can be obtained as a by-product of papers focused on Re-Os dating (e.g. Schneider et al., 2007; Trist\u00e1-Aguilera et al., 2006; Mikulski and Stein 2015, 2017; Pa\u0161ava et al., 2007a; Selby et al., 2009). In general, chalcopyrite contains little rhenium (at ppt-ppb level) but in some cases, chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite can contain up to a few ppm of rhenium (e.g. Selby et al., 2009; Box et al., 2012).\n\nPa\u0161ava et al. (2010) analysed unmineralized Kupferschiefer samples from the Zdrada IG-8 borehole (northern Poland) and obtained concentrations of Re between 64 and 1376\u00a0ppb (isochron age of the rock 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0Ma). In these samples, rhenium strongly correlates with molybdenum and is concentrated in the lower part of the black shale. Analyses of mineralized bulk-rock samples (Pa\u0161ava et al., 2007a) show rhenium concentrations between 249 and 22174\u00a0ppb (age 240\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0Ma). Re-Os dating of the mineralization from the Mansfeld area in Germany (P\u00e4tzold et al., 2002) revealed 3\u2013956\u00a0ppb of Re in the Kupferschiefer sample and 5\u2013130\u00a0ppb of Re in the underlaying conglomerates. According to the authors, a Re\u2013Os age of 204.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma favours an epigenetic origin of the Kupferschiefer mineralization in this area. Alderton et al. (2016) reported a distinct Re enrichment in the sulphide samples (1.1 to 8.8\u00a0ppm), demonstrating that Mo-bearing phases cannot be the only Re carrier and based on the results of Re-Os dating, they presented a multistage model of ore precipitation. Publications by Mikulski and Stein (2010, 2015, 2017) focus on measuring isotopes directly in the separated copper minerals (chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite) instead of whole rock samples. Chalcopyrite and bornite analysed by them contains very little rhenium (5.71\u201312.12\u00a0ppb Re), two orders of magnitude lower than the usual rhenium content in the deposit.\nHighly oxidized and PGE enriched samples of the Kupferschiefer contain between 212 and 558\u00a0ppb Re and show isochron ages of the mineralization older than the age of the host rock (Pa\u0161ava et al., 2007b). It is not surprising that oxidizing fluids related to the mineralizing processes can disturb the Re-Os system as rhenium and osmium are highly soluble under oxidizing conditions. Xiong et al. (2006) conducted experiments and analysed the solubility of rhenium in hydrothermal conditions, updating earlier studies on this topic. The most favourable conditions for rhenium transport under subcritical conditions are in the hematite stability field with redox conditions as controlling factor. If the oxygen fugacity is only 0.97 log units lower than that of the boundary between ReS2(s) and ReO2(s), the concentration of rhenium that is transportable in the stability field of ReS2(s) drops by 4 orders of magnitude. The authors concluded that rhenium in the SSC deposits could be transported by highly oxidizing hydrothermal fluids regardless of pH. They also speculate that the reduced part of the weathering zone in porphyry deposits might be enriched in Re due to the leaching of this metal from the sulphides by oxidizing fluids.\nLA-ICP-MS data show lack of or very low counts of 185Re (if monitored), indicating Re content below detection limit in almost all sulphide samples reported here. However, there are two notable exceptions where Cu-S sulphides seem to be a preferential host for rhenium. Carbonate-hosted massive djurleite and chalcocite (WZ-14 and WZ-18) reveal a median value of 0.67\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Re (up to 3.86\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Re), while sample CC-P-1 where shale-hosted djurleite is adjacent to \u201cred spots\u201d gave a median value of 0.3\u00a0\u00b5g\/g (up to 0.9\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) (Table 1, Appendix A). Either the structure of djurleite might be favourable for Re incorporation or the processes responsible for djurleite formation could be also linked with Re enrichment. Reversible phase transitions from djurleite to high digenite and hexagonal \u201chigh chalcocite\u201d at 93\u00a0\u00b0C (Roseboom, 1966; Potter, 1977; Evans, 1979) might play a role. Although \"red spots\" chalcopyrite or pyrite do not contain any measurable Re, our results suggest that djurleite located right at the redox front might constitute a favourable host for rhenium, especially in areas where oxygen fugacity increases enough to rapidly decrease rhenium solubility as described by Xiong et al. (2006). Although more data is necessary for confirmation, we suggest that rhenium enrichment in the deposit might be at least partially controlled by influxes of oxidizing fluids into the Kupferschiefer unit and linked with copper ore remobilization. These fluids were responsible for formation of the high grade Cu ore and Au-Pt-Pd mineralization (SOS system), explaining why Re enrichment is found mainly in the southern part of the deposit (Wirth and Kijewski, 2011). Although rhenium in SSC deposits such as the Kupferschiefer might be present in rare phases such as rheniite, tarkianite, castaingite and dzhezkazganite, the majority of this metal is likely dispersed in much more common copper sulphides.\n\n\n5.4\nRegional specificity?\nQuestion to what degree common ore-forming processes control trace elements concentrations and how significant in comparison is local \u201cflavour\u201d (e.g. source rock and host rock) provides an interesting problem. In the case of sediment hosted stratiform copper deposits it boils down to the question which trace element (TE) patterns are common worldwide and reflect universal features of mineralizing fluids and which are specific for a given sedimentary basin and can vary between districts. So far there is little available literature providing LA-ICP-MS trace element data for SSC deposits such as Central African Copperbelt, White Pine or Udokan, most notably Kelepile et al. (2020) present data from the Ghanzi-Chobe Belt portion of the Kalahari Copper Belt. Therefore, we included in the investigated samples chalcopyrite from the Nchanga deposit (Zambian Copperbelt) and the most obvious differences in comparison to Kupferschiefer samples are much lower contents of Ag, Mo, Sb, Tl, and Pb coupled with higher contents of In and Sn (Table 3\n). More data is necessary to assess whether this pattern is just a result of local variation or it represent more fundamental feature e.g. basin-specific trait of the mineralization dependant on source rocks or\/and parameters of mineralizing fluids in the Southern Permian Basin and Katangan Basin respectively. When compared with the Kupferschiefer, mean TE concentrations in chalcopyrite reported by Kelepile et al. (2020) are lower in the case of Mo (in almost all samples mean Mo\u00a0<\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00b5g\/g with an exceptional value of 2241\u00a0\u00b5g\/g in one sample) and Sb (0.02\u20135.9\u00a0\u00b5g\/g), comparable for Ag (1.3\u201399\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) and Tl (0.01\u20133.7\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) while slightly higher for In (0.5\u201327\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) and Sn (0.55\u201319\u00a0\u00b5g\/g) making structurally controlled mineralization in the Ghanzi-Chobe Belt more similar to Nchanga than to Lubin-Sieroszowice district in this regard. Future studies need to pay particular attention to mineral paragenesis as coexisting phases could constitute a sink for selected trace elements and affect the trace element partitioning into copper sulphides.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nSulphides from the Cu-Ag Kupferschiefer deposit present certain challenges for LA-ICP-MS measurements. In contrast to carbonate- and sandstone-hosted massive and vein mineralization, shale-hosted veins, veinlets and replacements contain numerous inclusions of shale matrix (clay minerals, organic matter and carbonates) which can affect the results and need to be taken into account. Even though careful petrographic observations, precise spot selection and repeating spots within a given sample help to minimize the effects of inclusions, they still might cause variations in TE content for elements such as V, Mn, Ni, Co, Ga, Mo, Sn. Time resolved spectra for non-homogenous spots, where significant portions of ablated material turns out to be shale matrix, help to assess if the measured signal for a given trace element come from sulphide or shale. The data evaluation leads to the following provisional classification of elements: Cu, Fe, S, Ag, Tl, Sb, Pb are strongly affiliated with chalcopyrite; Ni, V, Ga, Sn, Co, Mo are strongly affiliated with Kupferschiefer matrix; In, Cd are indifferent, while Hg, Se, Bi, Ge, Mn and As are somewhere in between these extremes.\nResults of LA-ICP-MS investigation of sulphides from the Cu-Ag Kupferschiefer deposit can be summarized by the following conclusions:\n\n1)\nTrace element signatures are linked to a specific mineralization style (Fig. 11) and therefore assist in petrographic observations in distinguishing separate stages of ore formation.\n\n\n2)\nSulphides adjacent to or surrounded by hematitic \u201cred spot\u201d zones are particularly enriched in some of the redox sensitive elements: djurleite in V, Se, Re, Au, Hg and Tl, chalcopyrite in V, Se, Hg and Tl, while pyrite in Tl.\n\n\n3)\nA clear pattern in Ag concentrations is observed. Results presented on a log scale reveal linear decrease from chalcocite\/djurleite\u00a0>\u00a0bornite\u00a0>\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0>\u00a0sphalerite. It suggests that Ag distribution on a scale of the district could be controlled by redox conditions and might be linked to general zonation of Fe3+-Cu-Pb-Zn-Fe2+ as well as mineral zonation sequence (hematite-chalcocite-bornite-chalcopyrite-galena-sphalerite-pyrite).\n\n\n4)\nA group of epigenetic sulphide-calcite veins crosscutting lithologies and associated with local faults and tectonic zones contains chalcopyrite exceptionally enriched in germanium (up to 4806\u00a0\u00b5g\/g of Ge). The potential of Kupferschiefer Cu-Ag ore in terms of Ge grades and resources could be heavily underestimated.\n\n\n5)\nThe majority of sulphides analysed in the present study do not contain rhenium above detection limits (0.1\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Re), but measurable quantities were found in two types of djurleite. The first one (up to 0.9\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Re) is adjacent to red spots while carbonate hosted djurleite constitutes the second group (up to 3.9\u00a0\u00b5g\/g Re). This suggest that djurleite could be a preferential host for rhenium in the orebody.\n\n\n6)\nComparison with samples from the Nchanga deposit indicate that some of the trace element signatures might be basin specific, as chalcopyrite from the Zambian Copperbelt has much lower contents of Mo, Ag, Sb, Tl, Pb but higher contents of In and Sn.\n\n\n7)\nResults show the great potential of the LA-ICP-MS method in investigating SSC deposits, especially with regards to their critical metal inventory, and emphasize the need for further studies.\n\n\n\n\n","40":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nPorphyry-epithermal systems are important sources of base and precious metals (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003; Sillitoe, 2010). They are subdivided into two main groups, namely deep porphyry copper systems, transitional into shallower porphyry-related base-metal vein and replacement deposits (Henley and Adams, 1992; Hemley and Hunt, 1992; Einaudi et al., 2003; Baumgartner et al., 2008; Sillitoe, 2010; Catchpole et al., 2012), and ultimately near the surface termed high, intermediate, and low-sulfidation epithermal deposits (HS, IS, and LS) (Hedenquist et al., 1998; Muntean and Einaudi, 2001; Einaudi et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2019). The Mesozoic to Cenozoic Alpine-Himalayan Orogenic Belt (Tethyan orogenic belt, TOB), stretching from the Alps, through the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Tibet, Indochina and ultimately into the southwest Pacific, has the best-known concentration of epithermal-porphyry systems (Blundell et al., 2005; Schettino and Turco, 2011; Richards, 2015). Located in the middle of this extensive TOB, Iran hosts many porphyry-epithermal ore mineralized systems along (i) the NW-SE trending Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA) (e.g., Richards, 2015 and references therein), (ii) the E-W trending Alborz Magmatic Arc (AMA) (Shamanian et al., 2004; Mehrabi and Siani, 2012; Tale Fazel et al., 2019), and (iii) the East Iran Magmatic Assemblage (Richards et al., 2012 and references therein). The western Alborz, here known as the Alborz-Azerbaijan Magmatic Belt, is subdivided into the northwestern Ahar-Arasbaran Belt (AAB) and the southeastern Tarom-Hashtjin Metallogenic Province (THMP) (Ghasemi Siani et al., 2015; Fig. 1\n).\nThe THMP is one of the most important epithermal provinces in Iran (Ghasemi Siani et al., 2020 and references therein). The Chomalu epithermal polymetallic deposit is located in 70\u00a0km north of Zanjan province in the THMP. Ancient workings and dumps were found at several locations near hydrothermal vein occurrences. A new exploration program in the Chomalu deposit conducted by the Karend Sadr Jahan Company in Iran with 27 boreholes (totally 4500\u00a0m) and 12 trenches (totally 110\u00a0m), indicates 0.2 Mt of Pb-Zn-Cu-Au-Ag ore with an average grade of 4.7% Pb, 3.2% Zn, 0.5% Cu, 1.08\u00a0g\/t Au, and 60\u00a0g\/t Ag.\nIn this paper, we first summarize the main aspects of mineralogy, mineral chemistry, and fluid inclusions of the mineralized veins, then address some of the key questions related to the evolution of the hydrothermal system, mechanisms of ore deposition and genesis of the Chomalu epithermal deposit. Finally, we compare it with the Cordilleran-type, base-metal veins, and present an overview of tectono-magmatic setting in the western Alborz and associated porphyry-epithermal ore mineralization. Results of this study, combined with published literature on other ore deposits in the THMP (especially Glojeh deposit), are used to define a framework for exploration of the epithermal base-metal veins in the THMP and possibly discovery of buried porphyry ore systems.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Cenozoic Alborz Magmatic Arc (AMA) in the northern part of Iran consists of Eocene to Miocene porphyritic and non-porphyritic, massive lava flows of andesite, basaltic andesite, basalt, and sedimentary rocks composed of both marine and subaerial sequences underlain by the Precambrian metamorphic basement, associated with plutonic intrusions, followed by the Cambrian and Permian metamorphic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks (mainly limestone and sandstone) (Azizi and Jahangiri, 2008).\nThe stratigraphy of the THMP is dominated by Eocene mafic to acidic volcanic rocks and Eocene intrusions overlain by Oligo-Miocene volcano-plutonic and sedimentary rocks (siltstone, sandstone, limestone and etc.). This tectono-magmatic metallogenic region is characterized by numerous epithermal ore systems (Fig. 2\n). The main epithermal ore mineralization are; Chodarchay HS deposit (0.5 Mt; 0.9% Cu and 2\u00a0g\/t Au; Yasami et al., 2017), Glojeh HS to IS deposit (2.3 Mt of 3% Pb, 2.2% Zn, 1.5% Cu, 2.9\u00a0g\/t Au, and 350\u00a0g\/t Ag; Mehrabi et al., 2010, 2016), Khalifehlou HS deposit (60,000\u00a0t; 8% Cu, 6\u00a0g\/t Au, and 7\u00a0g\/t Ag; Esmaeli et al., 2015), Aliabad-Khanchy IS deposit (0.2 Mt with 1.3% Cu; Kouhestani et al., 2018), Shah-Ali-Beiglou IS deposit (3% Zn, 7% Pb, 1.1% Cu, and 24\u00a0g\/t Ag; Mikaeili et al., 2018), Lohneh IS deposit (Zamanian et al., 2016), Nikuyeh LS deposit (Aghajani et al., 2016), Chargar (Mousavi Motlagh and Ghaderi, 2019), and Aqkand LS deposit (Kouhestani et al., 2017). The highly altered Eocene volcanic rocks are the main host rocks of the epithermal ore deposits and mineralization, which are dominantly controlled by the NNE- and NE- and NNW- and NW-trending faults (Ghasemi Siani and Lentz, 2022).\nThe Chomalu epithermal deposit is located in the THMP, close to the well-studied Glojeh epithermal ore deposit. The latter consists of two separately mineralized polymetallic veins, namely North Glojeh and South Glojeh (cf. Mehrabi et al., 2016; Fig. 3\n). The Eocene-Oligocene volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks are widespread in this region, mainly including well layered and dark colored lithic and vitric tuffs, basic tuff with interlayered trachybasalt, trachyandesitic basalt and minor andesitic basalt and rhyolite to rhyodacite. The volcanic rocks are intruded by two granitoid stocks, namely Goljin and Varmarziar intrusions (Ghasemi Siani et al., 2015). Several subvolcanic dikes, characterized by quartz, biotite, and plagioclase phenocrysts, intruded the lithic tuff unit.\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\nAbout 160 surface and drill core samples were collected from mineralized veins and alteration zones during field work. One hundred and twelve polished thin sections were prepared and their textures and mineralogy studied by optical microscopy. Optical microscopy were carried out at the Iranian Mineral Processing Research Center (IMPRC) and Kharazmi University of Tehran using an Axioplan2 Zeiss reflected-transmitted research microscope. In addition, selected polished samples were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM), using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis for mineral identification and later quantitative analysis by electronic probe microanalysis (EPMA).\nSEM studies were carried out by a Zeiss Evo model at Kharazmi University. The SEM-EDS analyses and secondary electron (SEM-SE) images were acquired using beam currents of 0.05 and 5nA and an electron acceleration voltage of 5 to 20\u00a0kV. The EPMA analyses were carried out using a Cameca SX100 instrument mounted with five WDX spectrometers at IMPRC using an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV and 15nA current for silicates. The detection limit is\u00a0\u223c100\u00a0ppm for all elements.\nFifteen powder samples from alteration zones and supergene ore were studied by the XRD method after grinding in an agate mortar and pestle down to\u00a0<60\u00a0\u03bcm diameter. The XRD analyses were performed using a Philips (Xpert-Pro model) instrument with CoK\u03b11 (1.789A\u00b0) primary beam, mono-chromator on secondary optics, 40\u00a0kV power and 35\u00a0mA current at the IMPRC. The mineralogical composition of the samples was determined using quantitative XRD analysis (Rietveld method). Data were collected from 4.0 to 80.0\u00b0 2\u03b8, with a step size of 0.02\u00b0.\nFifteen doubly polished sections of quartz, fluorite, and sphalerite from mineralized veins were prepared for fluid inclusion microthermometry using a Linkam THMS 600 freezing-heating stage, mounted on a ZEISS Axioplan2 research microscope at IMPRC. The precision of the temperature measurements was less than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C for heating and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C for freezing.\n\n\n4\nMineralization style and hydrothermal alteration\nThe exposed strata are mainly andesitic basalt, andesite, trachyandesite, and olivine basalt, with minor rhyolite to dacite, intruded by quartz monzonite, porphyritic quartz monzodiorite, and monzosyenite (Fig. 4\na). The ore bodies are structurally controlled by NNW- to NNE-trending systems (Fig. 5\na), and subdivided in two zones; consisting of several mineralized veins (Fig. 4b). The first mineralized zone is located in the andesitic host rocks close to the quartz monzonite intrusion (Fig. 5a). It is composed of five main E-W-trending polymetallic veins (I, II, III, IV and V) and several accessory veins, in association with hydrothermal breccias and silica-carbonate open space fillings (Fig. 5b, c). Total length of the veins is 800\u00a0m with 2 to 20\u00a0m width (average of 6\u00a0m). They developed directly on the main fault, N70E with dip 75\u201380\u00b0 to the SE, and experienced cataclastic deformation due to post mineralization fault reactivation. Silicification is the main alteration in these ore vein systems, surrounded by sericitic alteration.\nThe second mineralized zone, located farther north (Fig. 4b), contains of five ore veins, namely, V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5, mostly hosted by the olivine basalts. These veins, with a total length of 950\u00a0m and 4\u00a0m width in average, are orientated NNW (N10-35\u00a0W) with a dip of 60\u201370\u00b0 NE. They are characterized by base-metal mineralization with intensively silicic, sericitic, argillic and propylitic alteration zones.\nA variety of primary ore textures has been identified, including veins, veinlets, massive, crustiform banding, colloform, hydrothermal breccia, stockwork, and disseminated textures (Fig. 5d\u2013f). The first mineralized zone is Cu-Au rich, whereas the second mineralized zone is rich in Ag-Pb-Zn. It is evident that from east to west, in the first mineralized zone and south to north in the second mineralized zone, there is an increasing order of Zn\u00a0>\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Ag\u00a0>\u00a0Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Au content. Ore minerals in both ore bodies are dominated by pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, magnetite, sphalerite, galena and tetrahedrite, siderite, smithsonite, rhodochrosite, magnesite, oligonite, hemimorphite, chalcocite, cerussite, covellite, malachite, hematite, and goethite. Quartz, fluorite, and calcite are the main gangue minerals.\nHydrothermal alteration in the mining area is intense and developed as envelopes around the veins in a range of one to tens of meters, consisting of silicification and argillization, followed by sericitization and propylitization. Silicification is the main alteration and is characterized by massive and vuggy silica, quartz, chalcedony and anatase associated with disseminated pyrite (Fig. 6\nai, aii). Vuggy quartz is more common with Au-Cu mineralization in the first mineralized zone, whereas massive quartz is dominant with galena and sphalerite veins. Sericitization is less intense and represented by sericite, quartz, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and minor calcite in which plagioclase phenocrysts are partly replaced by sericite (Fig. 6bi, bii). Argillic alteration is well-developed around the base-metal veins and mainly characterized by quartz, kaolinite, and illite, and less common montmorillonite, chlorite, and pyrite, with plagioclase and K-feldspar replaced completely by kaolinite and illite (Fig. 6ci, cii). Propylitic alteration in the outer alteration zone consists of calcite, epidote, chlorite, and albite (Fig. 6di, dii). Farther out at the regional scale, beyond the mineralized zones of the Chomalu ore mining district, supergene alteration includes widespread acid-sulfate supergene alunite, jarosite, and gypsum.\n\n\n5\nParagenetic succession and mineral chemistry\nAlthough the mineral assemblages are similar in both ore bodies, there is a weak zonation in the base-metal assemblages (Fig. 4b). The internal part contains pyrite, chalcopyrite, and magnetite with minor bornite, whereas the external part contains more sphalerite, galena, quartz, and fluorite. Fig. 7\n shows a paragenetic sequence of ore and gangue minerals in the Chomalu ore deposit.\nAccording to field observations, cross-cutting relationships and mineral assemblages, the ore-forming processes can be subdivided into three stages: 1) an early Cu-Au-As-Fe stage, 2) the main ore stage divided into Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag-rich minerals (I), Pb-Zn-rich minerals (II) and late Fe-Mn-Zn-Ca-Mg carbonates (III), and finally 3) late supergene weathering stage. The early stage is characterized by vuggy quartz and silica-carbonate veins containing disseminated pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, and magnetite (Fig. 8\na). Magnetite formed as anhedral and locally subhedral crystals and contains pyrite inclusions, with an almost homogeneous composition. Pyrite occurs as euhedral to anhedral, massive and disseminated crystals, and shows late overgrowths with arsenian pyrite (Fig. 8b). Three points analyses of pyrite indicate that its composition is almost constant, with 46.31% to 46.57\u00a0wt% Fe and traces of arsenic (0.02 to 0.15\u00a0wt%) (Table 1\n). Overgrowths on pyrite have more arsenic (up to 0.45\u00a0wt%) and gold content in pyrite is low (0.01\u00a0wt%). We cannot identify the host minerals for gold mineralization, although results of chemical analysis indicate that some samples from these veins have up to 3\u00a0ppm (g\/t) Au. Chalcopyrite and minor bornite usually occur in association with pyrite and replace the pyrite along fractures, indicating a later formation. Chalcopyrite contains 0.01\u20130.04\u00a0wt% As. Quartz and calcite are the main gangue minerals of this stage.\nThe main ore-stage zones show a well-developed lateral and vertical zoning. Quartz and fluorite are major gangue minerals in the main stage. Three episodes of quartz deposition are recognized including crustiform and massive quartz, massive quartz-fluorite, and vein\/veinlets containing base-metal sulfides and then barren fine smoky quartz vein.\nThe most internal part (I) consists of veinlets and massive ore of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, and tetrahedrite, associated with Ag-bearing minerals, and with kaolinite and illite alteration minerals; termed as the Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag zone (Fig. 5g). Sub-stage I is characterized by deposition of coarse-grained quartz, galena, and sphalerite in form of massive, veins and veinlets. Galena and sphalerite are main minerals formed as intergrowths though some inclusion of galena observed in sphalerite and vice versa (Fig. 8c, Fig. 9a). Ag-bearing tetrahedrite inclusions are abundant in both galena and sphalerite (Fig. 8d, Fig. 9b), and there are also chalcopyrite inclusions in tetrahedrite, galena, and sphalerite (Fig. 8e, Fig. 9c). Pyrite also occurs a inclusions in sphalerite (Fig. 9\nd). These observations indicate that ore assemblages formed simultaneously. We cannot detect any silver minerals by EPMA and just covellite in the late supergene stage formed around galena contains up to 5\u00a0wt% Ag (Table 1). The iron and cadmium contents of sphalerite are generally low (0.12\u20130.92\u00a0wt% and 0.01\u20131.97\u00a0wt%, respectively). Chalcopyrite inclusions in galena and sphalerite are close to stoichiometric chemical compositions. Due to supergene alteration cerussite formed in galena rims. Since the Cu content in the galena are noticeable and inclusions of Ag-bearing minerals, like tetrahedrite presence in the galena, Ag-rich covellite (up to 5\u00a0wt% Ag), and Ag-bearing cerussite (up to 2\u00a0wt% Ag) formed within the galena (Fig. 8f, Fig. 9e). These supergene alterations locally reach down to a depth of 70\u00a0m below the surface, and produced Ag- and Pb-rich oxidized ores around sub-stages I and II. Galena tends to contain 0.02 to 0.08\u00a0wt% As, 0.01 to 0.34\u00a0wt% Bi, below detection limit to 0.55\u00a0wt% Cd, 0.01 to 0.09\u00a0wt% Ag, and 0.15 to 8.99\u00a0wt% Cu. The tetrahedrite is rich in copper (averages 36.86\u00a0wt%) and zinc (6.85 to 7.49\u00a0wt%) with Ag contents of 0.47 to 2.37\u00a0wt%.\nZone I is succeeded outward to zone (II), which is massive to crustiform ores containing galena and sphalerite without tetrahedrite and Ag-bearing minerals, referred as the sphalerite-galena zone (Fig. 5h). Sub-stage II is characterized by massive and open space filling textures in association with medium- to coarse-grained quartz and fluorite, and coarse-grained sphalerite and galena (Fig. 8g and h). Iron content in sphalerite is low (0.41 to 0.83\u00a0wt%). The composition of galena is close to stoichiometric (Bi content is 0.31 to 0.63\u00a0wt% and Te content is 0.01 to 0.12\u00a0wt%).\nZone (III) includes Zn-Mn-Fe-bearing carbonates, referred as Zn-bearing carbonate zone, depicted as a relatively homogeneous thin halo which almost completely surrounding the sphalerite-galena zone (Fig. 5I and j). In contrast to the other zones, sub-stage (III) is virtually devoid of sulfides, consisting siderite, smithsonite, rhodochrosite, magnesite, oligonite, and hemimorphite (Fig. 8i, Fig. 9f) and some unnamed carbonate as well. They occur in patches and massive zones, <15\u00a0m long and 2\u00a0m thick, with grades commonly in the range of 1 to 4\u00a0wt% Zn.\nThere is no sharp boundary between sub-stages I and II. Some samples display galena and sphalerite zone accompanied by Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag, suggesting that the transition between these sub-stages of main ore stage was gradual. On the other hand, there is a sharp boundary between sulfide zones (Sub-stages I and II) and non-sulfide zones (III). The increasing abundance of sphalerite relative to galena with increasing distance from the Cu-bearing zones is a remarkable feature of the main ore stage. In general, in parts of the main ore stage galena predominates over sphalerite, which is also distinguished by up to 150\u00a0g\/t Ag; we presume that, except for tetrahedrite inclusions, there may be fine-grained Ag-bearing minerals as inclusions of the main silver sulfides (likely argentite and acanthite) in galena.\n\n\n6\nFluid inclusions\nFluid inclusion assemblages (FIAs) have been studied in quartz from the early stage (Qtz1), main stage including sub-stage I (Qtz2), and sub-stage II (Qtz3), sphalerite from sub-stage I (Sp1) and sub-stage II (Sp2) and fluorite from sub-stage II (Fl) (Table 2\n). Both primary and secondary fluid inclusions are recognized in the Chomalu deposit. Secondary fluid inclusions occur along fracture planes and represent fluids trapped after host-mineral precipitation. Based on Roedder (1994), microthermometric measurements were carried out on the same fluid inclusion assemblages occurring in a primary single phase and evident growth zones. Only liquid-rich (L\u00a0+\u00a0V) type of fluid inclusions was identified based on their phases at room temperature (21\u00a0\u00b0C) (Roedder, 1984). They occur in the early stage and in the main stage (I and II) of mineralization, mainly as isolated individuals or locally in clusters. There was no evidence of daughter minerals, CO2 and CH4 in the fluid inclusions.\n\n6.1\nEarly stage\nPrimary fluid inclusions in quartz samples (Qtz1) from the early stage, contain 20\u201330\u00a0vol% vapor, 6 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm size with elliptical, and rounded and irregular shapes (Fig. 10\na). A total of fourteen primary fluid inclusions were studied in Qtz1, yield ice-melting temperatures (Tm-ice) of \u22122.9\u00b0 to \u22122.0\u00a0\u00b0C, with corresponding salinities of 3.5 to 4.82\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent based on Bodnar (1993) (Fig. 11\n). These FIAs have homogenization temperatures of 253\u00b0 to 305\u00a0\u00b0C with an average of 275\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 11).\n\n\n6.2\nMain stage (sub-stage I)\nFluid inclusions in Qtz2 from base-metal ore are small (4\u201322\u00a0\u03bcm, mainly 8 to 12\u00a0\u03bcm; Fig. 10b), whereas in sphalerite from the base-metal ore (Sp1) are in range of 8 to 32\u00a0\u03bcm with a major clustering between 15 and 20\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 10c). They have elliptical, negative crystal, elongate and irregular shapes and contain 20 to 30 and 10 to 30\u00a0vol% vapor in Qtz2 and Sp1, respectively. Primary fluid inclusions in Qtz2 (total of 11 primary fluid inclusion) yield Tm-ice values in range of \u22122.8\u00b0 to \u22121.2\u00a0\u00b0C, salinities of 2.18 to 4.65\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent based on Bodnar (1993) (Fig. 11). These FIAs were completely homogenize to liquid phase at homogenization temperatures of 220\u00b0 to 280\u00a0\u00b0C (average 250\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 11). A total of 13 primary fluid inclusions were studied in Sp1, yield ice-melting temperatures (Tm-ice) of \u22123\u00b0 to \u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C, with corresponding salinities of 3.12 to 4.96\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent based on Bodnar (1993), and homogenization temperatures of 200\u00b0 to 237\u00a0\u00b0C with an average of 225\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 11).\n\n\n6.3\nMain stage (sub-stage II)\nFluid inclusion in Qtz3 FIAs from sub-stage II have elliptical, rounded and irregular shapes in range of 5\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm, with 10\u201325\u00a0vol% vapor (Fig. 10d). Salinities estimated for primary Qtz3 FIAs (a total of 7 fluid inclusion) are from 2.05 to 2.50\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent (corresponding with Tm-ice of \u22121.4\u00b0 to \u22121.1\u00a0\u00b0C) based on Bodnar (1993). Homogenization temperatures (Th) of Qtz3 FIAs are 180\u00b0 to 230\u00a0\u00b0C (average 210\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 11). Fluid inclusions in Fl from sub-stage II, have elliptical and rounded shapes of 9\u201336\u00a0\u03bcm in size, contain 10\u201325\u00a0vol% vapor (Fig. 10e). A total of 52 primary fluid inclusions were studied in Fl, yield ice-melting temperatures (Tm-ice) of \u22121.7\u00b0 to \u22120.3\u00a0\u00b0C, with corresponding salinities of 0.53 to 2.90\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent based on Bodnar (1993) (Fig. 11). These FIAs have homogenization temperatures of 187\u00b0 to 229\u00a0\u00b0C with an average of 216\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 11). Primary FIAs from Sp2, composed of 10\u201340\u00a0vol% vapor phase of 10\u2013107\u00a0\u03bcm size, mainly appear as elliptical, rounded, irregular and negative crystal shapes (Fig. 10f). Salinities estimated for primary Sp2 FIAs (a total of 15 fluid inclusion) are 1.74 to 2.57\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent (corresponding with Tm-ice of \u22121.5\u00b0 to \u22121\u00a0\u00b0C) with homogenization temperatures (Th) 183\u00b0 to 235\u00a0\u00b0C (average 211\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 11).\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nMineralization and fluid evolution\nAt Chomalu, fluid inclusions show that the early stage of mineralization formed over a range from 305\u00b0 down to 253\u00a0\u00b0C with salinities between 4.8 down to 3.5\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent. The subsequent main ore stage was characterized by generally lower homogenization temperatures of 200\u00b0 to 280\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00b0 to 235\u00a0\u00b0C with salinities of 2.18 to 4.96 and 0.53 to 2.90\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent for sub-stages I and II, respectively. As noted before, there is no evidence for boiling, such as the coexistence of vapor and liquid dominated phase and also the absence of adularia and bladed calcite, as a main mechanism for gold and other ore precipitation (Simmons and Christenson, 1994; Simmons and Browne, 2000). Rapid cooling shown by the FIAs of each mineral generation, especially the main stage sphalerite, fluorite, and chalcedony in silicified veins, is the main trigger for ore precipitation. Precipitation of chalcedony can, however, be a product of rapid cooling possibly caused by boiling (Jiang et al., 2004).\nThe fluid evolution diagram, represented by homogenization temperature vs. salinity (Fig. 12\n; Wilkinson, 2001), suggests two main evolution stages with overlapping conditions. The main mechanism for ore precipitation at Chomalu was simultaneous dilution and cooling with oxidation state change (possibly accompanied by an increase in pH) by mixing a cold water (probably modified meteoric water) with hydrothermal fluid. Temperature decrease is one of the most commonly suspected processes leading to sulfide precipitation (Reed and Palandri, 2006; Fontbot\u00e9 et al., 2017). However, we conclude that simple temperature decrease is not the only mechanism initiating sulfide saturation with a temperature decrease resulting in dilution associated with cooling of hydrothermal fluid. In the early stage, Cu and possible Au (as electrum) precipitate close to intrusion at higher temperature of 305\u00b0 decreasing to 253\u00a0\u00b0C and salinities of 4.8 decreasing to 3.5\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent. The vast majority of metal precipitation (galena and sphalerite) results from greater dilution and cooling in the main stage (sub-stage I), which moves Ag from electrum to possibly argentite (see Reed and Palandri, 2006). Mineral assemblages (Zn-Mn-Fe-bearing carbonates) indicate changing redox from reduced in the early stage and sub-stages I and II to moderately oxidized conditions in the sub-stage III. In a Th vs. salinity diagram Roedder (1984), fluid inclusion data plot in the field of epithermal mineralization close to the magmatic fluid field with 0.78 to 0.93\u00a0g\/cm3 density (Fig. 12). The first ice melting in all of the inclusions begins at temperatures of\u00a0\u221229.5\u00b0 up to\u00a0\u221221.2\u00b0 C (average\u00a0\u221223.5\u00b0 C), implying the dominance of the NaCl\u2013H2O system during mineralization. Due to an insignificant role of boiling at Chomalu, for pressure corrections we assume an average thickness of the volcanic rocks of 800\u00a0m, which is equal to 200\u00a0bar. Correction at 200\u00a0bar, based on Bodnar (1993) and Steele-MacInnis et al. (2012), adds up to 10\u201312\u00a0\u00b0C to the corresponding measured Th as the best estimate of trapping temperatures. Therefore, the depth of formation of mineralization at Chomalu probably was 300 to 700\u00a0m below the paleosurface, consistent with IS deposits found within vertical intervals generally of 300\u2013800\u00a0m (e.g., Hedenquist et al., 2000; Albinson and Nelson, 2001; Echavarria et al., 2006).\n\n\n7.2\nGenesis and ore deposition model\nPorphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposits, polymetallic epithermal deposits, Cu, Cu-Fe, Au, and Zn-Pb skarn deposits, Cordilleran polymetallic veins and replacement bodies, and distal Au deposits form in magmatic-hydrothermal systems in association with magmatic arcs (Henley and Berger, 2013; Pirajno, 2015). Polymetallic epithermal deposits form at less than \u223c1.5\u00a0km depth and temperatures range of 150\u00b0 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g., Hedenquist et al., 2000; Simmons et al., 2005), and are subdivided into HS, IS, and LS types. Features and characterization of these epithermal types are discussed comprehensively in the literature (e.g., White and Hedenquist, 1990; Einaudi et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2019). In this section, we compare the most significant features of the deposit, such as ore and gangue mineralogy, ore texture, tectonic settings, relation to magmatism and the sulfidation state of epithermal deposits, then we present a schematic and simplified scenario for ore deposition in the Chomalu deposit.\nEnargite-luzonite-famatinite-covellite mineral assemblages, high content of sulfides (10\u201390\u00a0vol%), quartz-alunite, quartz-pyrophyllite, and quartz-dickite alteration mineral assemblages and barite as the main gangue mineral in the absence of carbonate, are key features of the HS type, whereas abundant arsenopyrite, low sulfides content (typically\u00a0<2\u00a0vol%), minor pyrite, chalcedony-quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0fluorite as primary gangue minerals, and illite\/smectite-adularia as alteration minerals are key features of the LS type. Mineral assemblages in the Chomalu ore veins is relatively simple, including pyrite, arsenopyrite, Fe-poor sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, bornite, tetrahedrite, and Zn-Mn-Fe carbonate mineral are similar to the majority of IS deposits (Einaudi et al., 2003; Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003; Wang et al., 2019). The gangue minerals in IS deposits are typically quartz, Mn-carbonates, commonly rhodochrosite and manganoan calcite, and fluorite (Wang et al., 2019 and references therein). Quartz, fluorite, rhodochrosite, and calcite are the main gangue minerals in the Chomalu deposit. Hydrothermal alteration at Chomalu included intensive silicification in the first mineralized zone associated with minor sericitization and intensive argillization (kaolinite and illite) and propylitization in the second mineralized zone.\nKey features in the Chomalu deposit are: 1) pyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, minor arsenopyrite and abundant Zn-Mn-Fe carbonate minerals; 2) high content of silver and base metals with high silver to gold ratios (50\u201360); 3) a sulfide content of\u00a0\u223c40\u00a0vol% in the veins; 4) proximal sericite alteration and distal kaolinite and illite alteration (adularia absence), and 5) presence of crustiform banding, vuggy and veins and brecciated bodies. These features suggest that the Choumalu is an IS epithermal deposit (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003; Wang et al., 2019).\nThe weak zonation, characterized by the formation of Cu-Au-Fe mineral assemblages in the first mineralized zone, followed by an increase in Pb-Zn\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Ag toward west and north, and finally precipitation of Zn-Fe-Mn carbonate in the northern part of the district, indicates that the early fluid that formed Cu-Au-Fe assemblages possibly originated from the intrusion and then migrated outward into the volcanic complex. In the first mineralized zone fluids formed E-W trending veins along a major fault in the host andesites. As they flowed upward and encountered several subordinate faults (mainly NW-SE faults), the second mineralized zone formed, roughly parallel to the faults. Fluid of the main ore-stage overprinted the early-stage ore and continued to flow to the north and west. Einaudi et al. (2003) present a diagram for the sulfidation state of sulfides as a function of high fS2 and intermediate to low fO2 and temperature (1000\/T) showing that IS type sulfidation is stable with respect to chalcopyrite-pyrite-argentite, as well as tennantite and tetrahedrite. The Chomalu ore assemblages trace slight fluctuations in terms of sulfidation state (Fig. 13\n). The FeS content in sphalerite increases slightly from 0.12 to 0.92\u00a0wt% (average 0.40\u00a0wt%) in sub-stage I to 0.41\u20130.83\u00a0wt% (average 0.60\u00a0wt%) in sub-stage II, implying a slight decrease in sulfidation state accompanied by an increase in pH. The latter is indicated by sericite and vuggy quartz deposition in the early stage and increasing argillic alteration with kaolinite and illite in sub-stage I and II, and finally siderite and other carbonate minerals in the sub-stage III. Widespread precipitation of Zn-Fe-Mn carbonate in the outer sphalerite-galena zone may indicates an increase in oxidation state.\nIn terms of tectonic settings and age of mineralization, these IS deposits can develop in all stress regimes (compressive, neutral, and extensional) in magmatic arcs (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003), back arcs (Camprub\u00ed and Albinson, 2007), and post-collisional orogenic belt (Xie et al., 2017). They are mainly of Cenozoic age with a distinct peak in the Miocene (Wang et al., 2019). IS type deposits are commonly hosted by andesitic volcanic rocks, which may be comagmatic with the causative porphyry intrusion. The Chomalu deposit formed in the Eocene extensional setting within andesite to olivine basalt host, and fluid inclusions microthermometry indicates that hydrothermal fluids made a contribution to the ore mineralization. In addition, intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposits are divided into two sub-classes, namely Neutral-Compressional IS (NC-type IS) and Extensional IS (E-type IS) (refer to Wang et al., 2019 for more details). Western Alborz Magmatic Arc and Alborz-Azerbaijan Magmatic Belt are considered as an extensional back-arc tectonic setting (Fig. 14\na; Shafaii Moghadam et al., 2020; Ghasemi Siani et al., 2020). The Chomalu deposit formed in an extensional setting with Ag-Pb-Zn and high Ag\/Au metal (50\u201360) associations and is therefore considered as an E-type IS deposit. A generalized model for mineralization in the Chomalu deposit shows that at 39 to 40\u00a0Ma (unpublished U-Pb age and Ar-Ar ages by Ghasemi Siani et al., 2015); the intrusive center acted as the heat engine and source of hydrothermal fluid in close vicinity of the mineralized zones. Unfortunately, we cannot directly verify the timing of mineralization due to the absence of good representative sericite. After intrusion, exsolving magmatic hydrothermal fluids extracted Cl, S, Au, and Ag from sulfides and the silicate melt, developing a saline ore-bearing fluid system (H2O-NaCl), enriched in metals and sulfur as chloride and bisulfide complexes (refer to Zhu et al., 2011). The released metal-bearing hydrothermal fluid migrated upwards and laterally to the north and west, and after extracting more metals, such as Pb and Zn from volcanic rocks, mixed with meteoric water, causing a rapid decrease in temperature and resulting in ore precipitation as open space (faults) filling (Fig. 14b).\n\n\n7.3\nComparison with Cordilleran ore types and future exploration guide\nPolymetallic epithermal ore deposits were initially classified as Cordilleran vein-type deposits formed in veins or lodes in porphyry-related systems (Bendez\u00fa and Fontbot\u00e9, 2002; Bendez et al., 2003; Bendezu and Fontbote, 2009; Fontbot\u00e9 et al., 2009). Einaudi (1982), Bendez\u00fa et al. (2008), and Baumgartner et al. (2008) use the term polymetallic\\base -metal epithermal deposits. This type of mineralization has also been termed \u201czoned base-metal veins\u201d by Einaudi et al. (2003), but a clear zonation is not always recognizable. Some key features of Cordilleran base-metal deposits include (modified after Bendezu et al., 2008; Bendezu and Fontbote, 2009): 1) close association in time and space with calc-alkaline igneous activity, i.e. same environment as most porphyry Cu and HS epithermal Au\u2013Ag deposits; 2) precipitation mostly under epithermal conditions at temperatures\u00a0<375\u00a0\u00b0C and moderate to low salinity (e.g., Kouzmanov et al., 2004; Prendergast et al., 2005; Bendez\u00fa, 2007; Baumgartner et al., 2008; Catchpole et al., 2009; Rusk et al., 2008; Catchpole et al., 2011); 3) sulfides rich base-metal veins (up to more than 50\u00a0wt% total sulfides); 4) mostly well-developed zoning of ore and alteration minerals with HS (advanced argillic alteration assemblages) in the core followed by an early pyrite\u2013quartz stages that can be extensive and form large zoned bodies outwardly as Zn\u2013Pb ores; 5) mainly as open-space fillings (veins, breccia bodies) in silicate host rocks and as replacement in carbonate rocks; and 6) higher Ag\/Au ratios than HS epithermal Au\u2013(Ag) mineralization. Cordilleran ore deposits are also subdivided into strongly zoned and weakly zoned deposits. Strongly zoned deposits like Smelter-Colquijirca (Baumgartner et al., 2008; Bendezu and Fontbote, 2009) are characterized by enargite, pyrite, quartz \u00b1 (tennantite, wolframite, chalcopyrite, covellite, chalcocite, alunite, dickite, kaolinite) in the internal sector and sphalerite, galena \u00b1 (sericite, kaolinite, dickite, hematite, Mn-Fe carbonates) in the external part, whereas in the weakly zoned deposits (such as Domo de Yauli, Beuchat et al., 2004; Cerro de Pasco, Baumgartner et al., 2008; Morococha, Catchpole, 2011; Catchpole et al., 2012; Catchpole et al., 2015), pyrrhotite, pyrite, quartz \u00b1 (chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite, carbonates, sericite, chlorite) form in internal part, whereas external zones are characterized by sphalerite, galena, and pyrrhotite \u00b1 (Mn-Fe carbonates, sericite, chlorite, quartz).\nMany of the Cordilleran ore deposits features are present in the Chomalu epithermal system, for example 1) the Chomalu deposit formed close the Varmarziar high-K, I-type intrusion; 2) presence of Cu porphyry in Rashtabad and Chodarchay indicates (Yasami et al., 2017) a possible association of porphyry-epithermal ore systems in the THMP; 3) low to moderate homogenization temperatures of 187\u00b0 to 305\u00a0\u00b0C and low to moderate salinities of 0.53 to 4.96\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent; and 4) high sulfide content (40 %) and high Ag\/Au (50\u201360). As noted above, the geometry, mineralogical patterns, and paragenetic sequence of the orebodies at Chomalu are consistent with the weakly zoned Cordilleran system. The early stage, with sericite reflecting acidic conditions and the assemblage of pyrite, quartz, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and bornite, is comparable to the internal sector of weakly zoned base-metal deposits, whereas external parts of the main stage, characterized by kaolinite and illite associated with sphalerite, galena and Zn-Mn-Fe carbonates, are consistent with external part of the weakly zoned Cordilleran system. On the regional scale, the Glojeh deposit, located in the west of the Chomalu deposit, has an internal part with enargite, famatinite, chalcocite, covellite, bournonite, chalcopyrite, bornite, and pyrite assemblages implying HS state, and margins with Ag-rich sphalerite-galena bodies suggesting an IS state, these features are consistent with strongly zoned base-metal deposits (Cordilleran type ore vein).\nPresence of both strongly and weakly zoned Cordilleran-type ore veins indicate that mineralizing fluids were strongly fluctuating in pH and sulfidation states from high sulfidation states in the central part of north Glojeh vein to intermediate sulfidation state in the periphery area (south Glojeh and Chomalu), which depend on temperature and spatial path followed by the ore-forming fluids and their interaction with the host rocks (e.g., Baumgartner et al., 2008). Although our previous research indicates that extensional back-arc magmatic activity of the THMP is less prospective for porphyry deposits, although there is evidence of porphyry mineralization in the Chodarchay (Yasami et al., 2017) and Glojeh deposits (Mehrabi et al., 2016), as well as similarities between these deposits with Cordilleran-type ore veins suggesting that it is possible to find porphyry deposits in the THMP.\n\n\n\n8\nConcluding remarks\nThe Chomalu polymetallic epithermal deposit is located in the THMP, close to the Varmarziar high-K, I-type granitic batholith. Ore mineralization in the Chomalu veins consist of early Au-Cu, followed by Ag-Pb-Zn and finally Zn-Mn-Fe carbonate assemblages. A supergene stage can be found near surface. Metal sulfide precipitation is driven largely by the temperature decrease and concomitant destabilizing chloride-metal complexes, which was caused by dilution and cooling of ore-bearing fluids. The Chomalu polymetallic epithermal deposit is classified as an IS epithermal deposit formed in an extensional back-arc tectonic setting associated with high-K alkalic I-type plutonism, which is comparable with weakly zoned Cordilleran-type epithermal polymetallic mineralization. Due to occurrences of both weakly and strongly zoned Cordilleran-type epithermal in the same area, and development of numerous epithermal ore deposits, THMP can be considered as major target area for further exploration of silver-rich epithermal deposits and possibly porphyry Cu-Mo deposits.\n\n","41":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGeochemical exploration, with the analysis of the fine fraction of stream sediments, is a common tool for prospecting ore deposits. To create maps used in Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM), sundry techniques have been employed to analyze and interpret regional geochemical exploration data (Carranza and Hale, 1997; Carranza, 2008, 2010; Yousefi et al., 2012; Yousefi and Carranza, 2016, 2017; Echogdali et al., 2021; Behera and Panigrahi, 2021). The sample catchment basins (SCB) are a widely used technique for processing and analyzing stream-sediment geochemical data (Yousefi et al., 2013; Shahrestani and Mokhtari, 2017a,b; Shahrestani et al., 2018). This is an implicitly based concept of metal regionalism (Routhier, 1980), which on the one hand states that elements appear in a regional setting more or less close to the deposits, yet on the other hand, each analyzed sample is representative of the composition of the watershed and provides information on the sources of upstream geochemical anomalies (Fletcher, 1997; Adiotomre, 2014).\nTo recognize geochemical signatures related to a particular type of the explored deposit, a factor analysis (as a multivariate analysis method) has been used (e.g., Sanford et al., 1993; Reimann et al., 2002; Kumru and Bakac, 2003; Van Helvoort et al., 2005; El-Makky, 2011; He et al., 2013; Sadeghi et al., 2015; Seyedrahimi-Niaraq and Mahdiyanfar, 2021). Many papers have addressed a wide array of their importance which lies in extracting the primary factors in action to better illustrate multivariate data (Treiblmaier and Filzmoser, 2010; Yousefi et al., 2012, 2014). Staged factor analysis (SFA) allows for reducing variables (elements) and identifying paragenetic items in different factors (Yousefi et al., 2014). Yousefi et al. (2014) improved the transformation of factor scores obtained by SFA into a logistic space for the calculation of the Geochemical Mineralization Prospectivity Index (GMPI) (see Section 3.2.3). This approach transforms a data set into a [0,1] range based on the minimum and maximum values of the data and the slope variations between them (e.g., Carranza and Hale,1997; Porwal et al., 2003; Carranza, 2008; Yousefi et al., 2012; Helba et al., 2021; Echogdali et al., 2021). Consequently, demarcating the distribution of GMPI anomalies can be used as a fuzzy evidence layer for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM).\nIn contrast, the fine fraction of stream sediments is strongly influenced by the complexity of geological, topographic, and geomorphological processes (He et al., 2013; Luz et al., 2014); consequently, the obtained geochemical anomalies exhibit complex spatial patterns (Carranza and Hale, 1997; Spadoni et al., 2005; Cheng, 2007; Zuo et al., 2009). In this regard, fractal\/multifractal models (Mandelbrot, 1983) can be used as geometric support to study the spatial characteristics of geochemical anomalies related to mineralization (Cheng et al., 1994; Cheng, 2007; Carranza, 2008; Afzal et al., 2010; Zuo, 2011). Cheng et al. (1994) proposed the concentration-area (C-A) model for representing complex spatial patterns and separation of geochemichal anomalies. Yousefi and Carranza (2015c) proposed the prediction-area (P-A) plot as an effective technique to evaluate exploration models. Thereafter, these two methods were used by several researchers to create classified models that describe the spatial distribution of geochemical anomalies and detection of targets for prospecting new metal deposits (Albanese et al., 2007, 2015; Behera and Panigrahi, 2021; Carranza, 2008, 2009; Cheng et al., 1994; Cheng and Agterberg, 2009; Deng et al., 2010; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015a,b; Echogdali et al., 2021; Thiombane et al., 2018).\nIn this paper, we use the geochemical survey of the Igherm area to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-fractal modeling based on the SCB method to optimize the selection of tactical exploration areas. This survey covers an area of 2098\u00a0km2 between \u22127\u00b059\u203202\u2032\u2019 to 8\u00b030\u203209\u2032\u2019 longitude and 29\u00b013\u203242 to 30\u00b009\u203231\u2032\u2019 latitude and includes 300 sample sites. After transforming the raw data by SFA, we applied the GMPI function to the obtained factors. A C-A and P-A, aided by comprehensive and large data sets, were then applied to the copper element to separate significant geochemical anomalies related to the copper mineralization of those engendered by the regional geochemical background.\nThe Igherm area, the target of this approach, is part of one of the essential copper-bearing districts of the Anti-Atlas, the Igherm ridge (Bouchta et al., 1977) (Fig. 1\n). Although the number of deposits in operation or under development in this district is significant (Ouinssimi, Agoujgal, Tazalaght, Tizert), the whole area is insufficiently exploited.\n\n\n2\nStudy area characteristics\nMorocco, located at the northwestern end of Africa, shows a very contrasting geomorphology (Fig. 1a) particularly in the shape and grandeur of the landforms, shaped by different orogenic phases over geological time (e.g. Dill et al., 2019, 2020, 2021; Dill, 2022). The course of these geological phenomena coupled with variable climatic conditions from one region to another, resulted in distinct geographical regions (Michard, 1976; Piqu\u00e9 et al., 1989) globally-oriented WSW-ENE: Rif, Meseta, Middle Atlas, High Atlas, Anti-Atlas, and Saharan domain.\nBased on this division, the Anti-Atlas is considered as a vast NE-SW anticlinal bulge formed by Precambrian terrains that outcrop in the form of buttonholes under a late Precambrian to Paleozoic sedimentary cover (Fig. 1b). Geographically, it is subdivided into three areas: The Western Anti-Atlas which extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Siroua massif, the Central Anti-Atlas which extends to the Ouarzazate region and the Eastern Anti-Atlas which extends to the Tafilalet. The area covered by this work is straddling the buttonholes of Igherm, Tanguerfa-Wawfengha, and Agadir-Melloul in the Western Anti-Atlas (Fig. 2\n). The morphology of the latter is characterized by a flattening surface at about 1500\u00a0m, in the limestones and dolomites of the Lower Cambrian (Soulaimani, 1998), molding the bulge of Precambrian bottom that culminates at Jbel Aklim (2531\u00a0m) east of Igherm (Oudra, 1988).\n\n2.1\nGeology\nThe Anti-Atlas is a mountain chain that forms a vast anticlinal bulge-oriented ENE-WSW at the northern edge of the West African Craton (WAC) (Fig. 1). It consists of a Proterozoic basement exposed as buttonholes under a late Precambrian to Paleozoic sedimentary cover. The study area in Igherm is located between the inliers of Igherm Tangarfa-Wawfengha and Agadir-Melloul (Fig. 2).\nIn this study area, the Paleoproterozoic basement comprises schists, micaschists, gneisses, and migmatites (Choubert, 1963; Choubert and Faure Muret, 1973, 1976; Hassenforder, 1987) deformed during the Eburnian orogeny and subsequently by the Pan-African orogeny (Ennih and Li\u00e9geois, 2001). These rocks are intruded by two generations of granitoids with U-Pb zircon ages of around 2000\u00a0Ma (Walsh et al., 2002) and 1750\u00a0Ma (Lama et al., 1993). Several suites of basic dykes intrude the basement rocks in the region and were dated between 2.03 and 1.35\u00a0Ga (A\u00eft Malek et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 2002; Gasquet et al., 2004; Barbey et al., 2004; El Bahat et al., 2013; Kouyat\u00e9 et al., 2013; Ikenne et al., 2017), testifying to extensive tectonic episodes (e.g., Saquaque et al.,1989).\nThe Neoproterozoic unit comprises three groups; the first is the Cryogenian \u201cOurty Group\u201d corresponding to a complex of limestones and bedded quartzites, with which are associated veins and dykes of basic rocks (gabbros and dolerites) (Jeannette and Piqu\u00e9, 1981; Oudra, 1988; Hafid, 1992; El Aouli et al., 2001) and were correlated to Anti-Atlas paleosuture (Leblanc, 1975), at around 800\u00a0Ma (Clauer, 1974). The second is the Lower Ediacaran \u201cIgherm Group\u201d composed of conglomerates, pelites, sandstones, acid, and basic volcanic (Oudra et al., 2005), and the third is represented by the Upper Ediacaran \u201cOuarzazate Group\u201d formed by conglomerates, sandstones and volcanic levels surmounted by pelites and volcanic breccias of different nature: rhyolitic, andesitic or dacitic. Calc-alkaline, calc-alkaline potassic, and alkaline granitoids are associated with the last two groups. The major phase of the Pan-African orogeny that structured the first set is dated at 685\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0Ma (Rb\/Sr, Clauer, 1974). It is represented by non-coaxial deformation in an epizonal setting and generated isoclinal synschist folds and shearing faults (Leblanc, 1975; Hassenforder, 1987). These shears cut the Paleoproterozoic schistose granitic basement into tectonic scales and are responsible for the gneissic conversion of the Eburnian granitoids (Hassenforder, 1987). The late phase occurs at a more superficial structural level and generated fracture schistosity, isoclinal folds, and shearing (Leblanc and Lancelot, 1980; Hassenforder, 1987; Oudra et al., 2005). There is no exact age for this deformation phase, but it is later than the emplacement of the Bleida granodiorite dated by zircon U-Pb technique as 615\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0Ma (Ducrot and Lancelot, 1978).\nThe Paleozoic cover lies unconformably or under the Proterozoic terrains. It begins with the \u201cTaroudant Group\u201d deposits (Ediacaran to Lower Cambrian or Adoudounian) consisting of two units: the \u201cAdoudou Formation\u201d and the \u201cLie de Vin Series Formation\u201d (the Taliwinian). The former has been subdivided into a lower member, the \u201cBase Series\u201d, composed of volcanic-sedimentary and silicoclastic deposits, and an upper carbonate limestone member, the \u201cLower Limestone\u201d (Choubert, 1963; Algouti et al., 2000; Benssaou and Hamoumi, 2001, 2003). The second one includes red\u2013purple pelites interspersed with carbonate layers (Algouti et al., 2001; Benssaou and Hamoumi, 2004). All these formations were deposited in an intracontinental basin related to the rifting affecting the Anti-Atlas at the end of the Ediacaran (Boudda et al., 1979; Soulaimani, 1998; Benssaou and Hamoumi, 2001; Soulaimani et al., 2003). The subsequent \u201cTata Group\u201d contains two formations; the \u201cUpper Dolomites Formation\u201d consisting of massive carbonate beds intercalated with siltstone beds, and the \u201cUpper Sandstones Formation\u201d (Middle Cambrian), dominated by massive pink sandstones alternating with acceptable shale levels (Choubert et al.,1952; \u00c1lvaro et al., 2007). Indeed, the terrains are intersected by the \u201cIgherm dyke\u201d oriented NE-SW, dated as 201.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0Ma (U-Pb method on zircon) by Davies et al. (2017), and is correlated to the break-up of the Pangea supercontinent (Sebai et al., 1991; Marzoli et al.,1999, 2019; Palencia-Ortas et al., 2011).\n\n\n2.2\nGeomorphology and climate\nThe geomorphological characterization of the study area is based mainly on the hypsometric map established from the ASTER GDEM digital terrain model, with a pixel size of 25\u00a0m (Fig. 3\n). The analysis of this map shows that the study area is characterized by an irregular mountainous topography, relatively steep, with altitude ranging between 350 and 2500\u00a0m. The highest reliefs are well marked in the buttonholes, culminating at the levels of the topographically elevated zones composed of harder facies (Quartzites and Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rocks). These facies contrast with topographic depressions areas composed of soft, easily eroded rocks (Paleoproterozoic metamorphics). In the cover zone, the reliefs become more moderate, in the form of carbonate plateaus (Oudra, 1988).\nThe hydrographic network is dry most of the year because the climate is of Mediterranean type with dominant arid character, characterized by temperatures of about 23\u00a0\u00b0C on average, with very important daily and seasonal variations. The average annual rainfall is very low (less than 100\u00a0mm) (Soulaimani et al., 2013). The two main rivers, the Arghren wadi, and the Tizgzawine wadi are oriented transversally to the axis of the chain; the first one flows towards the West and the second one towards the East, but both converge downstream towards the Souss wadi, the main drain of the region. Their tributaries the Assifs Bargane, Tagourjat, Tikkida, Ouzguert are from the South. They sometimes cut the Cambrian limestone and dolomite shaping impressive gorges (Fig. 3).\n\n\n2.3\nOre deposits\nThe Western Anti-Atlas (Fig. 1b), where the Igherm region is located, is full of copper-bearing concentrations: three mines in operation (Ouansimi; 1,087,000\u00a0t at 2.63% Cu, Agjgal; 5,000,000\u00a0t at 1% Cu and 20\u00a0g\/t Ag, Tazalaght; 260,000\u00a0t at 1.89% Cu), one under development (Tizert; 1,062,000\u00a0t at 2.3 % Cu and 65\u00a0g\/t Ag), about ten previously artisanal mined deposits (Alous, Assif n\u2019Imider, Tasserirt, Imi n\u2019Ifri, Talat n\u2019Ouamane, Tadenst, Tiferki, Amadouz, Tazert) and more than fifty showings (e.g., Saadi, 1968; Chalot-Prat et al., 2001; Annich et al., 2002; Oummouch et al., 2017; El Basbas et al., 2020; Abia et al., 2020). Previous studies have grouped the copper mineralization of this Anti-Atlas region into two types: (i) impregnation mineralization hosted by Upper Ediacaran andesitic to rhyolitic lavas (Ouarzazate Group), accompanied in most cases by veinlet and stockwork mineralization in crushed zones (Clavel and Leblanc, 1971; Boyer et al., 1978; Chabane and Boyer, 1979; Leblanc and Lancelot, 1980; Boyer and Boyer, 1982; Asladay et al.,1998; Maddi et al., 2011), typical examples are those of Alous and Assif n\u2019Imider in the Ouaoufengha buttonhole and (ii) stratiform and\/or vein mineralization localized in Cambrian terrigenous and\/or carbonate deposits, with as primary deposits: Ouanssimi, Tazalaght, Agoujgal and Tizirt (Pouit, 1966; Anthonioz et al., 1979; Skacel, 1993; Benssaou and Hamoumi, 1999; \u00c1lvaro, 2013). The common feature of these concentrations is their simple mineral association consisting of a primary paragenesis with bornite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite and a supergene paragenesis with copper-enriched phases; native copper, chalcocite, covellite, malachite, and azurite. Pb and Zn sulfides are rare or absent, except for rare occurrences in the Tamjout Formation. Although the epithermal affiliation of the former is well defined (Boyer et al., 1978; Chabane and Boyer, 1979; Leblanc and Lancelot, 1980; Boyer and Boyer, 1982), controversy remains regarding the genesis of the latter with diverse models including syngenetic (Pouit, 1966; Maddi et al., 2011; Oummouch et al., 2017) and epigenetic (e.g., Chazan, 1954; Fauvelet, 1973; \u00c1lvaro, 2013; El Basbas, 2015). A recent work by Abia et al. (submitted) reassigned them to the tectono-magmatic event responsible for the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) in the Triassic.\n\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nSampling\nSystematic sampling of the fine sediment fraction was carried out from the downstream domains using the 1:100,000 scale topographic map of Igherm, brought out by the British Geological Survey (BGS) in 1999 by the Moroccan Ministry of Energy and Mines. A total of 300 samples were taken as indicated by the sampling grid (Fig. 3). Sampling points were selected with consideration of several factors, including drainage density, subcatchment dimensions, and terrain accessibility, to achieve the spatial resolution required to map geochemical anomalies from various sources. The superficial layer of alluvium was removed over 10 to 20\u00a0cm to avoid any eolian contamination. The following two important factors, determinants in semi-arid regions, were taken into consideration during our study:\n\na.\nThe first one is that streams are dry almost all year long, and therefore the mechanical dispersion of elements is more important than the hydromorphic dispersion.\n\n\nb.\nThe second is that excellent aeolian material from different drainage basins can contaminate the stream sediment (Johnson et al., 2001).\n\n\n\nThus, 2\u00a0kg of fine sediments were collected from 3 points along the live bed. The samples were then homogenized and sieved on-site to obtain the particle size fraction below 80\u00a0\u00b5m. Sample points were documented with images, notes, and spatial information to build a comprehensive GIS database.\nThe collected samples were then prepared and analyzed by an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) of Spectro X-LAB 2000. This apparatus uses the dispersive energy of X-rays (ED XRF) and allows the determination of many elements. The analyzed elements Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg (Table 1\n) are chosen, taking into account their main Physico-chemical properties for the remote prospecting method used in this study.\n\n\n3.2\nData processing\n\nFig. 4\n presents a flow chart of the methodology adopted to process the stream sediment data. The first step was to identify the genetic relationships among the different variables (chemical elements). This was done using the factor analysis approach, which revealed three factors: F1 (Pb-Cd), F2 (Zn-Ni-Cr), and F3 (Cu). The second step is to strengthen the geochemical signatures of the anomalies in the factor scores of the FA associations, using the GMPI function. The GMPI maps are then geologically interpreted to determine the sources of the anomalies. The third step is to investigate exploration prospects for copper mineralization in the study area. This step is challenging because the anomalies can originate from multiple sources, resulting in complex spatial mixing. This step was solved using fractal\/multifractal modeling which allowed us to separate the true anomalies with those of regional geochemical background. Finally, a geochemical anomaly map was generated and combined with available geological and geological data to explain the mapped copper anomalies.\n\n3.2.1\nFactor analysis\nFactor analysis (FA) is a method that involves a couple of independent mathematical variables and reduces multivariate data sets to a few factors in order to find out hidden multivariate data structures (Krumbein and Graybill, 1965; Tripathi, 1979; Johnson and Wichern, 2007). Additionally, geochemical data from stream sediments fall into the category of compositional data and end up being a closed numerical system. Individual variables within such a system are dependent (Filzmoser et al., 2009a, b, 2010; Carranza, 2011). Therefore, factor analysis should come after the normalization of such data. The natural logarithm (Ln) is used, in this paper, to turn the multivariate geochemical data values into a conventional factor analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then utilized to extract main components to lay bare concealed multivariate data structures and limit the number of variables (Filzmoser et al., 2009a,b, 2010; Yousefi et al., 2012; Gholami et al., 2012). Stepwise factor analysis is twofold as follows.\n\nIn the first step, factor analysis is applied to all samples, but the results cannot be interpreted (Table 2\n).\n\n\nIn the second step, arsenic and mercury are discarded at this stage, so all elements have factor scores of 0.5, as shown in Table 2.\n\n\n\nThe second-factor analysis of the remaining geochemical data is used to figure out the new factors of each sample. Table 2 shows the rotated component matrix and component plot in the rotated space for the second-factor analysis. The detailed flowchart of the methodology adopted in this paper is shown in Fig. 4.\n\n\n3.2.2\nWatershed modeling\nThe spatial geomorphological parameters and hydrographic patterns, investigated in this work using the SCB mapping technique, are greatly considered in the distribution of measured geochemical variables in stream sediments (e.g. Spadoni et al., 2005; Spadoni, 2006). This approach relies on the firm relationship of a statistical representativeness domain with each sample and assumes that the measured concentrations can be viewed in reference to values for the drained sub-basin.\nBy ascribing the concentration element value to the subwatershed upstream of the sampling point and considering the sampling points in the drainage network, drainage analysis, and watershed delineation, SCB can be smoothly identifiable (Spadoni et al., 2005; Spadoni, 2006; Garousi Nezhad et al., 2017; Ouyang and Rao, 2018). In view of the number of collected samples in the Igherm area with respect to the density of the drainage network and the extent of the area, geochemical maps are created by tracing the sub-catchments using the ASTER GDEM (Fig. 3).\n\n\n3.2.3\nGMPI mapping\nAfter recognizing geochemical multi-elements, a transformation of the FA factor analysis values into a new data space was applied. This transformation\u2019s application improves the discrimination of geochemical anomalies (Yousefi et al., 2014; Yousefi and Carranza, 2015a; Saadati et al., 2020). An operative tool to engender unbounded values in the range [0, 1] for MPM use has a striking logistical function. Several sorts of logistic functions (Theodoridis and Koutroumbas, 2006) may be utilized to modify a data set in the [0, 1] range based on the minimum and maximum values of the data and the slope variations in-between (Carranza, 2008; Yousefi et al., 2012). Yousefi et al. (2012, 2013, 2014) suggested that the Geochemical Mineralization Prospectivity Index (GMPI) should turn geochemical data values into the same [0, 1] space in accordance with the equation (1):\n\n(1)\n\n\nGMPI\n=\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nFS\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\ne\n\n\nFS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFS is the sampling score factor obtained from the factor analysis (FA), and GMPI is the fuzzy weight of each component of the stream sediment indicator based on the F1, F2, and F3 factors obtained from FA.\n\n\n3.2.4\nC-A fractal model\nThe spatial distribution of geochemical data for anomaly delineation has been analyzed through a number of fractal models including Concentration-Area fractal model (C-A) (Cheng et al., 1994), Spectrum-Area fractal model (S-A) (Cheng et al., 1996), Concentration\u2013Distance model (C-D) (Li et al., 2003), Concentration\u2013Volume model (C-V) (Afzal et al., 2011), Concept of singularity (Cheng, 2007), and Concentration- Concentration model (C\u2013C) (Sadeghi, 2020). Their fundamental concepts revolve around the separation of geochemical anomalies from different sources. The concentration-area (CA) technique (Cheng et al., 1994; Cheng, 2012) is applied in this paper to design and categorize the spatial spreading of geochemical indicators (Carranza, 2008; Ghezelbash et al., 2019; Ghezelbash and Maghsoudi, 2018a,b; Zuo, 2011; Echogdali et al., 2021).\nThe following equation can describe the C-A fractal model in 2D space:\n\n(2)\n\n\nA\n\n\n\u03c1\n\u2264\n\u03d1\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n-\n\na\n1\n\n\n\n;\nA\n\n\n\u03c1\n\u2264\n\u03d1\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n-\n\na\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, A(\u03c1) refers to the area with high concentration values above the geochemical \u03c1 values, \u03d1 represents the threshold value, and a1 and a2 are fractal dimensions of the anomaly and background populations following this order.\nThe ensuing log\u2013log C-A plot determines the threshold values of geochemical populations in elementally transformed data in SCB models (Cheng et al., 1994, 1996). The breaks between the straight-line segments on this graph and the corresponding \u03c1 values are used as the brinks that sort the geochemical values into various components, placing different causal factors, like geochemical processes and lithologic differences (Cheng et al., 1994; Carranza, 2009; Afzal et al., 2010; Zuo et al., 2012, 2013; Echogdali et al., 2021).\n\n\n3.2.5\nEvaluation of used approaches using Prediction\u2013area (P\u2013A) plot\nA prediction area (P-A) plot is made use of in order to evaluate the GMPI Cu (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015a, b, c, 2016). Known mineral deposits are distinguished as test points on the classified GMPI Cu map in the P-A plot. Strongly marked are occupied areas and the percentage of predicted mineral occurrences. Thus, the ability and effectiveness of GMPI Cu to delineate new targets for mineral exploration are evaluated by means of two curves in the P-A plot. Equally, the Normalized density (Nd) and its weight (We) are calculated using the intersection point. The division of the prediction rate of a multi-element geochemical layer by its match-occupied area extracted from the AP plot intersection point yields Nd. It is figured out by taking the ln of Nd (Mihalasky and Bonham-Carter, 2001). A value of Nd\u00a0>\u00a01 and We\u00a0>\u00a00 indicate a positive association with the searched deposit (Yousefi and Carranza, 2015c).\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussion\n\n4.1\nFactor analysis\nThe factor analysis revealed three principal components with eigenvalues>0.5. The F1 factor shows a Pb-Cd association, the F2 factor shows a Cr-Ni-Zn association and the last factor F3 shows Cu. As shown in Table 2, the Cu association total variance, a significant indicator of copper deposits, decreased from 13.94% in the first factorial analysis to 12.59% in the second factorial analysis. This decrease was due to the removal of mercury (Hg) which allowed us to improve the information on copper in the second stage. On the other hand, the total variances for the Pb-Cd and Ni-Cr-Zn associations increased from 32.8% and 28.1%, respectively, in the first-factor analysis to 38.3% and 35.6% in the second. The staged factor analysis results allow us to remove poor indicator geochemical elements (such as Hg) in F3 and increase the total variance related to the F1 and F2 factors. Besides, the separation of the three variables (F1, F2, and F3) was improved. Consequently, stepwise factor analysis identifies, in a better way, anomalous geochemical signatures of the deposit being sought (Yousefi et al., 2012, 2013, 2014). Thus, the spatial distribution of the FA associations\u2019 factor scores (F1, F2, and F3) is shown in Fig. 5\n. The spatial variability of the chemical signature of stream sediments observed is related to the diversity of geological formations (Kirkwood et al., 2016) that characterize the study area. From a geomorphological point of view, this spatial variability is controlled by the irregular topography and the well-developed hydrographic network. These two parameters have allowed the drainage of all the geological formations outcropping in the study area and have facilitated the dispersion of the eroded materials in their secondary environment.\n\n\n4.2\nGMPI mapping of geochemical anomalies\nThe results of this transformation are assigned to the corresponding watershed providing geochemical maps which reflect the spatial distribution of GMPIs of the three groups (GMPI Pb-Cd, GMPINi-Cr-Zn, and GMPICu) at the subwatershed level (Fig. 6\n). The GMPI results show that the intensity of geochemical anomalies has been increased because some sub-catchments in the GMPI map are determined as areas of high anomaly, whereas, in the corresponding FS map, these sub-catchments are of medium and low anomaly. In Fig. 6a, the GMPIPb-Cd anomaly values occupy the sub-catchments in the northwestern and western part of the study area, while the FSPb-Cd result occupies only some sub-catchments in the western part. In Fig. 6b and 6c, the anomaly rate of the GMPICr-Ni-Zn and GMPICu sub-catchments is higher than that of FSCr-Ni-Zn and FSCu, respectively. These results corroborate those reported by Yousefi et al. (2012) and Yousefi et al. (2014), who showed that FS transformation increases and improves the prediction rate of GMPI. Therefore, MPM maps can be successfully used in the exploration of new target areas.\nIn contrast, modeling geochemical variability using multi-element relationships allows linking areas of high or low geochemical levels to specific geological phenomena. For example, the GMPIPb-Cd is high in sub-basins where Pb occurrences outcrop in the Wawfengha buttonhole vicinity (Fig. 6a). The GMPI of the Cr-Ni-Zn association is high in sub-catchments located where Precambrian basement formations outcrop. This spatial relationship suggests that the basic volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks are the sources of this association\u2019s high concentrations. Also, the zinc concentration shows high values in basins where Pb-Zn shows an outcrop at the surface (Fig. 6b). On the other hand, the highest copper GMPI values are concentrated around the surface showings of copper. This suggests that copper mineralization is the source of this element\u2019s geochemical signature (Fig. 6c).\n\n\n4.3\nClassification of anomalies and delineation of copper exploration targets\nIt is of great importance to investigate the geochemical signatures representing the type of the highly sought deposit for exploration (Andrade de Palomera et al., 2012; Yousefi and Nyk\u00e4nen, 2015; Parsa et al., 2016). Multi-element associations have been used as indices for deposit exploration in so many areas (Cooke et al., 2005; Weixuan et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009; Yousefi et al., 2012; Echogdali et al., 2021). However, in the study area, the Pb-Cd and Cr-Ni-Zn associations fail to reveal a positive spatial association with the type of deposit sought. Therefore, only the copper GMPI is classified by the C-A fractal modeling. The obtained results are introduced in four populations of multi-fractal nature for the copper GMPI data. The first three populations have extremely low to medium anomaly concentrations, whereas the last population has a very high anomaly concentration. In the log\u2013log plot for Cu GMPI values, a uniform slope shows a fractal dimension so that threshold values can be admitted as breakpoints in the plot. In this work, the C-A fractal model (Fig. 7\na) is used to group the GMPI Cu geochemical anomalies. The thresholds are set to bring about the classified GMPI Cu map (Fig. 7b).\nTo individualize the sub-catchments that contain true copper anomalies, the Prediction-Area P-A method was applied. Based on the parameters of the intersection points in the P-A plot in Fig. 8\na, GMPI Cu predicts 40% of the study area as prospective in which 60% of the known Cu occurrences are delineated. The normalized density is therefore 1.5 and its weight is 0.41, indicating that areas with high GMPI Cu values can be used as targets for future Cu ore exploration in the Igherm area (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n4.4\nImplications for mining\nIn the Western Anti-Atlas, copper mineralization is heterogeneous. Those hosted in the Paleozoic cover occur either as stratiomic impregnations within the conglomerates and sandstones of the Upper Ediacaran (PIII), the siltstones and limestones of the Basic Series and the Tamjout dolomites of the Lower Cambrian \u201cTizert Type\u201d, or in the form of seams crossing the Precambrian basement as well as all the Cambrian formations \u201cOuansimi type\u201d, or even those of the Ordovician as is the case in Oumjrane in the eastern Anti-Atlas. In the study area, the stratiomic impregnation mineralizations that have been mined are all located around the edges of the Precambrian buttonholes where the bearing formations largely outcrop. Outside these areas, they are concealed by the lower limestones, and their direct prospection remains difficult. However, their dispersal trails along the hydrographic network allowed them to be delineated by processing geochemical analyses of the fine fraction of stream sediments. Thus, after a series of processing of geochemical data of stream sediments, a geographical distribution map of the anomalous sub-catchments in copper was established (Fig. 9\na). These basins are 31 in number, 90% of which are located in the vicinity of Precambrian buttonholes, along with the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, which is the preferred zone for stratiform copper concentrations, and 67% of which are traversed by major tectonic faults that occasionally host mineralized veins. To corroborate the origin of these copper anomalies, we have exploited the information represented in the geological section carried out at the Tizert deposit (Poot et al., 2020) (Fig. 9b). This shows that stratiform copper mineralization is located at the base of the Cambrian transgression, in the Basin Series sandstones\/silts and the Tamjout limestones (Fig. 9b). In this representation, mineralized zones are well developed along the margins of adjacent basins in the vicinity of and around Precambrian basement paleo-reliefs. This suggests that copper gets enriched in the secondary environment when the host strata is exposed at the surface. Furthermore, an origin related to the primary and secondary dispersal of the vein mineralization cannot be excluded. The hydrothermal fluids that gave rise to these veins, by percolating through the Paleozoic cover and migrating towards the surface along faults, would be at the origin of a copper enrichment of the rocky envelope of the mineralized body (Miftah et al., 2020; Ouchchen et al., 2021; Mamouch et al., 2022).\nAround 40% of the anomalous sub-catchments identified do contain copper showings and\/or old deposits. These are certainly at the origin of the stream sediment anomalies. As examples, we cite the Tizert deposit which caused geochemical anomalies in sub-catchments 1 and 2, the Tiferki deposit which contaminated basins 6 and 7, and the former Amadouz deposit which caused anomalies in basins 25 and 26. The other anomalous sub-catchments are devoid of any visible surface copper occurrences. They constitute promising zones. The mineralized bodies that are at the origin of their anomalies are hidden in the subsurface and their delineation requires close sampling. First, a tightly meshed sampling of stream sediments within each subcatchment. The small areas selected during this operation will then be subjected to a soil survey.\nOur approach constitutes an important step of geochemical prospecting that allows us to orient and optimize the search for copper mineralization at the scale of the Western Anti-Atlas. It involves selecting anomalous sub-basements, of an area hardly exceeding a dozen km2, via the geochemistry of stream sediments. The mineralizations outcropping on the surface, old exploitations and showings that are close to some sub-basement are listed confirm the result obtained and support our working method to highlight potential areas for the exploration of new copper deposits.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, regardless of the origin of the copper present in the stream sediments, the mapped sub-basins have a high copper potential and deserve to be explored further, as they are defined as potential areas for the exploration of new copper deposits. On the other hand, some of the obtained targets have a spatial correlation with known copper occurrences, which confirms the excellent choice of the approach we adopted in the present study. Consequently, the geochemical mapping discussed in this article constitutes a valuable tool for exploring new copper ore deposits in the Igherm region. The methodology adopted in this study can be extended over the entire territory of the Anti-Atlas.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nM.

(e.g., Hedenquist and Matsuhisa, 1987; White and Hedenquist, 1990; Sidorov et al., 2015; Nadeau et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2020a). In particular, it is considered that volcanic structures provide pathways for fluid injection and accommodation space for ore deposition, with the assumption that mineralization postdates the volcanism (e.g., Arribas et al., 1995; Stix et al., 2003; Williams-Jones and Heinrich, 2005; Guo et al., 2020a). Nonetheless, recent studies on modern volcanos and magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits suggest that episodic fluid ingression and brecciation of overlying rocks played crucial roles in fluid depressurization and mineral precipitation (Hattori and Keith, 2001; Maughan et al., 2002; Nadeau et al., 2016).\nHow compressive deformational structures influenced the ore deposition is another topical issue (Cox, 1995, 2016; Hou et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017). In cases, it has been proposed that (1) the high displacement faults and shearing networks could provide pathways linking the \u201cupstream\u201d fluid reservoirs at depth to shallow crustal level (Cox, 1995; Nguyen et al., 1998; Kenworthy and Hagemann, 2007); (2) The propagative faulting and rapturing triggered repeated high flux fluid activities (Boullier and Robert, 1992; Cox, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017); (3) The fault- and fold-related dilation system along with fluid-driven growth of fracture permeability provided \u201cdownstream\u201d space for the precipitation of the ores (Sibson et al., 1988; McCuaig and Kerrich, 1998; Cox et al., 2001, 2005).\nHowever, structural controls on the formation of ore deposits hosted in fault zones, which are affected by intensive volcanism, are less clear and may vary significantly. The fluid localization and mineralization within these systems could be associated with the margin of a caldera, its interior structures, and adjacent regional structures (e.g., Lipman et al., 2015; Garden et al., 2017). In addition, the regional structural setting, particularly the temporal and spatial relations between the tectonic deformation and caldera-forming events, exert crucial influences on the mineralization patterns. For example, it is noted that post-caldera regional faults could reactivate the ring faults of the volcanic edifice and promote the localization of later-stage fluid flow (Rytuba et al., 1990; Elston, 1994; Rytuba, 1994). Nonetheless, calderas commonly result from multi-stage magmatism which may continue for several million years (Elston, 1994; Acocella, 2007). Therefore, large-scale centric volcanism overprinting a pre-existing regional structural discontinuity would (1) induce repetitive magmatism and fluid ingression focusing on the regional structural weakness and (2) form relatively intact volcanic loads that may blanket later-stage fluid influx (Tramparulo et al., 2018 and references therein). This complexity highlights the necessity of investigation on the structural settings of this type of ore deposits.\nThe Pb-Zn (Ag-Cu) deposits in the Gangdese retro-arc zone (GRAZ) are important components of the Tethyan metallogenic domain (Richards, 2011; Tang et al., 2014, 2016; Hou et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015a, 2016; Zheng et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2017). Voluminous Pb-Zn deposits were identified in the eastern segment of the GRAZ and interpreted as being controlled by the Gangdese retro-arc trust-fold systems (Wang et al., 2010; Ding, 2017; Fu et al., 2017). In contrast, the western GRAZ, characterized by extensive Cenozoic eruptive magmatism and significant crustal shortening (Kapp and DeCelles, 2019; Zhu et al., 2019), hosts fewer deposits (Fig. 1). However, examples from other world-class metallogenic domains suggest that the combination of compressive deformation and intensive volcanism provides favorable conditions for ore deposition (e.g., Bissig et al., 2002; Richards, 2013). Recently, a series of Pb-Zn (Ag-Cu) deposits were discovered in the western GRAZ (Ji et al., 2012, 2014; Tang et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017, 2020). Yet, their structural settings are still unclear because of the scarcity of data. For instance, although vital for understanding the structural evolution and metallogeny of the GRAZ, the thrusting polarity of the LMF is variously interpreted as north or south vergent based on observations at different locations (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007a). Nevertheless, limited data on the temporal and spatial relations between the LVS and LMF hampered further discussion on their control on the mineralization (Tang et al., 2016). In addition, how these structures control the deposit-scale fluid migration, redistribution and localization still await further investigation.\nThe Narusongduo Pb-Zn deposit displays obvious spatial association with the regional thrust-fold system and the Linzizong volcanic edifice (Ji et al., 2012, 2014; Ji, 2013), comparable with several economically significant deposits worldwide (e.g., Redwood, 1987; Cunningham et al., 1994; Mil\u00e9si et al., 1999; Klemm et al., 2008). Previous studies focused on ore geology, geochemistry and geochronology (Ji et al., 2012, 2014; Ji, 2013; Yang et al., 2015b; Gong et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020), whilst its structural setting is still largely unknown. In this study, we conducted (1) geological mapping and structural analyses to reveal the structural frame of the Narusongduo region; (2) field and microscopic observations to investigate the characteristics of the fracture and void systems and their controls on the mineralization, and present (3) a discussion on the possible mineralization model with the newly obtained structural and zircon U-Pb chronological data. They provide new insight into the structural controls on Pb-Zn mineralization in the Gangdese retro-arc zone. This contribution also sheds new light on our understanding of the generation of ore deposits in a compressional deformed site affected by intensive volcanism.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nIt is widely accepted that the Tibetan Plateau is a tectonic collage composed of several east\u2013west trending allochthonous blocks that accreted to the southern margin of Eurasia since the early Paleozoic (All\u00e9gre et al., 1984; Dewey et al., 1988; Yin and Harrison, 2000). The Lhasa terrane delineated by the Indus-Yarlung suture in the south and the Bangong-Nujiang suture in the north is the southern edge of the Eurasia continent (Fig.\u00a01a; Zhu et al., 2009, 2011, 2019; Pan et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019). Based on the distribution of crystalline rocks, volcano-sedimentary covers, and major tectonic boundaries, the Lhasa terrane is subdivided into the northern, central, and southern sub-terranes by several E-W striking fault zones or m\u00e9lange belts (Fig.\u00a01b; Pan et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019). The Narusongduo (NRSD) region straddles the boundary between the southern and central Lhasa sub-terranes and is truncated by the Luobadui-Milashan fault zone (LMF) (Fig.\u00a01c).\nThe northern Lhasa subterrane comprises minor Triassic sedimentary rocks, Jurassic-Cretaceous sedimentary strata, and abundant Cretaceous volcanic rocks. The eruptive ages of the volcanic sequence are constrained between ca. 130 and 110\u00a0Ma by zircon U-Pb dating (Zhu et al., 2011). A Cretaceous batholithic complex composed of granodiorites, diorites, and mafic dykes is exposed along the northern Lhasa sub-terrane (Pan et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2019). Ages obtained by sericite Ar-Ar and zircon U-Pb methods indicate that they were emplaced during ca. 140\u2013110\u00a0Ma (Kapp et al., 2007b; Zhu et al., 2011, 2016; Haider et al., 2013; Volkmer et al., 2014). The igneous rocks are either described as products of the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic plate (Kapp et al., 2005, 2007b) or alternatively related to the southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean lithosphere (Zhu et al., 2016).\nThe central Lhasa subterrane is considered as a microcontinent with a Precambrian basement that underwent multi-stage metamorphism during the Neoproterozoic, late Triassic, and Cenozoic (Zhu et al., 2011). Early Paleozoic carbonate rocks, Carboniferous to Permian meta-sedimentary rocks, and Mesozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences unconformably overlie the crystalline basement. Mesozoic plutons that were emplaced between\u00a0\u223c\u00a0215\u00a0Ma and\u00a0\u223c\u00a095\u00a0Ma discretely extend for ca. 1200\u00a0km (Pan et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019).\nThe southern Lhasa subterrane is characterized by composite intrusive rocks that mainly formed from ca. 210\u00a0Ma to 10\u00a0Ma (Zhu et al., 2015, 2017; Wang et al., 2020) and eruptive rocks including the Jurassic Yeba Formation, Jurassic-Cretaceous Sangri Group, and Paleogene Linzizong volcanic succession (LVS; Mo et al., 2005, 2008; Zhong et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2015, 2019; Ma et al., 2017b). The magmatic rocks that formed since 140\u00a0Ma in the southern Lhasa terrane are designated as the Gangdese arc and thought to have formed during the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab and the ensuing India-Asia collision (Kapp et al., 2007a; Ding et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019). The massive Cretaceous-Paleogene Gangdese batholiths mainly consist of granites, granodiorites, and diorites (Mo et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2011). The LVS is exposed along the boundary of the southern and central Lhasa subterranes (Mo et al., 2008). Detailed stratigraphic studies on the LVS near the Linzhou basin divided the volcanic successions into the Dianzhong, Nianbo, and Pana Formations from bottom to top (Liu, 1993; Dong et al., 2005). The reported eruptive ages of the LVS range from\u00a0\u223c\u00a069\u00a0Ma to\u00a0\u223c\u00a043\u00a0Ma (He et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009, 2012; Zhu et al., 2015, 2019; Liu et al., 2018). In the eastern Gangdese, the weakly deformed LVS in the Linzhou region unconformably overlies the strongly folded Mesozoic clastic rocks. Timing of the deformation is constrained at\u00a0\u223c\u00a072\u201369\u00a0Ma by the youngest dated volcanic rocks of the Cretaceous strata (Sun et al., 2012) and the oldest zircon U-Pb age obtained from the base of the overlying Dianzhong formation (Zhu et al., 2017).\nThe E-W trending Luobadui-Milashan fault (Fig.\u00a01b) between the central and southern Lhasa sub-terranes is regarded as part of the Gangdese retro-arc thrust system (Kapp et al., 2007a) or as a retro-arc fault-uplift zone (Pan et al., 2012). Previous investigations on the eastern Gangdese imply that the Gangdese retro-arc zone is a propagative northward thrust system active during the late Cretaceous to Eocene (Kapp et al., 2007a; Pan et al., 2012; Kapp and DeCelles, 2019). These E-W trending thrusts dip to the south and generally juxtapose the Carboniferous-Permian strata above the Mesozoic and younger rocks (Pullen et al., 2008). The LMF in the eastern Gangdese, however, is represented by a series of N-dipping thrust nappes (Kapp et al., 2007a). Some authors interpreted this structure as a folded N-directed thrust belt involved in the evolution of the so-called Lhasa-Linzhou ramp anticline (Kapp et al., 2007a; Pullen et al., 2008).\nThe LMF to the west of the Nyenchen Tanglha range was less investigated, and its geometric and kinematic features are not clear. For example, it has been argued that the LMF to the south of Cuoqin county juxtaposed the Paleozoic units southwardly over the Jurassic-Cretaceous sequences (Murphy et al., 1997). Some geologists thus proposed that the LMF, along with the south-dipping Gar-Lunggar-Comai Fault (GLCF), form a fan-shaped pop-up structure (Murphy et al., 1997). In contrast, others suggested that the western segment of the LMF was formed by north-vergent thrusting and then locally folded and reversed (Kapp et al., 2003, 2007a). In addition, recent structural and seismic studies demonstrate that the Gangdese magmatic belt in the Xigaze-Xietongmen region is dominated by north-vergent folding and thrusting, which differs from the proposed structural model for its eastern segment (Guo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). In this case, a question emerges as to how the LMF in the Narusongduo area was deformed.\nThe Gangdese magmatic arc hosts numerous porphyry copper polymetallic deposits and is known as the Gangdese porphyry copper belt, constituting a principal part of the Tethyan metallogenic domain (Richards, 2009, 2015; Tang et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2010, 2014; Zhong et al., 2012; Hou and Zhang, 2015; Hou et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015a; Lang et al., 2019). Recently, a series of Pb-Zn (Ag-Cu) deposits were explored in the Gangdese retro-arc zone (Fig.\u00a01b, c) and are described as a part of the Gangdese retro-arc Pb-Zn-Ag-Cu metallogenic belt (Wang et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2017a; Zhou et al., 2017, 2020). This belt is near parallel to the Gangdese porphyry copper belt and can be subdivided into eastern and western segments by the NNE-SSW striking Nyenchen Tanglha range. The deposits in the eastern part (Yaguila, Mengya\u2019a, Longmala, and Lietinggang deposits) are generally hosted in carbonate rocks, with ore-forming ages ranging from\u00a0\u223c\u00a062\u00a0Ma to\u00a0\u223c\u00a042\u00a0Ma (Wang et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2014, 2015; Yang et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2017a). The published evidence indicates that these hydrothermal deposits were commonly controlled by thrust-fold systems (Tang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). In contrast, the major deposits (e.g., Sinongduo, Narusongduo, and Zexue deposits) in the western segment are hosted both in the carbonate strata and the LVS (Ji et al., 2012; Li et al., 2019a; Guo et al., 2020b). Available ore-forming ages in the western GRAZ range from\u00a0\u223c\u00a065\u00a0Ma to\u00a0\u223c\u00a055\u00a0Ma (Ji et al., 2014; Ke et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019a), highly comparable with the duration of the Linzizong volcanism. In addition, several deposits are reported to be controlled by the volcanic structures and related to the brecciation of the host rocks (Ji et al., 2014; Li et al., 2019a).\n\n\n3\nGeology of the Narusongduo region\nWe carried out geological mapping in the Narusongduo region (Fig.\u00a01c) and structural analysis along a ca. 30\u00a0km north\u2013south section covering major lithological units and significant structures (Fig. 2\n). In the following paragraphs, we first briefly elaborate on the lithologies, then describe the thrust-fold system and volcanic structures in this region.\n\n3.1\nMap units\nMap units in the Narusongduo region range in age from the late Carboniferous to Quaternary. The oldest rocks in the study area are the late Carboniferous-early Permian meta-sedimentary rocks known as the Angjie or Laga Formation (Figs. 1c, 2 and 3\n). This unit reaches over 100\u00a0m in thickness and mainly consists of gray and dark gray meta-sandstone and slate with minor thin carbonate interlayers (Liu et al., 2019). The clastic rocks contain lithic fragments and quartz and feldspar grains, with a fine interstitial matrix and cemented by clay minerals (Liu et al., 2019). These Paleozoic strata are highly deformed and occasionally metamorphosed (Fig.\u00a04\na-b). The argillaceous cement is commonly transformed into sericite, while the quartz grains are generally recrystallized (Liu et al., 2019). The foliations and stretching lineations are defined by the aligned planar and elongated minerals within the rocks (Fig.\u00a04c).\nThese clastic strata are overlain by over 300\u00a0m thick mid-Permian carbonate strata with siltstone interlayers (C.G.S., 2019). These light gray ridge-forming fine-grained carbonate rocks are characterized by massive structures and generally deformed (Fig.\u00a05\na-c). In addition, the carbonate rocks are locally recrystallized and infilled by calcite veinlets (Fig.\u00a04d). The siltstone interlayers are also highly deformed and fractured, with visible sericitization and quartz recrystallization (Shi et al., 2016).\nThe Paleozoic rocks are unconformably covered by the Paleogene volcanic succession assigned to the Dianzhong Formation and minor Nianbo Formation (Fig.\u00a04e-f). These volcanic-clastic successions are widely exposed in the Narusongduo region with up to 1000\u00a0m thickness (Shi et al., 2016). Several lenticular conglomerate layers can be identified at the bottom of the LVS (Fig.\u00a04e; Shi et al., 2016). Previous studies and our geological mapping distinguished four eruptive cycles within the region (Shi et al., 2016). Each cycle could be further divided into sedimentary and volcanic packages. The sedimentary packages consist of fluvial sequences with pyroclastic intercalations. The fluvial beds are mainly composed of sandstone, siltstone and tuff, while mudstone and cherts are also recognized (C.G.S., 2019). The clastic rocks contain poorly to moderately sorted pyroclastic and terrigenous grains filled with interstitial detritus and cemented by calcareous and argillaceous materials (Shi et al., 2016). The volcanic units are generally made up of volcanic lava flows with pyroclastic interlayers. The eruptive rocks are mostly andesitic, dacitic, and rhyolitic in composition and reddish, brown, and white in color. They display porphyry texture featured by feldspar and quartz phenocrysts and lithic fragments embedded in a groundmass composed of glass, fine-grained felsic minerals, and vitric pyroclasts. (Fig.\u00a04h-i; Shi et al., 2016).\n\n\n3.2\nThrust-fold system\nThe LMF in the Narusongduo region is represented by several sub-parallel south-dipping thrusts within an E-W trending fault zone whose width varies between 5 and 7\u00a0km (Figs. 2, 3, 5a-c; C.G.S., 2019). In the northern margin of the thrust zone, strongly deformed Permian carbonate rocks thrust northwards on the Linzizong volcanic rocks along the south-dipping Qingdu fault (F1). The southern margin of the fault zone is marked by the south-dipping Mainong thrust (F2), which juxtaposes strongly folded Cretaceous clastic rocks in the hanging wall against Permian carbonate rocks in the footwall (Fig. 2). The rock slice sandwiched between these two significant faults, is dominantly composed of fossil-bearing Permian carbonate rocks and minor upper Carboniferous-lower Permian slate (Fig. 2). These Paleozoic units are strongly folded with axial planes dipping to the south (Fig.\u00a05a-b), and unconformably overlain by the weakly deformed LVS (Fig.\u00a05d). Two south-dipping reverse faults extend discontinuously within the LMF between the faults F1 and F2 (Figs.\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a05c). The northern one juxtaposes the Carboniferous-Permian meta-clastic and carbonate rocks northwards against the Paleogene LVS. In contrast, the southern south-dipping thrust cuts both the Paleozoic sequences and the LVS. These thrusts are considered as part of the imbricate structure within the LMF (Fig.\u00a01c).\nTo the north of F1, the outcrops of the Paleozoic strata are made up of meta clastic rocks, while Permian carbonate rocks are also recorded by the drill core data from the footwall of fault F1 (Shi et al., 2016). The Paleozoic sequences were deformed into several E-W trending tight folds with shallowly plunging hinges (Fig.\u00a05e). The geometric features of the deformed strata include recumbent isoclinal and box folds (C.G.S., 2019). These structures constitute an anticlinorium with an axial plane dipping steeply to the south and wavelengths up to 8\u00a0km (Fig. 2). The tightly folded Paleozoic sequence is unconformably overlain by the LVS composed of medium to thick-bedded felsic lava and tuffaceous rocks (Fig.\u00a05f). The LVS was involved in the fault-related folds in a 1 to 2\u00a0km wide E-W trending zone right to the north of F1 (Fig.\u00a05a-b). In comparison, the volcanic rocks further to the north are nearly undeformed (Fig.\u00a06\na-b). This spatial structural trend indicates propagative deformation during the lifespan of Linzizong volcanism. At the northern end of the cross-section and the core of the anticlinorium, the Paleozoic clastic rocks were intruded by Triassic and Paleogene granitoids (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.3\nVolcanic-related structures\nThe LVS within the LMF covers a region with E-W length of over 20\u00a0km and N-S width of 2\u20136\u00a0km and sporadically overlies the thrust faults within the LMF (Fig.\u00a01c). The weakly deformed volcanic succession comprises rhyolites, dacites and minor andesites. Eruptive structures, such as lava flows, diatremes, and volcanic pipes are well preserved (Fig.\u00a06a-d). The felsic lava flows are ca. 0.5 to 15\u00a0m in thickness, and unconformably covered by later volcanic sequences, implying multi-phase volcanism (Fig.\u00a06a-d). A caldera was identified in the Narusongduo region based on the radial dips of the lava flows away from the caldera and ring-shaped geomorphological features (Fig.\u00a01c). The volcanic rocks are crosscut by voluminous steep fractures that are subdivided into the radial and ring-shaped groups according to their spatial relations to the lava flows (Figs. 3 and 6).\nSeveral volcanic pipes with elliptic cylindrical shapes are noticed on the northern slope of the Narusongduo caldera (Fig. 12). These pipes consist of fine-grained porphyries, lavas, and minor pyroclastic rocks and are interpreted as volcanic plugs. Their borders are usually characterized by steep sheeted fractures (Fig.\u00a012a and 13). Most of the plugs are characterized by brecciation, alteration, and formation of secondary minerals, indicating fluid influx after the solidification of the rocks (Ji et al., 2012).\nThe LVS to the north of the F1 fault comprises dacitic to rhyolitic volcanic and pyroclastic rocks attributed to the Dianzhong Formation. This unit is unconformably overlain by the Nianbo Formation represented by minor reddish felsic volcanic rocks, and tuffaceous sandstone has also been noticed (C.G.S., 2002; Ding, 2017). These volcanic rocks are locally involved in the thrust-fold system and underlain by the anticlinorium composed of Paleozoic sequences (Fig. 2). The volcanic structures exposed in the northern section include lava flows dipping mildly to the east and steeply dipping fractures with E-W or NNE-NNW strike (Fig. 2). These structures are thought to be genetically linked to the Sinongduo caldera further to the west (Fig.\u00a01c).\n\n\n\n4\nStructural controls on mineralization\nThree main orebodies are identified in the Narusongduo ore deposit, the orebodies I, II, III (Figs. 1 and 2). Orebody I is hosted in the LVS and orebody II occurs near the unconformity between the LVS and the Permian carbonate rocks (Fig. 3). Both orebodies are closely related to volcanic structures and breccia bodies. Orebody III is located at the footwall of F1 and was mainly hosted by Permian carbonate rocks beneath the LVS cover (Figs. 7\u20139\n\n\n). The F1 fault and fault-related folds are the primary structures controlling the mineralization in orebody III (Figs. 7\u201310\n; Yang et al., 2015b).\n\n4.1\nStructural discontinuities within the thrust-fold system\nThe nearly E-W trending F1 fault zone comprises a 10\u201320\u00a0m wide lenticular breccia zone (Fig. 10a-c) and a wider damage zone (Fig.\u00a010a, g-i). The rocks in the lenticular breccia zone were broken into several lenticular \u201ccrackle breccias\u201d (Woodcock and Mort, 2008) along the network of joints (Fig.\u00a010b-c). The long axes of the brecciated rock occurrences are largely parallel to the dip of the fault plane, and no obvious rotation was observed (Fig.\u00a010c). The fractures between the fragments are filled by carbonate minerals and sulfides that are concentrated in dilational jogs (Fig.\u00a010d). These \u201cboudinage\u201d structures may have formed by episodic fluid ingression and hydrothermal \u201cself-sealing\u201d of fractures (Cox et al., 2005). The fault plane's continuous permeable fracture network could have offered a conduit for fluid recharge from deeper reservoirs to higher crustal levels.\nThe damage zone contains centimeter- to meter-sized rock blocks separated by well-developed fractures (Fig.\u00a010a). Although small-scale folds were occasionally observed, most original beddings were unrecognizable due to substantial shortening and deformation. The damage zone of F1 shows a variable N-S width between ca. 20 to 100\u00a0m. There is no distinct boundary between the damage zone and the fault-related fold system.\nThe Paleozoic carbonate rocks exposed at the hanging wall of F1 are strongly folded and penetratively deformed, whereas drilling at the footwall reveals that the carbonate rocks are also highly strained (Figs. 8 and 9). The Paleozoic sequences were deformed into isoclinal or reverse folds with south-dipping axial planes (Fig.\u00a05a-c) and voluminous joints and tensional fractures are well developed (Fig. 10e-f). The conjugate shear joints observed in the field can be subdivided into two groups based on their occurrences and spatial relations to the beddings. Sub-vertical joints of the first group exhibit NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE strike and probably formed at the early stage of folding in response to the N-S compression. They display clear vertical continuity and provide structural control on the N-S trending river valleys (Fig. 10e-f). The second group of joints with strikes sub-parallel to the fold axial plane was observed in the folds\u2019 N-S cross-sections. This kind of joints occasionally evolved into low displacement reverse faults (Figs. 5a-b and 10e-f). Moreover, tensional fractures with E-W strikes developed at the outer limbs of the folds (Fig.\u00a010e-f). These fractures along with the bedding-parallel slip dilations form up composite fracture systems with considerable vertical extension and abundant terminal splays.\nThe Linzizong volcanic rocks at the hanging wall were generally undeformed and variably weathered (Figs. 5d and 10e-f). The LVS within the fault-related fold zone at the footwall is locally folded but less fractured in comparison with the underlying carbonate strata (Fig. 2).\n\n\n4.2\nAlteration and mineralization within the F1 fault zone\nThe fractures within the fault-fold zone controlled the distribution of the mineralization. Nevertheless, other structural surfaces such as the beddings and unconformity surface also provide space for ore deposition (Figs. 7\u20139; Shi et al., 2016). In addition, drill core data records discrete mineralized sections within the LVS overlying the deformed Paleozoic strata (Figs. 8 and 9). Mineralization in the lenticular breccia zone is represented by discontinuous bands and cement between the rock blocks. The occurrence of the sulfide ores in this zone was controlled by geometric irregularities such as jogs and fracture intersections. As a result, the ore assemblages usually wedge out along the fault dip (Fig.\u00a010d). As to the damage zones and folds near F1, the fracture networks of the thrust-fold system provide first-order control on the mineralization. The mineralization is well developed along the fracture network and forms a complex stockwork (Figs. 10g-i and 11). Calcite, quartz, and sulfides such as sphalerite, galena, pyrite, and chalcopyrite are among the minerals present in the veins (Fig. 11\n).\nHydrothermal alteration can be recognized at the boundaries between the veins and country rocks (Figs. 7\u20139). The carbonate rocks are characterized by skarnization and marbleization, while the volcanic covers were affected by chloritization, epidotization and sericitization (Shi et al., 2016). Microscopic observations reveal that the hydrothermal minerals occur in fractures and dilated zones with no preferred orientations (Fig. 11). Typical features of hydraulic fracturing, such as splayed veinlets and jigsaw boundaries between fragments, are visible (Fig. 11). In addition, carbonate-rich country rocks and earlier precipitated minerals are commonly fractured and filled by later-stage calcite, quartz and sulfides, suggesting that multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and fluid influxes formed the ore deposition (Fig.\u00a011g-i).\n\n\n4.3\nVolcanic structures\u2019 control on the orebodies\nOrebody I is hosted in several breccia pipes and dykes at the northern slope of the Narusongduo caldera. The breccia bodies are composed of rhyolitic rocks and porphyritic subvolcanic rocks and are structurally controlled by the steeply dipping radial and ring-shaped fractures related to the Sinongduo caldera.\nThe No.I-1 breccia pipe is well exposed by the mining operation (Fig. 12\n). The surface exposure of the breccia pipe is elliptical with an E-W striking long axis of 112\u2013120\u00a0m and an N-S maximum width of 45\u00a0m. The northern border of the pipe is marked by several sheeted fractures that dip steeply to the south, and some of them evolved into low displacement normal faults (Fig.\u00a013\na-b). Drilling data reveal that the breccia pipe dips to the south with dip angles between 70\u00b0\u223c80\u00b0 and is more than 300\u00a0m in depth (Fig.\u00a012c; Shi et al., 2016).\nThe volcanic rocks near the breccia pipe are intensely fractured. The ring-shaped and radial fractures separate the rocks into blocks (Fig.\u00a013c-d). It is noteworthy that the fracture system is connected with the breccia pipe and hosts several breccia dykes with N-S or NNW-SSE strikes (Fig.\u00a012b; Shi et al., 2016). These minor dykes with lengths of 5\u201320\u00a0m and widths of 0.2\u20132\u00a0m are lithologically similar to the pipe. Brecciation occurred in the pipes and along the fractures in the surrounding volcanic rocks, implying that the brecciation postdates the formation of the fracture system.\nThe fragmented country rocks and early-stage fluid-related minerals are embedded in and cemented by matrixes composed of sulfides, lithic debris, calcite and quartz. Some of the specimens contain polymictic fragments that possibly underwent milling, mixing, and forceful transportation (Fig.\u00a014\na). Nevertheless, some of the shattered wall rock fragments are characterized by triangular\u2011acute angle textures and jigsaw boundaries that are suggestive of in-situ brecciation and mineral infilling (Fig.\u00a014b-i; Taylor, 2009). Sericitization, silicification and kaolinitization were observed in the matrix and at the borders of the fragments (Figs. 14 and 15\n; Shi et al., 2016).\n\n\n4.4\nMineralization in the volcanic and subvolcanic rocks\nFluid ingression and ore precipitation are concentrated both in the dilational voids of the breccia pipes and the intersecting zones between the radial and ring-shaped cleavages (Figs. 13-15). Fluid-related alterations such as greisenization, silicification, kaolinitization and chloritization are prevalent in the country rocks (Yang et al., 2015b). Ores hosted in the volcanic and subvolcanic rocks display veined, disseminated and massive structures and were superimposed by multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and fluid injections (Fig. 15). Country rocks and preexisting minerals were cracked, and the fissures were infilled by later-stage minerals (Fig.\u00a015d-f). These features indicate multi-cycle hydrothermal activity and breaching of the fluid pathways.\nOver 20 different ore minerals were identified in the specimens collected from these two orebodies. The economic ore minerals include galena, sphalerite, native silver, chalcopyrite, and tetrahedrite (Ji, 2013). Microscopic observations demonstrate that the sulfide ores infilled the fissures with dilational jogs in the greisenized porphyry country rocks (Fig. 16\n). Nevertheless, the sulfides are usually shattered and infilled by later-stage minerals (Fig.\u00a016b-f). These micro-structures also point towards multi-cycle brecciation and ore precipitation.\n\n\n\n5\nZircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology\n\n5.1\nSamples and methods\nTwo crystal-rich rhyolite samples were collected from the northern slope of the Narusongduo caldera. To avoid the effect of fluid-present alteration, the collected samples are free of veinlets and metamorphic overprint. Moreover, the samples were taken from the gently dipping volcanic sequences that are not involved in the N-S shortening. These samples display porphyry textures with euhedral to subhedral phenocrysts of feldspar, quartz and lithic fragments, included in a groundmass composed of glass, vitric fragments and fine-grained quartz and feldspar (Fig. 4h-i). An interstitial texture could be observed with the fissures in K-feldspars filled up with secondary quartz and feldspar. The samples are characterized by rhyolitic textures and the phenocrysts are commonly wrapped by quartz ribbons (Fig.\u00a04h-i). However, the grains are randomly oriented with no signs of dynamic recrystallization or crystal distortion, suggesting that they were not subjected to simple shearing deformation.\nThe samples were crushed to the 200\u00a0\u00b5m fraction and conventional heavy liquids and magnetic separation was used to separate the heavy and ferromagnetic minerals. The zircon grains were then hand-picked and mounted on epoxy mounts that were polished to expose the internal structures of the grains. Cathodoluminescence (CL) images were taken at Nanjing Hongchuang Geological Service by using a Gatan Mono CL 3\u00a0+\u00a0Fluorescence Spectrometer attached to a Quanta 400 FEG scanning electron microscope.\nLaser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses were conducted at the Analytical Lab of the Tianjin Center, China Geological Survey by using an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS coupled with a New Wave 213\u00a0nm laser ablation system with which a laser beam of 24\u00a0\u03bcm diameter and 5\u00a0Hz frequency was used. The experimental and instrumental procedures were as described by Jackson et al. (2004). The raw data were processed by an in-house software package ICPdataCal version 11.7 (Liu et al., 2013), corrected for common lead (Andersen, 2002), and then visualized and plotted by Isoplot 3.70 (Ludwig, 2008).\n\n\n5.2\nZircon U-Pb results\nZircon grains from the two aforementioned samples are colorless and transparent (Fig.\u00a017\na, c). They have euhedral and narrow shapes with aspect ratios up to 5.0. Their clear oscillatory zoning and homogeneous texture, together with relatively high Th\/U ratios suggest an igneous origin (Corfu et al., 2003; Corfu, 2013) (Fig.\u00a017a, c; Table 1\n). Only one dated grain (No. 09) from sample SND111-2 yielded a Carboniferous apparent age (332.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0Ma), the rest of the zircons yielded concordant results and consistent 206Pb\/238U apparent ages (SND106: 65\u201354\u00a0Ma; SND111-2: 68\u201357\u00a0Ma). For sample SND106, seven out of twenty-four analyses yielded consistent and concordant apparent ages, and a mean 206Pb\/238U age of 54.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.31; Fig.\u00a017b) was calculated. A total of seven zircons from sample SND111-2 yielded consistent apparent ages with a mean age of 57.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.28; Fig.\u00a017d). Both are interpreted as the eruption ages of the dated rocks.\n\n\n\n6\nInterpretation and discussion\n\n6.1\nStructural evolution in the Narusongduo region\nThe structural history of the Narusongduo region is still a matter of discussion, primarily due to limited access and structural data. Based on our new data and recently published large-scale geological maps (C.G.S., 2019), it is possible to subdivide the late Mesozoic-Cenozoic structural evolution of the Narusongduo region into two stages.\n\n6.1.1\nN-S Crustal shortening prior to the Linzizong volcanism\nRegional N-S crustal shortening developed pervasively in the Gangdese retro-arc zone (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007a). It has been proposed that the Gangdese retro-arc thrust-fold belt accommodates over 200\u00a0km of N-S shortening in the Lhasa terrane (Kapp et al., 2007a, 2019). Our field mapping shows that the N-S crustal shortening affected the Paleozoic-Mesozoic rocks in the Narusongduo region, causing penetrative deformation. As mentioned, the structural evolution of the Narusongduo region is still a matter of debate (Ji, 2013; Ji et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015b, 2021; C.G.S., 2019). This debate centers on three correlated issues: (1) the definition of the LMF in this region; (2) the geometry and polarity of the thrust-fold system; and (3) the timing of the main stage of the N-S crustal shortening.\nFrom our mapping in the Narusongduo region and recent publications, it becomes clear that the central Lhasa sub-terrane is characterized by tightly folded and partially foliated Paleozoic sequences that constitute an anticlinorium with south-dipping axial plane (Fig.\u00a01c; C.G.S., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). On the other hand, the southern Lhasa subterrane comprises dominantly composite Mesozoic-Cenozoic intrusions and minor folded Mesozoic strata (C.G.S., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Despite the occasional presence of fractures and faults, a regional tectonic discontinuity has yet to be discovered within these sub-terranes. The E-W trending LMF running between these two tectonic units is composed of a stack of imbricate nappes truncated by several southward dipping thrust faults that cut the Paleozoic basement, the LVS cover, and the Mesozoic intrusive rocks. The fault zone is delineated by the Qingdu fault (F1) to the north and the Mainong fault (F2) to the south. They could be traced for over 80\u00a0km from west to east (C.G.S., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). Considering these distinct lithological and structural features, we define the imbricate thrust-fold system between the Qingdu and Mainong thrusts as the LMF in the Narusongduo region. The architecture of this segment of the LMF is comparable to its eastern extension to the north of Linzhou city, which comprises a stack of imbricate thrust sheets (Kapp et al., 2007a).\nPrevious studies suggested that the LMF to the north of Linzhou city thrusts towards the south. These structures were interpreted as folded and reversed N-verging thrusts at the northern flank of a ramp anticline (Kapp et al., 2007a; Pullen et al., 2008). Similar southward thrusting features were also found in the LMF near the Coqin basin further to the west (Murphy et al., 1997). Despite the lack of structural data, it has been inferred that the LMF in between the Coqin and Linzhou regions is characterized by southwards thrusting (Kapp et al., 2007a). Our observations and recent literature, however, reveal that the LMF in the Sinongduo-Narusongduo region is characterized by north-vergent thrusting and folding. The northward polarity of the thrusts is supported by (1) the asymmetry of the folded strata within the nappes and the foreland; (2) the Paleozoic basement thrusting northwards against the Cenozoic volcanic rocks; and (3) the slickensides and steps on the fault planes indicative of top-to-the-north motion (Yang et al., 2021).\nUnlike the intensely deformed Paleozoic-Mesozoic units in the Narusongduo region, the overlying LVS was weakly deformed or even undeformed. In addition, the thrust faults within the LMF are occasionally covered by the LVS (Fig.\u00a01c). The timing of this N-S contraction is thus roughly constrained by contact relations between the Paleozoic strata and overlying LVS. However, precise dating of this event is difficult due to the lack of structural and chronological constraints. In addition, structural reactivation, volcanism, and hydrothermal fluid activity in the study area further hampered direct thermochronological dating (Reiners and Brandon, 2006). It is noteworthy that the LMF to the north of Linzhou city was also covered by weakly deformed LVS. The timing of this deformation event was constrained between 72 and 69\u00a0Ma by zircon U-Pb dating (72\u00a0Ma) on a volcanic layer in the folded Cretaceous sequences (Sun et al., 2012) and an andesitic layer at the base of the overlying LVS (69\u00a0Ma) (Zhu et al., 2017). We take these chronological data from the LMF for reference and tentatively propose that the strong N-S shortening in the Narusongduo region took place during the Cretaceous-early Paleogene.\nIn summary, the first episode of deformation preserved in the Narusongduo region is characterized by regional N-S crustal shortening during the late Cretaceous-early Paleocene (Fig.\u00a018\na). This tectonic event was probably a consequence of the establishment of a Cordilleran-type continental margin at the southern Lhasa terrane (Ding and Lai, 2003; Kapp and DeCelles, 2019).\n\n\n6.1.2\nLinzizong volcanism and propagative tectonic deformation\nThe Gangdese magmatic arc experienced extensive high-K calc-alkaline magmatism during ca. 70\u201344\u00a0Ma, producing the massive Gangdese batholith and the LVS (Harris et al., 1986; Mo et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2009, 2011, 2017, 2019; Liang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2015, 2017c; Yang et al., 2016; Kapp and DeCelles, 2019). In the Narusongduo region, this stage of magmatism is represented by the widely distributed Linzizong volcanic rocks. Previous zircon U-Pb dating results suggest that these eruptions in the Narusongduo region occurred during ca. 66\u201360\u00a0Ma (Ji et al., 2012; Ding, 2017; Ding et al., 2017). Our new zircon U-Pb ages reveal that certain rhyolites in the Narusongduo region erupted later around 58\u201355\u00a0Ma. Considering that the LVS can be subdivided into four eruptive cycles and are interlayered with fluvial sedimentary rocks (Shi et al., 2016), we propose that multi-stage volcanism superimposed the Narusongduo region from the early Paleocene to early Eocene (ca. 66\u201355\u00a0Ma).\nThe tectonic setting of the Linzizong volcanism is still vigorously debated (Mo et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2015, 2019). However, research in the eastern Gangdese suggests that the retro-arc contraction continued till mid-Eocene and propagated northward with decreasing magnitude (Kapp et al., 2007a; Pullen et al., 2008). Thus, it can be questioned if the Narusongduo region experienced propagative N-S compressive deformation during the period of the Linzizong volcanism. Our structural mapping demonstrates that the LVS within the LMF was locally crosscut by thrust faults. In addition, the LVS in the LMF's footwall exhibits a regional trend toward more gentle deformation characteristics away from the fault zone. Furthermore, muscovite 40Ar-39Ar ages of 54\u201352\u00a0Ma were obtained from the LMF to the south of the Sinongduo deposit, slightly younger than the eruptive ages of the Linzizong volcanic rocks (Yang et al., 2021). It is thus reasonable to propose that the Narusongduo region was subjected to propagative N-S compressive deformation during and after the Linzizong volcanism. On the other hand, the F1 fault was locally buried by the Linzizong volcanic rocks that erupted between 58 and 55\u00a0Ma (C.G.S., 2019; Fig. 17). The Linzizong volcanic rocks, except for those in close proximity to the thrust faults, are largely undeformed (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that reactivated thrusting in the study area was characterized by multiple pulses of lesser magnitude. The pop-up and overturned structures recorded in the western and eastern extensions (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007a) of the LMF have not been identified yet in the Narusongduo region, indicating that the study area was less affected by deformation during the late Cretaceous-Paleogene N-S crustal shortening compared to the LMF\u2019s western and eastern segments. In summary, around 65\u201355\u00a0Ma ago, the region experienced extensive Linzizong volcanism and pulsed N-S contraction with a decreased shortening rate (Fig.\u00a018b). It is noteworthy that the ongoing convergence between the Indian and the Eurasian continents since\u00a0\u223c\u00a055\u00a0Ma induced widespread lithopheric shortening and multi-stage propagative deformation in the hinterland of the Tibetan plateau (Li et al., 2015). In specific, some researchers suggest that the Narusongduo region experienced propogative N-S contraction since 55\u00a0Ma (Yang et al., 2015b). This hypothsis, although lacking chonological and field evidence, highlights the necessity of examining the post-mineralization structural overprints during future investigation.\n\n\n6.1.3\nFormation of structural discontinuities in the LVS and the strongly folded basement\nStructural discontinuities, including fractures, fissures and faults, may enhance rock permeability (Sibson, 1996; Evans et al., 1997). Furthermore, the intrinsic porosity and deformational behavior of certain rock types may have an impact on their permeability (Cox et al., 2005).\nStructural analyses in our study area disclosed two sets of fractures with preferred orientations in the folded Paleozoic strata. The first group of NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE striking conjugate joints are widely developed within the carbonate rocks near the fault zone, resulting from the early-stage N-S compressive deformation. The second group of tensional and conjugate shearing joints with approximate E-W strikes were formed during the folding of the strata under coaxial compressive stress. These two types of fractures and the folded beddings formed complex conduit systems with considerable along-strike and vertical connectivity.\nSome of the fractures within the LVS near the footwall of the thrusts could be related to the compressive deformation. However, most of the fissures and fractures within the LVS show radial and tangential attitudes with respect to the volcanic center, and can accordingly be grouped into the radial and ring-shaped groups. These fractures can be formed due to volcanic activity (e.g., inflation, deflation and caldera-collapse), edifice load, or local cooling contraction (Komuro, 1987; Marti et al., 1994; Acocella, 2007). Most of these fractures and fissures are featured by tensional rupturing, limited along-strike extension and negligible displacement. Some of the ring-shaped fractures on the northern side of the volcanic edifice developed into high-angle normal faults, probably induced by differential collapse (Fig.\u00a013a-b).\nIn general, the brittle rock failures within the Paleozoic-Mesozoic units resulted dominantly from the regional compressive tectonic deformation. whereas the fractures and faults in the LVS are primarily associated with the volcanic-tectonic stress. Furthermore, experimental studies indicate that compressive deformation of the carbonate rocks may induce cataclasis and growth of microcracks parallel to maximum principal stress (Vajdova et al., 2004, 2010). These dilations could then facilitate subsequent hydrothermal activity. By comparison, pores in the argillaceous and tuffaceous rocks tend to be sealed by fine-grained clasts and fine matrix during compressive deformation (Cox et al., 2005). These differences of deformational and mechanical features may yield crucial control on later-stage fluid influxes and mineralization.\n\n\n\n6.2\nMineralization in the compressive deformational structures\nThe LMF is the first-order ore-controlling structure in the Narusongduo region, hosting the Sinongduo, Narusongduo, Xuebie and Zexue ore deposits (Fig.\u00a01c; C.G.S., 2019). Recent field mapping and drilling data point out that the Qingdu fault (F1) and related folds are key structures that controlled the mineralization of orebody III in the Narusongduo deposit (Yang et al., 2015b; C.G.S., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). However, how the fault zone promotes fluid ingression and mineralization is hitherto not clear. In addition, the structural factors that controlled the distribution and accommodation of fluid-related mineralization are rarely discussed. Nevertheless, the role of the distinct structural and lithological characteristics of the Paleozoic rocks and the LVS on the control on mineralization patterns requires further discussion.\nThe Qingdu fault (F1) contains a lenticular breccia zone and a damage zone (Fig.\u00a08a-c; Caine et al., 1996; Faulkner et al., 2010). The lenticular breccia zone is characterized by oriented clasts and a well-connected fracture network developed along the dip of the fault plane. The damage zone of F1 is composed of a complex organization of rock blocks with no preferred orientations and a matrix comprising calcareous, and siliceous minerals and fault gouge. These structures display remarkable connectivity along the fault dip and may have provided pathways for fluid redistribution from the reservoirs in the depth to the deposits at higher crustal levels. The fractures in the lenticular breccia zone are mostly filled and cemented by fault gouge composed of clay minerals and calcite, whereas sulfides are usually preserved in discontinuous voids, such as the dilational jogs. These phenomena can be explained by the \u201cfault-valve\u201d model (Sibson et al., 1988; Boullier and Robert, 1992; Cox, 1995). This model implies that fault rupture events resulted in sudden permeability enhancement and rapid fluid ingression, which was followed by deposition of fluid-related minerals and self-sealing of the fracture network. The episodic \u201cvalve opening\u201d repeatedly tapped the fluid into the fault zone and formed the incremental mineralization (Cox, 1995).\nCompressive faults are not usually preferred places for mineral deposition (Caine et al., 1996). Instead, fault damage zone and fault-related folds can promote fluid migration and provide favorable accommodation for mineralization (e.g., Rowland and Simmons, 2012). Field observations in the Narusongduo region demonstrate that fluid-related alteration and mineralization occurred extensively in the deformed and fractured carbonate rocks in close proximity to the F1 fault (Fig.\u00a010g-i). Fluid percolation and overprinting concentrated in the sections with higher densities of structural discontinuities. The fluid-related alteration and mineralization commonly developed along the steeply dipping permeable fracture systems, and are separated from the country rocks by sharp boundaries (Fig.\u00a010g-h). We thus propose that the nucleated and connected fracture systems acted as the main pathway for fluid percolation. Nevertheless, the mineralized or altered zones, which usually wedge out upward, are characterized by randomly distributed terminal splays and extensive fluid-related brecciation (Fig.\u00a010i). These observations imply that hydraulic fracturing also contributed to the growth of the fracture system accommodating the fluid influxes. The country rocks hosting the hydrothermal minerals were usually broken into polymict breccia fragments during later-stage fluid-driven mechanical overpressurization, indicative of multi-stage fluid overprinting (Fig. 11). The successive fluid-ingression events were controlled by the deformational fractures and occupied the same zone of structural weakness (Fig. 10; Shi et al., 2016). The growth of the fracture network is highly comparable with the \u201cordinary percolation model\u201d (Cox et al., 2005), in which the regional N-S compressive strain plays a vital role.\nInformation obtained from extensive exploration drilling revealed that much mineralization is hosted in the deformed carbonate rocks or the unconformity between them and the overlying LVS. The ores are spatially associated with marbleization, silicification or skarnization. Therefore, it has been proposed that this deposit is a skarn-type ore deposit (Ji et al., 2012, 2014). However, numerous discrete mineralized sections with high ore grades are observed in the LVS several meters to several hundred meters above the unconformity. In addition, both the field observation and the drilling data demonstrate that the mineralization is featured by steep occurrences and limited lateral extensions. We therefore propose an updated model to explain the mineralization patterns within different lithologies. The steeply dipping fracture systems in the strongly deformed carbonate rocks provide the principal fluid conduits and exert main controls on the alteration and mineralization. The strongly deformed and porous carbonate rocks provided ample accommodation space for ore deposition. By contrast, the gently dipping LVS with less fracture density and porosity likely acted as a mechanical barrier during fluid flow. Nevertheless, the eruptive fractures and fissures along with the locally developed deformational joints within the volcanic sequences also provide less prominent conduits for the fluid introduction. This could explain the discrete mineralization and alteration assemblages within the LVS.\n\n\n6.3\nMineralization in the volcanic structures\nIt has been observed that the mineralization in orebody I is mainly hosted in steep breccia pipes and dykes, which share similar lithological characteristics with the rhyolitic wall rocks. The surface outcrops of the breccia pipes parallel to the E-W strike of the long axes of the ring-shaped fractures (Fig.\u00a01c). The sharp contacts between the breccia bodies and the wall rocks imply that the brecciation was controlled by these E-W trending structural discontinuities. Drilling at orebody I also documented that the ore-hosting breccia pipe dips steeply to the SSE, in accordance with the dips of the ring-shaped fractures (Fig.\u00a012c; Yang et al., 2015b). Another group of fractures within the brecciated volcanic rocks strike N-S and perpendicularly intersect with the ring-shaped structures. They are interpreted as the radial group in respect to the volcanic center. Several meter-scale breccia dykes with occurrences parallel to the radial or ring-shaped tensional fractures were identified in the vicinity of the major orebodies. In summary, the occurrence of the ore-hosting breccia bodies was controlled by radial and concentric ring-shaped tensional fractures related to the Narusongduo caldera. The high density of structural discontinuities and the intersection of multiple groups of fractures likely facilitated fluid introduction and brecciation.\nBrecciated rocks with highly comminuted polymictic fragments are discovered by drilling at the No.I-1 breccia pipe (Fig.\u00a014a). The clasts within these breccias are differentially rounded and abraded, indicative of forceful transportation (Taylor, 2009). In contrast, economic mineralization is often found in breccias with a jigsaw-fit structure and curved and branched fractures, indicating rapid pressure release, in-situ brecciation, and limited clast migration. (Sillitoe, 1985; Cox, 1995). At the outcrop scale, the breccias consist of lithic clasts with a sulfide matrix that are commonly fractured into fragments during later-stage fluid influx. The cracks between these fragments are filled and sealed by later-stage hydrothermal minerals, forming polymict hydrothermal breccias (Figs. 14 and 15). It could also be noticed under a microscope that both the wall rocks and the earlier-stage minerals are cracked and infilled by later-stage minerals (Figs. 14i and 16c-f). The sharp jig-saw contacts between different generations of sulfide minerals indicate successive hydraulic fracturing and multi-stage mineral precipitation. In summary, these shreds of evidence advocate that the ore-bearing breccia bodies experienced repetitive infiltration of pressurized fluids, brecciation of wall rocks and self-sealing of the fracture system (Cox et al., 2005; Cas et al., 2011).\nThe ore-bearing breccia pipes are in close proximity to several cylindrical porphyry intrusions that are interpreted as ore-related (Ji et al., 2012, 2014; Ji, 2013; Yang et al., 2015b). They were emplaced during 62.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0Ma to 62.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91\u00a0Ma and related to the mineralization events, according to previously published studies (Ji et al., 2012, 2014). On the other hand, Argon dating on the sericite obtained from the ore-bearing breccia yielded an age of 57.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66\u00a0Ma, approximately 4\u00a0Ma younger than the intrusive magmatism (Yang et al., 2015b). In addition, our newly obtained zircon U-Pb ages of the volcanic wall rocks gave an even slightly younger range of 58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma to 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Fig. 17). It is well-established that single intrusion-cooling events and the duration of ore depositional processes are short-lived (several 104 \u2013105 years) (Glazner et al., 2004; Chiaradia et al., 2013; Karakas et al., 2017). A magmatic or hydrothermal system that appears to have lasted for millions of years is hence probably characterized by several successive magma and hydrothermal pulses (Schoene et al., 2012; Bucholz et al., 2017). Therefore, the relative wide age range of these deposits as outlined above also suggests that the Narusongduo region experienced multi-stage magmatism and incremental hydrothermal activity during the Paleocene to Eocene (Ji et al., 2012, 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2020).\nIn summary, we here introduce a conceptual formation model for the ore-controlling structures in orebody I. In the early stages of magmatism, large-scale eruption and subsequent collapse formed the Narusongduo caldera and subordinate fractures. At the sites with more intense deformation, the densely-occurring ring-shaped fractures intersect with the radial fractures and lithological surfaces, adding complexity and increasing permeabilities of the fractured wall rocks. The fracture systems may further have been affected by local normal faulting, renewed magmatism, and later-stage fluid influxes. The subvolcanic intrusions, welded volcanic rocks and infilled fluid-related cements, formed steep volcanic plugs that blocked the pathway for potential subsequent fluid migration. On the other hand, the long-lived magmatism triggered repeated overpressurized hydrothermal fluids that took advantage of the pre-existing complex structural fabric. Pressure-driven hydraulic fracturing might have occasionally broken through the barrier and could have added to the tensional fractures. Counteracting this process, the increase of permeability would have resulted in sudden drop of fluid pressure and swift deposition of hydrothermal minerals. This \u201chydrothermal sealing\u201d mechanism (Cox et al., 2005) would have subsequently been responsible for renewed fluid pressure build-up (J\u00e9brak, 1997). Eventually, multi-stage hydrothermal overprinting and time-integrated mineral deposition formed the steep orebodies in our study area.\n\n\n6.4\nImplications for mineral exploration\nOur study demonstrates that the Narusongduo Pb-Zn deposit is hosted by composite structures formed by compressive deformation alongside multi-phased volcanic activity. This process might have broader implications for Pb-Zn mineralization in the Gangdese retro-arc.\nMost of the deposits in the Gangdese retro-arc are located in the vicinity of the LMF (Fig.\u00a01b-c). The compressive deformation structures were likely formed during the late Cretaceous-Paleogene Cordilleran orogeny at the Gangdese arc and superimposed by propagative crustal shortening during the continental collision of India with Eurasia (Kapp et al., 2007a). The fault and shear zones played a key role during fluid influx from deeper reservoirs to upper crustal levels. The deposited minerals are hosted mainly by the fracture networks in the fault zone and associated folds (Wang et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2017a). It is noteworthy that the more pervasive fracturing of the carbonate rocks under compaction would enhance the permeability of the fault-fold system (Billi, 2010; Vajdova et al., 2010). Therefore, we propose that the strongly folded carbonate rocks in the LMF are suitable targets for further exploration.\nIt has been proposed that the Sinongduo and Narusongduo deposits in the central segment of the Gangdese retro-arc are genetically linked to the Linzizong volcanic rocks (Tang et al., 2016; Ding, 2017). We hypothesize that the long-lived volcanism there formed steep tensional structures that were crucial in draining overpressurized fluids to shallower levels. The repeated hydraulic brecciation and hydrothermal self-sealing produced the time-integrated mineralization that was hosted in the breccia pipes and dykes. In general, the volcanic structures, especially diatremes and volcanic plugs in the LVS are potential targets for exploration.\nAnother interesting point is the exact timing of the mineralization, or how many stages of mineralization were involved in the formation of the ore deposits. The available age constraints on the mineralization in the western GRAZ range from ca. 65\u00a0Ma to 55\u00a0Ma (see Li et al., 2019a and references therein). This period is contemporaneous with the Linzizong volcanic activity, advocating the genetic links between them (Ding, 2017). However, our study on the structural and hydrothermal overprints in the Narusongduo deposit highlights the complexity and difficulties when tackling these mineralization ages. Indeed, the time-integrated mineralization can have been formed via various pulses of fluid injection and mineral precipitation, partially resetting and blurring the dating results (Lipman et al., 1976; Nadeau et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017, 2018, 2019b). Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to illustrating the spatial patterns of the mineralization, and detailed chronological frame works should be integrated with systematic geological observation and structural analyses.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nTwo stages of structural evolution could be recognized in the Narusongduo region. The first stage, represented by the regional N-S crustal shortening, took place during the late Cretaceous-early Paleocene in response to the Cordilleran orogeny (India-Eurasia collision) at the southern Lhasa terrane. The second stage is characterized by multi-phased Linzizong volcanism (ca. 66\u201355\u00a0Ma) and propagative N-S compressive deformation with decreasing shortening rate.\n\n\n(2)\nThe mineralization in orebody III was controlled by the northern boundary fault of the Luobadui-Milashan fault zone and the adjacent E-W trending folds, which were forged during the first deformation stage. During the second stage, the thrust faults were repeatedly reactivated and the ore-forming fluids were drained to shallower crustal levels along the fault zone. These pulsed overpressurized fluids percolated through the fault zone and the overlying less deformed Linzizong volcanic succession, resulting in the mineralization and alteration.\n\n\n(3)\nThe formation of orebody I in the Narusongduo deposit was related to multi-stage magmatism and associated hydrothermal activity during the second deformational stage (ca. 66\u201355\u00a0Ma). The ores are hosted in several breccia bodies controlled by the eruptive fractures and normal faults formed by the volcanic activity. The intersection between different sets of structural discontinuities enhanced the permeability. This multi-stage magmatism and hydrothermal activity were guided along these zones of structural weakness, resulting in progressive brecciation and mineral precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMost cobalt production in the world comes from sediment-hosted copper deposits, magmatic Ni-Cu ores, five-element hydrothermal veins and laterite deposits, as a by-product. However, the Bou Azzer district in Morocco is nowadays the only locality in the world where cobalt is mined directly from Co-rich arsenide and sulfarsenide minerals as a primary ore. This world-class mining district includes more than 100 occurrences of Co-arsenide ores (Leblanc and Billaud, 1982) corresponding to more than 2% of the world\u2019s cobalt production (U.S. Geological Survey, 2013). Currently, the mean annual production is about 150,000\u00a0t of ore (Ikenne et al., 2020) at an average grade of 1% Co and 1% Ni. In addition to Co and Ni, 3\u20134\u00a0g\/t gold and silver are also recovered as by-products (Bouabdellah et al., 2016).\nAs a consequence of its huge economic potential, the district has been extensively studied over the last few decades, which has resulted in the release of research papers, theses, and unpublished mining company reports. In spite of the abundant literature, uncertainties still remain on the nature of mineral assemblages and paragenetic sequences (En-Naciri, 1995, Dolansky, 2007, Ahmed et al., 2009, Gervilla et al., 2012, Lasobras, 2012, L\u00e1zaro, 2012, Maacha, 2013, Bouabdellah et al., 2016, Ikenne et al., 2020), the physicochemical characteristics of ore-forming fluids (En-Naciri, 1995, Essarraj et al., 2005, Dolansky, 2007) and the timing of ore formation relative to the main tectonic events in the region (Clauer, 1976, Leblanc and Billaud, 1982, Gasquet et al., 2005, Dolansky, 2007, Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009, Blein et al., 2014, Bouabdellah et al., 2016, Tourneur et al., 2021).\nThus, the aim of this paper is to shed some light on the formation age of the Co-Ni arsenide ores of the Bou Azzer district as well as on the provenance of ore-forming fluids by means of a Pb, Sr, Nd and S isotope survey on a representative set of samples from different ore deposits and regional lithological units.\n\n\n2\nGeology and ore deposits of the Bou Azzer district\nThe Moroccan Anti-Atlas belt, separated from the High Atlas to the North by the South Atlas Fault, is constituted by several inliers of Precambrian units within Late Ediacaran and younger units (\u00c1lvaro et al., 2014, Soulaimani et al, 2018; Table 1\n). One of these inliers, the Bou Azzer-El Gr\u00e2ara inlier (Fig. 1\n) is structurally the most complex portion of the whole Anti-Atlas (Leblanc, 1981). The oldest formation located in the south-eastern part of the Bou Azzer inlier is made up of gneisses, pegmatites, schists, tholeiitic basalts, quartzites and carbonates. Such basement lithologies have been assigned to a Paleoproterozoic suite of rocks by Leblanc (1981); however, new U-Pb dating data for rocks gathered under the name Tachdamt Bleida group, and Tazegzaout group in Bou Azzer demonstrate Tonian and Early Cryogenian ages (900\u2013700\u00a0Ma; Clauer, 1976, D\u2019Lemos et al., 2006, Blein et al., 2014, Hefferan et al., 2014, Bouougri et al., 2020, Triantafyllou et al., 2020). In the North East Bou Azzer inlier outcrop a complex tectonic assemblage made up of metagreywackes and arc-related basalts, andesites, rhyolites and tuffs has been grouped under the name Tichinbanine Ben Lagrad group, and dated between 761\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma and 767\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma (Blein et al., 2014, Triantafyllou et al., 2018, 2020). An important Cryogenian terrane is defined by the Bou Azzer Group, which includes a mafic\u2013ultramafic complex (serpentinized peridotites containing podiform chromitites, layered gabbros, pillow lavas, diabase dykes and associated sedimentary rocks), interpreted by Leblanc (1981) as an ophiolite sequence. The above formations were intruded by syn- to post-kinematic stocks: syn-orogenic (640\u2013660\u00a0Ma) quartz-diorite (Mrini, 1993, Samson et al., 2004, Inglis et al., 2003, El Hadi et al., 2010, Blein et al., 2014, Triantafyllou et al., 2020) and post-orogenic (594\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma) gabbrodiorite (Inglis et al., 2004, Blein et al., 2014). All the above formations were thrusted and folded during the Pan-African orogeny and were unconformably overlain by the molassic Tiddiline Group, the Ediacaran volcanoclastic pile (e.g. ignimbrites, andesites, conglomerates, sandstones dated at 606\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma; Blein et al., 2014), the Ouarzazate Supergroup (567\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma and 566\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma; Blein et al., 2014) and the lower Cambrian Taroudant Group (541\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0Ma; Blein et al., 2014). According to Gasquet et al. (2005) a regional N\u2013S shortening that occurred during the Variscan orogeny reactivated the major Pan-African faults.\nMost Co\u2013Ni\u2013Fe arsenide (\u00b1Au\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Ag) deposits are structurally controlled and distributed along the boundaries of the serpentinite massifs which display vertical contacts with the quartz diorites and locally Ediacaran volcanic rocks of the Ouarzazate Group (Tourneur et al., 2021). From the west to the east (Fig. 1), the studied deposits are: Mechoui, Filon 7\/5, Aghbar, Tamdrost, Ambed, Ightem, Agoudal, and A\u00eft-Ahmane. Co-Ni-Fe ores in the Bou Azzer inlier display variable shapes: trans-tensional, sub-vertical fault-jogs, flame-shaped orebodies, flat lensoidal and pocket-like masses, lodes, veins, veinlets, cemented breccias within veins, and fillings. Further, ores occur in various settings as: i) veins and lodes with sharp wall-rocks along the contacts between serpentinites and other rocks. Locally, arsenide mineralization may extend into serpentinite and quartz diorite wall rocks for 10\u00a0m or more (En-Naciri, 1995, Levresse, 2001, El Ghorfi, 2006, Dolansky, 2007, Maacha, 2013, Tourneur et al., 2021); ii) veins and irregular replacement bodies hosted by serpentinites with diffuse, gradational contacts with the host (Hajjar et al. 2021); iii) mineralized veins secant to this contact, hosted mainly in quartz-diorite and rhyolite from the Ouarzazate group (En-Naciri, 1995, Levresse, 2001, El Ghorfi, 2006, Dolansky, 2007, Maacha, 2013, Tourneur et al., 2021). The mineralized structures of the Bou Azzer cobalt district can be grouped into four main directions. E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE and N-S. No consistent paragenetic sequence can be defined owing to multiple overlapping pulses of mineralization; nevertheless, according to Maacha (2013) and Bouabdellah et al. (2016) the sequence of mineral deposition shows three main stages: (I) the early pre-arsenide stage composed by gold, quartz, chlorite, muscovite and calcite, (II) the Co\u2013, Ni-, Fe-rich main arsenide and sulfarsenide stage and (III) an epithermal stage marked by the precipitation of sulfides associated to late quartz and calcite. Mineralogy and micro-textures of stage II (En-Naciri, 1995, Dolansky, 2007, Ahmed et al., 2009, Gervilla et al., 2012, Lasobras, 2012, L\u00e1zaro, 2012) allow a subdivision into three sub-stages (Fig. 2\n): (IIa) precipitation of arsenide ores starting with the formation of Ni-rich ores including nickeline, rammelsbergite, Ni-rich skutterudite, members of the rammelsbergite-safflorite-l\u00f6llingite solid solution series and sulfarsenides (gersdorffite and minor cobaltite), (IIb) formation of Co-Fe rich ore assemblages made up of Co-rich skutterudite, Co-Ni-Fe diarsenides deeply evolving from Co\u2013 and Ni-rich compositions to the l\u00f6llingite corner of the rammelsbergite-safflorite-l\u00f6llingite ternary system, members of the safflorite-l\u00f6llingite solid solution series and cobaltite, and (IIc) precipitation of Fe-Co rich ores composed of a third generation of skutterudite, safflorite, l\u00f6llingite, cobaltite, alloclasite, arsenopyrite and molybdenite that may evolve locally to nearly monomineralic l\u00f6llingite ores (Hajjar et al., 2021). It also needs to be mentioned that gold and silver are highly concentrated in some ore zones (Bouabdellah et al., 2016), and that a post-ore supergene stage comprising rare arsenides and arsenates is characterizing the upper parts of mineralized structures.\nInformation on the nature of ore-forming fluids comes from a few fluid inclusion studies performed on the Bou Azzer ores (En-Naciri, 1995, Essarraj et al., 2005, Dolansky, 2007) and from some C, O and H isotopic data (Dolansky, 2007, Maacha et al., 2015). The obtained results are controversial. En-Naciri (1995) reported fluid inclusions of pre- and post-ore quartz and post-ore calcite containing moderate to highly saline fluids (15\u201322\u00a0wt% NaCl and 16.5\u201320.5\u00a0wt% CaCl2) trapped at low temperatures (120\u2013240\u00a0\u00b0C) under variable pressures (0.4\u20131.2\u00a0kb) in both pre-ore quartz and post-ore calcite. Essarraj et al. (2005) described a Co-Fe-As ore related with a late stage of Ag-Hg characterized by fluid inclusions with large halite crystals indicative of hyper-saline Na-Ca brines (16\u201324\u00a0wt% NaCl and 21\u201323\u00a0wt% CaCl2) trapped at lower temperatures (120\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C) under a pressure range of 40\u201380\u00a0MPa. In contrast Dolansky (2007) found highly saline brines (31\u201342\u00a0wt% NaCl and 6\u201313\u00a0wt% CaCl2) trapped at relatively high temperature (298\u2013409\u00a0\u00b0C) under relatively high pressures (1.6\u20132.5\u00a0kb) in primary inclusions in pre-ore quartz. Dolansky (2007) also determined the salinity of secondary fluid inclusions (36\u201345\u00a0wt% NaCl and 13\u201326\u00a0wt% CaCl2) in pre-ore quartz and of primary fluid inclusions in post-ore calcite (15.5\u201319.1\u00a0wt% NaCl and 20.9\u201321.5\u00a0wt% CaCl2). She considered the high salinity, the homogenization temperature (164\u2013290\u00a0\u00b0C) and trapping pressure (0.88\u20131.4\u00a0kb) of the former as representative of the ore-forming fluids. The lower salinity, temperature (\u2265200\u00a0\u00b0C) and pressure (\u223c0.65\u00a0kb) of the inclusions in post-ore calcite indicate decreasing P-T trapping conditions over the course of mineral deposition. Maacha et al. (2015) and Dolansky (2007) also measured \u03b418O and \u03b4D in quartz separates and a chlorite sample obtaining values of the precipitating fluids ranging from 7.9 to 9.6\u2030 \u03b418O and from \u221262 to \u221230\u2030 \u03b4D with little variations among samples or deposits. These data were interpreted as signatures of magmatic water, whereas Maacha et al. (2015), on the basis of \u03b413C (from \u22121.61 to \u22126.5\u2030) and \u03b418Ofluid values (from \u22126.3 to 5.9\u2030) values in Bou Azzer calcite and dolomite, argued for the presence of exogenic water in the formation of the associated arsenide ore.\nPublished sulfur isotope data are scarce (Dolansky, 2007, Maacha et al., 2015) and hardly representative for the main ore-forming event as they provide a set of scattered \u03b434S data from \u201332.3 to 9.9\u2030 obtained from galena, pyrite and chalcopyrite pertaining to the late epithermal stage.\nCrosscutting and offsetting relationships led Leblanc and Billaud (1982) to conclude that all the orebodies postdate the serpentinization and the structures of the major Pan-African tectonic phase during which ophiolite obduction and greenschist metamorphism took place (685\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0Ma; Rb\/Sr, Clauer, 1976; 660-640\u00a0Ma, Blein et al., 2014). Leblanc and Billaud (1982) also observed that the main orebodies are located along transcurrent sinistral faults belonging to the ultimate Pan-African phase, between 615 and 580\u00a0Ma ago. Therefore, they did not rule out that this time relate to mineralization events in the district. Bouabdellah et al. (2016) argued that the Bou Azzer mineralization is younger than the emplacement of the trachytic sills dated at 531\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma (U\u2013Pb SIMS zircon ages) by Gasquet et al. (2005). A number of other radiometric studies aimed to date mineralization have yielded highly variable ages, from about 400\u00a0Ma down to 32\u00a0Ma, and their significance will be further discussed below. To sum up, a complex, telescoped and polymetallic (Co\u2013Ni\u2013As\u2013Fe\u2013Cu\u2013Au\u2013Ag) mineral district appears to be the result of late Pan-African and Variscan deformations and recrystallizations.\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical techniques\nSpecimens for microscopy and isotope investigations have been gathered from 5 Co-Ni deposits in the Bou Azzer area (Table 2\n). In particular, the study has mainly focused on three deposits (Fig. 3\nA-C); Tamdrost, Aghbar and A\u00eft-Ahmane which are shortly described below as well as two other deposits (Filon 7\/5 and Ightem) from which several samples were analysed for S isotopes. In addition, an examination of polished sections from Mechoui, Ambed and Agoudal added further support to the view that ores of the Bou Azzer district share a number of common features, such as a structural control and variable ore settings. Representative ore textures from some selected ores are shown in Fig. 4\n.\nAccording to Maacha et al. (2015) the Tamdrost type ore bodies located at the discordant contact of serpentinites with felsic volcanic rocks of the Ouarzazate group are represented by veins and lenses filling fractures of extension and compression. A supergene alteration zone in serpentinite is the main ore-bearing structure hosting orebodies with maximum thickness at the contact of altered serpentinite.\n\nMaacha et al. (2015) also show that the altered serpentinite is hosting ore veins at Aghbar that are related to synchronous fracturing and the ore body is restricted to the flanks of a serpentinite dome structure, whereas Dolansky (2007) pointed out that the mineralized structure at Aghbar is a broadly sub horizontal contact orebody with a concave-down form draped over the serpentinite massif. The structure is commonly described as a complex shell, owing to numerous subvertical lenses referred to as flamelike structures, attributed to the Hercynian deformations (Leblanc, 1975).\nA\u00eft-Ahmane does not refer to a single deposit but to an area in the easternmost part of the district where several ore veins are\/were mined. The mineralization at A\u00eft-Ahmane has been described as a \u201ccontact mineralization\u201d that is hosted by lenses of calcified serpentinite located at the contact between serpentinite and quartz diorite or gabbro (En-Naciri, 1995) and as massive to disseminated bodies fully hosted by serpentinite (Hajjar et al., 2021). The former ore, taking the shape of disseminated, minute spherical aggregates, occurs essentially as an infilling in dissolution cavities within a mixture of clastic and chemical sediments. The latter ore fills intraserpentinite faults extending outwards through the fault walls filling small entwined veins and partly replacing serpentinite (Hajjar et al., 2021). These authors pointed out that serpentinite-hosted ores are atypical in that they are mainly formed by Fe diarsenides (l\u00f6llingite) with very low Ni and Co contents. Mineral textures show that ore-forming fluids partly have dissolved serpentine and, subsequently, precipitated Fe-rich arsenide ores.\nVarious types of samples have been analysed for their (Pb, Sr, Nd and S) isotopic and geochemical signatures. The fine-grained nature of the ores poses a challenge during the stage of sample selection for (S and Pb) isotope analyses. The di-, tri-arsenide and sulfarsenide minerals from different depositional stages, and encompassing all morphological types, were selectively sampled from polished sections by using a rotatory tool (DremelTM) equipped with LascoTM 1.58\u00a0mm and 2.38\u00a0mm diamond core drills. As a complement, a few course Bou Azzer ore samples were also taken from the mineral collection of the Swedish Museum of Natural History. These specimens allowed separation of enough material for doing Sr-Nd isotope work, but their exact locality is not known. Regional rocks were selected to encompass plausible source rocks of mineralizing components at the time of ore formation.\nBefore the Sr-Nd-Pb-isotope ratio measurements, minerals and whole rock samples were spiked with a mixed 147Sm\/150Nd spike solution (a mixed 84Sr-87Rb spike was also added to museum ore samples aimed for Rb-Sr analysis) and digested in nitric acid and a HF-HClO4 acid mixture, respectively. Initially, dissolved samples went through an ion exchange column set-up using a mixture of TrueSpec\u00ae of AG1x8 resins. Sr was further purified in a second pass through the same columns now filled with SrSpec\u00ae resin, whereas Nd (and Sm) was isolated in Ln-spec columns (Pin and Zalduegui, 1997). The Pb fractions were re-dissolved in HBr, and treated further in columns with AG1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08, Cl\u2212 form resin.\nA Thermo-Finnigan Triton thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) instrument was used for the Sr and Nd isotope analyses and data were normalized to 88Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.1194 and 146Nd\/144Nd\u00a0=\u00a00.7219, respectively. Additionally, replicate analyses of the NBS-987 Sr standard analyzed during the course of the study yielded an average 87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.710221\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000011 (2\u03c3 external precision). Corresponding analyses of the La Jolla Nd standard yielded an average 143Nd\/144Nd\u00a0=\u00a00.511848\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000009 (2\u03c3 external precision). Estimated external uncertainties amount to ca.\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00005 for the calculated \u03b5Nd and Sr initial isotope values, respectively. Pb isotope analyses were performed with a Nu Plasma II ICP-MS instrument (hosted by the Vegacenter facility), with Tl added to allow for an internal correction of the mass bias, and the measured intensities were corrected for background and Hg interference on mass 204. The NBS-981 Pb standard was run at regular intervals and all unknowns were analyzed in duplicate. The obtained values for the standard are within error of those given by Todt et al. (1996), and the external reproducibility is between 0.04% (206Pb\/204Pb) and 0.08% (208Pb\/204Pb).\nSulfur isotope analyses were performed at the Laboratorio de Is\u00f3topos Estables (University of Salamanca, Spain). Sulfur isotopic ratios of arsenide and sulfarsenide minerals were obtained by pyrolysis on an Elemental Analyzer (Eurovector EA3000) coupled on line with an Isoprime (Micromass) continuous flow mass spectrometer. The SO2 liberated by standard stable isotopic extraction techniques (Coleman and Moore, 1978) was analyzed using a dedicated SITA-II (VGIsogas) dual inlet mass spectrometer. Due to the small SO2 quantities produced in both methods, V2O5 was added to favour combustion.\nSulfur from regional rocks was separated using a chemical extraction technique based on the works of Canfield et al. (1986) and Hall et al. (1988), with modifications as described by Recio et al. (1991). Results are reported in the standard delta per mil notation relative to Canyon Diablo Troilite (CDT). Replicate analysis of reference standards gave an average reproducibility of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u2030.\nElement concentrations of whole rock samples were determined at Intertek Laboratories (Australia). Sample preparation was performed by four acid digestion offering a near total dissolution of all mineral species. All elements were analyzed by combined ICP-OES and ICP-MS methods for ultra-trace levels under the control of certified international standards. Further details on the latter, as well as calibration, detection limits, etc., can be found at \nhttp:\/\/www.intertek.com\/minerals\n.\n\n\n4\nResults\nOre samples were analyzed mainly for their lead and sulfur isotope composition, and for a few of these also Sr and Nd isotope analyses were carried out. Further, to establish the source of metals in nearby Bou Azzer ores, radiogenic (Pb-Sr-Nd) isotope data, along with some S isotope analyses and geochemical results, have been acquired from a suite of potential source rocks. Most of the sampled rocks are Neoproterozoic, comprising either a Cryogenian ophiolitic suite or are sedimentary, volcano-sedimentary and granitic rocks of a similar age (Table 1). Others formed during the Ediacaran period.\n\n4.1\nPb isotopes:\nThe results of Pb-isotope analysis of twenty-four ore samples and nineteen regional rock samples are given in Tables 3 and 4\n\n and presented on conventional Pb-isotope diagrams in Figs. 5 and 6\n\n. 206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios of the arsenide and sulfide ores cover a wide range between 15.79 and 56.93, 15.13\u201317.71 and 34.85\u201338.66, respectively. One l\u00f6llingite sample (#1643\/10) from Tamdrost has a remarkably unradiogenic composition (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.79), and an arsenopyrite sample (#819) from Aghbar has also a deviating, unradiogenic composition (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a016.71). Another outstanding feature is that a significant number of ore samples from the Aghbar and Tamdrost deposits are strongly radiogenic and tend to define linear uranogenic trends with relatively flat slopes (Fig. 5A, inset). Other ore samples display a relatively limited data variation with e.g. 206Pb\/204Pb between ca 17.9 and 18.1, but since this group of samples show a significant range in their 207Pb\/204Pb ratios for a given 206Pb\/204Pb ratio it becomes somewhat ambiguous to tell exactly which samples define the flat trends. Yet, if such trends are interpreted as isochrones originating from an approximative bulk ore signature, and by excluding two Tamdrost (1643\/34 and 1643\/10) and three of the Aghbar samples (724, 819 l\u00f6ll and 1026) plotting below reasonable arrays, their slopes suggest ages at 392\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a03.2) and 400\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0150\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a030) for Aghbar (n\u00a0=\u00a010 samples) and Tamdrost (n\u00a0=\u00a06), respectively. A combined regression involving Aghbar and Tamdrost samples yields an age of 382\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052 (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a012). Although there is a clear variation in 207Pb\/204Pb data from the A\u00eft-Ahmane deposit (206Pb\/204Pb close to 18.0) that exceeds the analytical precision, the compositional range is narrower compared to the other deposits, although this could be the result of the restricted number of samples collected from this deposit (Table 3). The thorogenic lead systematics of ore minerals (Fig. 5B) seem also quite complex given that a range of specimens have significantly radiogenic, and variable, 206Pb\/204Pb in combination with comparatively low 208Pb\/204Pb, in consistency with very low apparent Th\/U ratios of these minerals. The remaining ore minerals cluster in a comparatively unradiogenic region and tend to form a crude linear, steep array.\nRocks of the ophiolite suite (e.g. gabbro and serpentinite) and associated rocks (e.g. Qz-diorite and rodingite) have relatively unradiogenic compositions with 206Pb\/204Pb between ca. 18.0 and 18.4 (Table 4) that are similar to, or slightly more radiogenic, than the bulk of ore data. However, in analogy with the situation for some ore specimens, data for certain rock samples span a large Pb isotope interval (Fig. 6). The extreme values are defined by an unradiogenic composition of a pegmatite (T-pegm; 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.49) and radiogenic data for a dolomite (WB-Dol; 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.25), respectively. There is no systematic isotope pattern to be seen if the inferred stratigraphic ages for different rocks are taken into account; yet, e.g. the composition of the T-peg sample would argue for an Early Proterozoic time of emplacement. Tentatively, certain rock data form crude linear arrays in the uranogenic diagram (Fig. 6A), but their significance is not obvious as further discussed below. With regard to the thorogenic lead, rock data tend to develop an array defining a steep slope (stippled line in Fig. 6B) and the bulk ore composition plots close to this array whose end-members are defined by basement rocks. As also noted for the ore minerals, there is a tendency for a few rocks to show high 206Pb\/204Pb ratios but without correspondingly elevated 208Pb\/204Pb values.\n\n\n4.2\nSr isotopes:\nOnly a few Rb-Sr analyses were carried out on museum ore specimens; two skutterudite, one erythrite and one carbonate. The obtained 87Sr\/86Sr values are quite homogeneous and close to 0.710 (Table 5\n). The calculation of their initial Sr isotope values is not obvious to carry out since the age of mineralization is still a debated issue. However, the obtained Rb\/Sr ratios are generally low implying that the back-calculation to a desired time(s) of ore formation is not critically dependent on the exact age. By using an average ore mineralization age of 350\u00a0Ma (see discussion below), the calculated initial values of ore minerals fall between 0.709 and 0.710 (Table 5). A first order approximation suggests these values to be a good estimate of the strontium isotope signature carried by Bou Azzer ore-forming solutions.\nRock data, on the other hand, are more heterogeneous which is an expected feature given that the data set involves rocks of different ages and origin and data scatter a lot in a conventional Rb-Sr isochron diagram (not shown). Partly, the scatter may be due to possible disturbances of the Rb-Sr system which in turn would affect calculated initial Sr isotope compositions. Such compositions, calculated using the inferred emplacement ages tabulated in Table 5, are between 0.7019 and 0.7060 for the dolomite, the rhyolite, a Qz-diorite and three rocks (serpentinite, dunite and gabbro) believed to belong to the ophiolite suite. No Sr concentration data is available for the analyzed clinopyroxenite (OPH-cpx3); however, its Rb concentration is low (0.29\u00a0ppm) and knowing that clinopyroxene is usually a Ca-rich phase (by inference also with an elevated Sr content) it is suggested that the initial Sr isotope composition is close to the measured value of 0.7107. Knowing that the Rb-Sr system is susceptible to isotopic disturbances induced by metamorphic and hydrothermal processes one should treat initial values, whether calculated for an emplacement age or a mineralization age, with caution. This uncertainty is further accentuated by the question mark regarding the emplacement ages of some rocks (see discussion) and also by the calculated initial value of ca. 0.7025 for the analyzed carbonate rock of the\u00a0\u223c\u00a0789\u00a0Ma Tachdamt-Bleida group which is well below that of contemporaneous seawater (0.7068, Asmerom et al., 1991). Probably, this reactive type of sample has also suffered some kind of disturbance, or carries minute inclusions of potassium-rich clay minerals, which is supported by its unusually high 87Rb\/86Sr ratio of 0.656.\n\n\n4.3\nNd isotopes:\nThe analyses of five ore samples (two carbonates, two skutterudites and one erythrite) yielded highly variable results (Table 6\n). The spiking procedure turned out to be a major problem and the reason is probably the presence of variable amounts of REE-rich inclusions, such as brannerite, in the analyzed minerals which led to both over- and underspiked sample mixtures. Therefore, ore mineral results must be treated with caution and the calculated span of \u0190Nd (ore, 350\u00a0Ma) values between \u22126.5 and 11 is highly uncertain. The analyses of rocks involved eleven samples and obtained Nd isotope compositions and calculated parameter values are shown in Table 6 and displayed on Fig. 7\n. \u0190Nd values were calculated both for an inferred emplacement age (using ages in Table 1) and an ore event at 350\u00a0Ma. \u0190Nd (658\u00a0Ma) values for rocks of the ophiolite suite, except for the serpentinite (B1 serp) yielding a negative value, have values between 3.06 and 5.05 that are similar, or slightly lower, than published data of similar rocks (D\u2019Lemos et al., 2006). Also, an andesitic tuff (Age-1), and a quartz-diorite (Qz-Di6) have similar values, whereas data for other rocks (pegmatite, volcanic sediment, rhyolite, orthogneiss and carbonate) have more variable and negative values. At the time of the inferred 350\u00a0Ma ore-forming event, negative \u0190Nd values characterize most rocks except for the quartz-diorite, the andesitic tuff (Age-1) and the ophiolitic rock types (except B1 serp.).\n\n\n4.4\nS isotopes:\nThe S isotope study includes in-situ analyses of ore stage samples from Filon 7\/5 and Ightem in addition to samples from those three deposits (Aghbar, Tamdrost and A\u00eft-Ahmane) for which Pb isotope data exist (Table 7\n). The results are the first-ever S isotope analysis obtained from minor amounts of sulfur contained in arsenides and sulfarsenides. The set of analyzed samples covers the three sub-stages in which the main Co\u2013, Ni-, Fe-rich arsenide and sulfarsenide stage (stage II; Bouabdellah et al., 2016) can be subdivided: Ni-Co dominant (IIa), Co-Fe dominant (IIb) and Fe-Co dominant (IIc). The heterogeneous impression yielded by the relatively few published S isotope data obtained from the post-ore, epithermal stage (a \u03b434S range from\u00a0+\u00a010 to \u201332 \u2030; Maacha et al., 2015, Dolansky, 2007) is reinforced by the new data from the main ore-forming stage. The entire \u03b434S data range defined by thirty-six stage II specimens is from\u00a0+\u00a011.2 to \u201322.5 \u2030, with no easily discernible distinction between data representing different ores and different sub-stages (Fig. 8\n). For instance, there is a large data spread characterizing both Filon 7\/5 and Aghbar (the range in both cases is more than 22 \u2030, involving both negative and positive values), with a mode fairly close to zero per mille. A\u00eft-Ahmane samples also display a large spread in data, but all numbers are negative, whereas Tamdrost and Ightem (few data) have values clustering around zero. Whenever related data exist from two nearby spots hitting the same mineral (e.g. 759a and 759b gersdorffite in Table 7), a relatively minor isotopic difference is noted although it often exceeds the analytical precision.\nFive analyses correspond to whole rocks representing the ophiolite suite. Apart from one negative value (-2.2\u2030 for a gabbro), the remaining values are clearly positive defining a range between 6.2 and 9.0 \u2030.\n\n\n4.5\nGeochemistry of rocks\nNineteen rocks were analyzed for major and trace elements. The purpose of this work that involves fifthteen rock types taken from outcrops in the vicinity of ore deposits (see Tables 8(A-C)\n\n\n; Fig. 1) was basically to provide basic information about samples also used for isotope analyses. In the current context, it is crucial that selected samples were not affected by post-emplacement ore-bearing fluids in order to enable a meaningful interpretation of isotope data of rocks and their possible role as sources of ore elements. For instance, although the Co contents in two samples also used for isotope work (B1, serpentinite; 197\u00a0ppm and OPH-Dun4 dunite; 130\u00a0ppm) are much higher than in remaining samples (Table 8B), these numbers are not especially high in comparison with average Co concentrations in ultramafic rocks in general (110\u00a0ppm; Stueber and Goles, 1967) and with previous ophiolite data from Bou Azzer (Hajjar et al., 2021). Hence, there is little evidence to suggest that samples used for isotope work have suffered an isotopic over-printing effect in relation to the ore-forming event(s). However, it is less certain that e.g. the Rb-Sr isotope whole-rock system has stayed closed ever since the time of rock crystallization given that e.g. volcanic rocks of the ophiolite suite were affected by regional metamorphism, obduction-related metamorphism and basalt-seawater interaction (Naidoo et al., 1991). Geochemical Rb, Sr, U, Th and Pb concentrations were also used for calculating initial Sr and Pb isotope compositions both at the inferred time of rock emplacement and that of ore formation.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nPublished field, mineralogical, petrological, fluid inclusion and isotopic data indicate that ore depositional conditions have varied across the Bou Azzer district. Although our study is focused on only three, geographically spread out, ores (Tamdrost, Aghbar and A\u00eft-Ahmane), these ores share features in different types of isotope (Pb, Sr and Nd) diagrams, as further discussed below. This is suggesting that elements in different deposits have a similar origin and that the conclusions drawn thus have a regional significance. The radiogenic isotope systematics are clearly complex for rocks and minerals analyzed from the sampled ores in this study; however, it is still possible to use isotopic, mineralogical and field information to constrain the sources of ore components, and to discuss the timing and general processes leading to ore formation. Two features are of outmost importance for controlling radiogenic (Pb, Nd and Sr) isotope systematics pertinent to ore-forming conditions; assimilation of probably both sedimentary cover rocks and basement rocks during Neoproterozoic magma formation and the common incorporation of (U- and REE-bearing) brannerite inclusions in arsenides and sulfarsenides, and related in-situ growth of radiogenic lead isotopes ever since ore mineral formation.\n\n5.1\nLead isotope constraints on the ore-forming conditions\nThe lead isotope systematics of ore minerals and rocks show some unusual features involving e.g. highly evolved isotopic compositions and linear data trends having different slopes. These features will form the basis for discussing two main aspects; the age of the ores and the source of ore lead. It is suggested here that the variable lead isotopes of Bou Azzer minerals reflect both in-situ decay and source mixing effects and their respective influence on data becomes ambiguous. This implies that in order to assign values of e.g. the average ore lead composition, the influence of these two processes must be clarified and this is best done by examining the total data set derived from the three studied ores.\n\nIn-situ decay and the age of ores: Not much is known about the tendency for common Ni and Co arsenides to incorporate U and Th in their lattices, a process governing an in-situ growth of the radiogenic lead isotopes. Yet, this tendency is probably marginal given the small ionic radius of the cations in relation to the large size of uranium and thorium ions. Arsenopyrite, on the other hand, is a phase known to mimic a true common lead mineral (i.e. having very low U\/Pb and Th\/Pb ratios). Nonetheless, one arsenopyrite analysis (#726) yielded exceptional high 206Pb\/204Pb ratios (Table 3), whereas another arsenopyrite (#819) plots far away from other samples in the Pb-Pb diagrams. Arsenopyrite is a late phase of the main arsenide stage (stage II) and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the radiogenicity of arsenopyrite #726 is controlled by the presence of U-rich mineral inclusions. Such inclusions, dominated by brannerite (UTi2O6) have been recognized in e.g skutterudite from the Bou Azzer area (Dolansky, 2007, this study). Following this, it is reasonable to suggest that also other arsenides and sulfarsenides with elevated 206Pb\/204Pb observed from Tamdrost and Aghbar obtained their radiogenic signature due to the presence of such inclusions. An in-situ U-Pb decay effect active ever since ore mineral formation will primarily affect the 206Pb\/204Pb ratio and to a much less degree the 207Pb\/204Pb ratio, implying that samples with a significant content of brannerite will be displaced along a flat slope towards the radiogenic end. The slope of the straight line, connecting mineral samples from different deposits in Fig. 5A, is not well constrained although an age in the 300\u2013400\u00a0Ma time span is indicated. The age of ore formation remains a debated issue, and e.g. independent dating of brannerite and also molybdenite (Dolansky, 2007, Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009) have yielded\u00a0\u2264\u00a0400\u00a0Ma ages which are comparable to the combined Aghbar and Tamdrost Pb-Pb age of 382\u00a0\u00b1\u00a056\u00a0Ma (this study). Other age estimates are close to 310\u00a0Ma (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009). As it appears possible that mineralization ages vary across the district, we choose an intermediate value of 350\u00a0Ma for the purpose of setting an approximate age of district-scale ore formation. This model age corresponds to a slope value of 0.0542 (see the stippled lines in Fig. 5A) and the least radiogenic ore samples along this slope (i.e. those which are least affected by in-situ decay effects) have 206Pb\/204Pb values between 17.9 and 18.0 and are defined by a group of four samples involving Aghbar #1026 skutterudite; Tamdrost #1551 l\u00f6llingite; and A\u00eft-Ahmane #999b and 2415 l\u00f6llingite.\n\nMixing: The group of unradiogenic samples with comparatively constrained 206Pb\/204Pb around 18 (Fig. 5A), which is defined by specimens from all three studied deposits, can be assumed not have been significantly influenced by in-situ decay processes. Hence, such values should represent essentially undisturbed ore lead signatures since ore formation; yet, there is a substantial variation of about 0.4 units in 207Pb\/204Pb developed for these samples. A probable explanation to deviating 207Pb\/204Pb values is an incomplete mixing mechanism involving ore sources with contrasting isotopic compositions. This finds support from the steep trends noted in the thorogenic diagram (Fig. 5B) for the considered group of samples. Such trends cannot result from the presence of brannerite inclusions (known to have very low Th\/U values of about 0.0025 in the Bou Azzer area; Dolansky, 2007) as this would lead to markedly high 206Pb\/204Pb ratios but not very elevated 208Pb\/204Pb values. To sum up, the steeply aligned 207Pb-206Pb and 208Pb-206Pb isotope patterns at the low-radiogenic end of the data spectrum are probably an effect of mineralizing fluids acquiring lead from isotopically distinct sources.\n\nAverage ore lead: Given the noted ore lead isotope variability, and the existence of probable mixing effects, it is likely that no unique lead isotope signature represents the entire ore district. Rather, it is meaningful to try and define an average type of ore lead, and it was previously proposed that four unradiogenic samples could approximate the bulk ore lead in the district having a 206Pb\/204Pb ratio of ca 17.9. The complementary 207Pb\/206Pb and 208Pb\/206Pb ratios can be derived from the relationships between the group of least radiogenic ore samples and the radiogenic samples displayed in Fig. 5. Leaving out five samples with extreme compositions (Tamdrost #1643\/https:\/\/doi.org\/10,1643\/34 and Aghbar #819, 724 and 1026), the data of which will be shown not to reflect typical arsenide and sulfarsenide ore-forming conditions, the tentative flat trends aligning a large number of samples from Tamdrost and Aghbar, are actually passing near the field of unradiogenic data with 206Pb\/204Pb close to 17.9. This adds support to the idea that the bulk of ore samples crystallized with this 206Pb\/204Pb value; some of them (free from U-rich inclusions) are still reflecting this signature, whereas others (carrying inclusions) evolved with time and at the present time, their values define a flat slope in Fig. 5A. The intersection between the flat trend and the unradiogenic sample cluster define an average 207Pb\/204Pb value of around 15.55. We are suggesting that the uranogenic 17.9\/15.55 composition corresponds to a general situation where two or more end-components were thoroughly mixed prior to mineral deposition giving rise to an ore lead component typical of the Bou Azzer district (Fig. 5). By analogy, the appropriate (thorogenic) 208Pb\/204Pb value, set by the group of samples with matching 206Pb\/204Pb and 207Pb\/204Pb values close to 17.9 and 15.55, is close to 38, or slightly lower (Fig. 5B). Hence, in further modelling, we will refer to an average type of ore lead with 206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb at 17.9\/15.55\/37.9, respectively. By applying Stacey and Kramers (1975) two-stage model for terrestrial lead isotope evolution, this average lead composition yields a model age of about 440\u00a0Ma and a related my-value (238U\/204Pb) of 9.58.\n\n\n5.2\nSource(s) of lead in ore fluids\nTwo samples can be distinguished as defining the previously outlined mixing array(s); Tamdrost #1643\/10 (contains a marked proportion of an unradiogenic source; low in 207Pb), and A\u00eft-Ahmane #999 (contains a significant amount of a more radiogenic source; high in 207Pb). Tentatively, these samples reflect a binary mixing process involving two isotopically, rather well-defined end-members existing at the approximate time (350\u00a0Ma) of ore formation. Although this is probably an oversimplification, their isotopic compositions can still be used to discuss the nature of rocks that delivered the lead component to the ores. Fig. 9\n shows calculated lead isotope compositions of potential source rocks at 350\u00a0Ma and, with respect to a proposed mixing array, three rock types are relevant to discuss further; 1) an inferred basement, 2) ophiolites and 3) sedimentary rocks.\n\n\nBasement-Pb:\n Two ore minerals, #819 arsenopyrite and #1643\/10 l\u00f6llingite, and some rocks have 206Pb\/204Pb values less than 17 (Fig. 5A) that are isotopically less evolved than lead typically existing during Neoproterozoic or Devonian-Carboniferous times. Although a much older formation age cannot completely be ruled out, the favored explanation is that Hercynian tectonic processes led to an incorporation of a very significant (#1643\/10) to significant (#819) basement component characterized by unradiogenic lead that has resided in an environment with very low Th\/Pb and U\/Pb ratios. The analyzed pegmatite (T-pegm) has an extremely low 206Pb\/204Pb value of about 15.5 which argues for an old emplacement age. The lead in this rock is mostly contained in K-feldspar that is a comparatively lead-rich phase and also considered to be a common Pb mineral (with a very low U\/Pb concentration ratio) that keeps its primary magmatic composition intact over time. Therefore, this rock type is an obvious supplier of a distinctly unradiogenic component to an evolving ore-forming fluid, and its extremely unradiogenic composition implies that this rock must have formed in the early Proterozoic. From this it is inferred that there are old basement rocks present in the Bou Azzer-El Gr\u00e2ara inlier which contributed ore lead to the Ni-Co deposits. Tentatively, the analyzed orthogneiss (T-ORGN) is also early Proterozoic and may have formed from a similar magma source as the pegmatite, but its lead isotope composition changed moderately over time due to in-situ decay of uranium (and thorium) fixed in phases like biotite and amphibole. Supporting this is the\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.8\u00a0Ga reference line drawn to connect the pegmatite and orthogneiss data points in Fig. 6A. Such an age is similar to detrital zircon ages obtained from sediments sampled in the same region (Bouougri et al., 2020; Lahna et al., 2020).\n\nOphiolite-Pb: Whereas a basement component is probably not commonly available and therefore more rarely involved in ore-forming processes, the Upper Cryogenian ophiolite sequence of rocks is clearly spatially associated with Co-Ni ore deposits. Given that also a number of ophiolitic rocks have a lead isotope composition (at 350\u00a0Ma) that quite well matches the average ore lead composition (cf. Fig. 9) is a strong evidence for a genetic connection as well. Ultramafic rocks (such as dunites and pyroxenites) are quite low in lead (Faure, 1986), and possibly serpentinites that often are intimately associated with ore-bearing structures have been the dominant ophiolitic rock type supplying lead, as well as Co and Ni (Hajjar et al., 2021), to the ores. Qz-diorite is another rock type with a common spatial relationship to ores. Noting that both analyzed samples of this type had an initial (350\u00a0Ma) Pb isotope composition that plots relatively close to \u201caverage\u201d ore lead (Fig. 9), therefore this rock type may indeed have supplied part of the lead.\n\nSediment-Pb: As also the analyzed Tiddiline rock shows a good match with average ore lead as seen from a comparison (at t\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0Ma) in both the 207Pb-206Pb (Fig. 9) and 208Pb-206Pb diagrams, clastic rocks should also be considered as a supplier of ore lead. Carbonates are reactive and prone to interact with invading hot fluids, but the details of this suggested process are not clear and the significance of the highly radiogenic lead isotope composition of the analyzed carbonate rock (DOL-WB, Table 4) remains obscure. It might also be briefly mentioned that there are some odd lead isotope compositions (with low 207Pb in relation to the content of 206Pb) recognized. For instance, three samples from Aghbar (# 724, 819 and 1026) may be interpreted as containing a significant old common Pb component, similar to that observed for the pegmatite (T-pegm), that controlled the composition attained during mineral deposition; in addition, these samples probably contain brannerite inclusions that over time (350 \u2013 0\u00a0Ma interval) pushed the data points towards more radiogenic compositions (Fig. 5).\nIn summary, it is believed that ore-forming fluids have picked up lead from a range of source rocks with serpentinites and quartz-dioritic rocks as the main suppliers. Besides, basement rocks are likely to have supplied an unradiogenic component, and possibly sediments contributed a minor, more radiogenic (high in 207Pb) type of lead.\n\n\n5.3\nSources of Sr, Nd ore components\n\nSource(s) of strontium in ore fluids: Sr isotope data of ore specimens are relatively few, but it seems that contrary to the Pb (and Nd) isotopes, quite homogeneous 87Sr\/86Sr compositions of around 0.709\u20130.710 (Fig. 10\n, calculated for tore\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0Ma) characterize the strontium contained in arsenides and carbonates. Contrary to the mineral phases, which have low Rb\/Sr element ratios, some rocks show quite elevated Rb contents and since the Rb-Sr system is relatively susceptible to post-crystallization disturbances, back-calculated 87Sr\/86Sr values, both to the time of rock crystallization and to the inferred ore formation (350\u00a0Ma), may become uncertain. This effect is normally insignificant for mafic rocks, known to generally have low Rb\/Sr concentration ratios, and therefore the spread in Sr isotope compositions (350\u00a0Ma) with values as low as 0.7038 for a gabbro and an extreme value above 0.712 for the analyzed serpentinite, is not expected. The elevated value for the serpentinite, featuring an unusually high Rb\/Sr ratio (Table 5), may suggest interaction with crustal fluids as part of the serpentinization process close in time to the magma emplacement, but also e.g. a dunite and a clinopyroxenite have elevated ratios at t\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0Ma.\nGiven the available results, only the analyzed gabbro and the quartz-diorite, with 87Sr\/86Sr values of\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.704 at t\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0Ma, have a strontium isotope composition typical for a rock of a mantle origin. Two hypotheses may be put forward to explain the 87Sr\/86Sr values (t\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0Ma) well above 0.705 for most mafic rocks; one of them is that crustal assimilation during magma generation introduced radiogenic strontium into most magmas. Another possibility, which is in line with the near-deposit location for several of the analyzed rocks and the identified radiogenic strontium in ore-forming fluids, is that evolved mineralizing fluids have interacted with juvenile mafic rocks (87Sr\/86Sr below 0.704). Irrespective of the mechanisms that controlled the strontium isotope signatures in rocks, the isotope range (0.709\u20130.710) indicated for the ultimate fluids depositing ore minerals is suggesting an isotopic exchange between mineralizing fluids and country rocks prior to ore deposition. It is noteworthy that the homogeneous ore strontium values imply that a relatively thorough mixing preceded ore formation. However, such an effect that equalizes contrasts in source end-member compositions is not indicated from lead isotope data. To overcome this apparent discrepancy, it may be that a single, relatively homogeneous source with a high concentration of strontium dominated ore-forming fluids and controlled their Sr isotopic composition.\n\nSource(s) of neodymium in ore fluids: Due to the described problems related to analyses of ore minerals their corrected Nd isotope values, as shown in Fig. 7, are uncertain. More attention can be given to Nd isotope data provided for ore carbonates sampled in three areas across the Bou Azzer district (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009). When calculated for an approximate ore formation age, these values (eps-Nd, t\u00a0=\u00a0350\u00a0Ma) suggest that ore fluids carry neodymium of a highly variable composition, but dominantly with negative eps-Nd values (Fig. 7). Such values are not consistent with a pure origin from a mantle-derived source which is likely to have values near\u00a0+\u00a07 to\u00a0+\u00a08.\nThe Nd isotope data of the analyzed rocks in this study produce a scattered impression when present-day compositions are plotted (Fig. 7). Three ophiolite-type samples (dunite, OPH-cpx3 and the gabbro), the Qz-diorite and the andesitic tuff scatter around a reference line drawn for a 658\u00a0Ma age. These data indicate that certain samples may have originated from a magma source with an approximate\u00a0+\u00a04 eps-Nd value, i.e. not as deleted as expected from a pure mantle-derived melt. A logical implication is that crustal assimilation processes may have affected the magma-generating event leading to deposition of ophiolite-type rocks. Other rock types indicate generally even less positive eps-Nd values, i.e. a formation from a quite evolved magma source. Notably, some rocks (Tak-2a, BW-3, T-ORGN and T-pegm), several of them situated in the region close to the Bleida Far West occurrence (Fig. 1), have more CHUR-like or even enriched \u0190Nd values and their model ages are much older than their emplacement ages (Table 6). The high Nd model ages may be interpreted in two ways; either the rocks are Neoproterozoic and incorporated a very significant old basement component, or they represent truly early Proterozoic magmas. In the absence of new radiometric data, but irrespective of the preferred interpretation, the local existence of an old basement is nevertheless indicated.\nOur interpretation of available data is that ophiolite-related rocks and certain crustal, felsic rocks were involved in the ore-forming processes at 350\u00a0Ma. Fig. 10 is a combined Nd-Sr diagram constructed to illustrate the situation at this time using Nd data for ore carbonates (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009) and Sr data for ore phases and rocks (this study). From the available data, the shaded box constrains possible Nd and Sr isotope values for ore fluids, and clearly the ore fluid composition is not consistent with an origin from a pure juvenile source with a depleted Sr and Nd isotope character. Thus, although ore fluids may have originated from a depleted source, equal to an ophiolite-related component (marked by ophiolite magma? in Fig. 7), it appears that other, isotopically contrasting and evolved sources are required to explain the range in the Sr-Nd isotopic signatures of ore fluids. The available depleted component may be reflected by the mantle-derived gabbro which will be shown to have a magmatic S isotope composition and hence may have escaped an (crustal) assimilation effect. Relatively few isotope data exist for crustal rocks and this inhibits the possibility to quantify crustal assimilation processes and to draw tentative mixing hyperbolas illustrating the possible interaction between different sources and ore fluids. Nonetheless, arrows are to Fig. 10 to simply illustrate that ore-forming fluids likely picked up Sr and Nd from both mantle-derived and crustal rocks in agreement with the conclusion drawn on basis of the lead isotope systematics.\n\n\n5.4\nSource (s) of sulphur in ore fluids\nLike e.g. fluid inclusion and Pb isotope evidence, S isotope data of ore minerals give a complex impression (Fig. 8). Available data cover a range of deposits but neither relatively few data from base metal sulphides (Maacha et al., 2015, Dolansky, 2007) representing a late epithermal mineralization stage (Bouabdellah et al., 2016) nor a more exhaustive data set from the arsenide-sulfarsenide parageneses (this study) are conclusive. Basically, both data sets involve distinctly negative as well as positive values, and we are not able to see patterns relating obtained S isotope values to e.g. paragenetic stage, mineralogy or structural setting.\nThe S isotopic fractionation between arsenides\/sulfarsenides and S species like H2S is not easy to quantify because fractionation factors are not always known for pure phases and because metal substitution (Fe-Co-Ni) can take place (Liu et al., 2016). Generally, large isotopic differences are seen among analyzed samples, and the indicated relatively high hydrothermal temperatures (Dolansky, 2007) suggest that isotopic equilibrium is approached and that a fractionation between e.g. a sulfarsenide and H2S will be limited and less than a few per mil. Therefore, an exact knowledge of mineral-dependent fractionation is considered less important and will not affect conclusions to be drawn.\nMineral deposition in the Bou Azzer area involved rare barite along with a massive presence of sulphides, arsenides and sulfarsenides, and this argues for a total dominance of reduced sulphur in ore-forming fluids. This in turn is suggesting that the dependence of S isotope data on changes in pH and fO2 will not be very large. From this follows that an analyzed S isotope value for a sample will be similar to that of locally available, dissolved H2S and also approximatively equal to the value of the total sulphur in solution (Ohmoto, 1972). In other words, the obtained (and variable) \u03b434S values imply that the isotopic composition of locally available dissolved sulphur is highly heterogeneous.\nThe metals, in particular, Ni and Co are likely to have been derived from a magmatic source, e.g. the ophiolite suite of rocks, and magmatic sulphur has \u03b434S values that cluster around zero per mil. Tamdrost has the simplest distribution with \u03b434S data that cluster around zero and hence could reflect a component totally dominated by magmatic sulphur. On the other hand, magmatic sulphur alone cannot explain the isotopic patterns from other deposits in the ore district, as for instance the bulk of S isotope data from Filon 7\/5 and Aghbar deposits are around\u00a0+\u00a06 \u2030. Besides, the occasionally negative values found at Filon 7\/5 and Aghbar, and the strongly negative values characterizing the A\u00eft-Ahmane deposit cannot be reconciled with a simple magmatic origin of sulphur. Some input of locally\/regionally available sedimentary sulphur into a magmatic-type fluid carrying nickel and cobalt seems inevitable. There are no data available that help delineate if TSR (thermochemical sulphate reduction) or BSR (bacterial sulphate reduction) processes, or a combination of both, were responsible for producing reduced sulphur of variable isotopic composition. The most negative values are probably best explained by BSR processes and there are e.g. scattered sedimentary country rocks, like pelitic schists and black shales, that are likely to contain organic material that could drive a bacterial reduction process.\nInterestingly, the analyzed rocks, including four ophiolite-related rocks and one Qz-diorite, are also isotopically variable with one \u03b434S value (-2.2 \u2030) for a gabbro that could reflect an undisturbed mantle signature, whereas the remaining values are clearly positive in the range six to nine per mil. This range of data is suggesting that the S isotopic compositions of ultramafic rocks and the rodingite must have been modified during serpentinization-related, hydrothermal alteration, or that mafic magmas assimilated sedimentary material. More data are needed to further understanding of the variable ore mineral signatures, but one important contribution was probably from isotopically variable mafic to ultramafic rocks. On the other hand, at least the clearly negative ore mineral values seem to demand a direct input of locally available sedimentary sulphur to a magmatic fluid at depositional sites.\n\n\n5.5\nCrustal assimilation of ophiolite-forming magmas\nThe previous discussion, based on S, Sr and Nd isotope data, point out mafic ophiolite-type of rocks as the source of metals and that ore-forming fluids carry a sedimentary component. One way to bring these observations together is to argue that ore-forming fluids interacted with sedimentary units, but another option is that mafic rocks actually assimilated sedimentary material already during magma generation. A way to shed more light on this issue is to use the lead isotope data set, and Fig. 11\n shows initial lead isotope compositions for the individual ophiolite-related and other rock magmas, back-calculated to a common emplacement age of 658\u00a0Ma. In the frame-work of the plumbotectonics model (Zartman and Doe, 1981), such compositions are apparently slightly variable with some samples defining a data cluster between a mantle component and an upper crustal component (M and UC, respectively in Fig. 11), whereas others are seemingly linearly aligned. The data cluster (OPH-m in Fig. 11) is interpreted to represent an originally fairly homogeneous juvenile, mantle-derived magma source that has assimilated variable amounts of crustal rocks. Tentatively, this data cluster represents the lead isotope compositions of all analyzed ophiolite-rocks at the time of their emplacement. Nonetheless, certain mafic samples apparently plot outside this cluster and either this discrepancy is due to post-crystallization processes whereby minor amounts of lead or uranium was added, or lost, to the rock system. Such a process would compromise the back-calculation procedure that is based on a closed-system behavior, and instead of creating a narrow data cluster in the used diagram type, certain data would fall along a 658\u00a0Ma isochron (indicated to the dotted trend line in Fig. 11). Alternatively, the generalized crustal component depicted in the plumbotectonics model is not appropriate to consider. Instead, a more complex crustal assimilation affecting a mafic magma chamber, involving pre-658\u00a0Ma rocks in the area, may be a more viable process. The latter option finds some support from the overall pattern in Fig. 11 where some country rocks, e.g. Trh-40 (rhyolite) and the pegmatite (T-pegm), have calculated isotopic compositions at 658\u00a0Ma which plot at the extreme ends of the linear trend line, and thereby may comprise tentative assimilants into a magma chamber. To conclude, the inferred crustal assimilation event can explain why e.g. published Nd isotope data of ophiolites and associated rocks (Ikenne et al., 2020) are not typical for a pure, juvenile mantle component and why isotopically heavy sulphur is characterizing most ophiolites (this study).\n\n\n5.6\nOre-forming model\nA range of investigations have been carried out on several Co-Ni ores of the Bou Azzer area. Such data together with new results from this study enable the construction of an updated model with emphasis on isotopic constraints on the timing and nature of ore-forming processes.\n\nTiming: Available geochronological and field data are offering various possible ages of mineralization. Generally, radiometric ages may, except for representing real ore-forming events, signify e.g. hydrothermal alteration, late veining and isotopic resetting. Ikenne et al. (2020) did not rule out the possibility of a primary Pan-African mineralization event followed by remobilization of metals during Hercynian events. Supporting a temporal relationship between Pan-African and mineralization events is the structural setting where the main orebodies are located along transcurrent sinistral faults belonging to the ultimate Pan-African phase, active between 615 and 580\u00a0Ma ago. However, no published radiometric dating of ore components supports a Pan-African connection, and crosscutting and offsetting relationships imply that orebodies postdate the serpentinization (Fanlo et al., 2015) and the structures of the major Pan-African tectonic phase (Leblanc and Billaud, 1982).\nBasically, the geochronological evidence suggests two age modes; an older mode between ca. 380 and 355\u00a0Ma is defined by U-Pb brannerite ages at Filon 7\/5 (Dolansky, 2007), which represent \u201cchemical dates\u201d obtained by using an electron microprobe. Similar ages, \u2264400\u00a0Ma, were obtained from Pb-Pb relationships defined by ore minerals from Aghbar and Tamdrost (this study), and from Ar-Ar dating of muscovite from a barren quartz vein at Tamdrost (Levresse, 2001). Also, Re-Os molybdenite ages from Filon 7 and Aghbar fall in the 400\u2013350\u00a0Ma interval (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009). However, it must be recalled that although this system usually yields robust age information the presented dates are model ages that rely on certain assumptions, and Oberth\u00fcr et al. (2009) and Ikenne et al. (2020) raised doubts about their relevance. A younger age mode at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0310\u00a0Ma is indicated by laser ablation, ICPMS U-Pb brannerite ages of Filon 7 samples (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009), and similar ages were obtained from ore carbonates sampled in three different areas of the district using the Sm-Nd method (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009). However, ages significantly younger than about 300\u00a0Ma, e.g. ca. 220\u00a0Ma Ar-Ar muscovite ages at Tamdrost (Levresse, 2001), 260\u00a0Ma, or lower, U-Pb ages of altered brannerite from Filon 7\/5 (Dolansky, 2007, Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009), might reflect later over-printing events that did not involve any new addition of metals.\nApparently, brannerite is a key mineral for putting age constraints on ore formation, but its high U content makes this phase susceptible for post-crystallization lead loss as also seen in partly discordant U-Pb data defining a lower intercept age at 65\u00a0Ma (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009). It is viable that post-crystallization processes could also explain why there is a bimodal brannerite U-Pb age distribution. One possibility is that analyzed brannerite clusters (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009) have suffered a complete lead loss during Hercynian peak-metamorphism, and that the obtained 310\u00a0Ma date is a reset age. If so, 385\u2013350\u00a0Ma brannerite ages (Dolansky, 2007) of unaltered brannerite inclusions in skutterudite are the best estimate of brannerite crystallization, and by inference ore formation. Also, similar\u00a0\u2264\u00a0400\u00a0Ma Pb-Pb dates of arsenides (this study), essentially controlled by coeval brannerite inclusions, may be significant if arsenide grains have acted as a shield preventing the Pb-Pb system of brannerite to become disturbed by later hydrothermal-tectonic events. Altogether, radiometric evidences do not allow any tight age constraint to be set on ore formation. Probably, the 400\u2013300\u00a0Ma period witnessed a series of tectonic and hydrothermal events, and given the variability in e.g. isotopic and fluid inclusion results it seems feasible that several episodes of ore mineral deposition occurred in this time interval.\n\nOre-forming scenario: Our working hypothesis is that the primary introduction of metals took place during Devonian-Carboniferous, district-scale events that reactivated old Pan-African tectonic structures as a result of N-S shortening (Gasquet et al., 2005). An episode of ore deposition may have involved repeated re-activation of old faults along with concurrent vein formation and initiation of hydrothermal fluid flow. Lead isotope data of ore minerals (this study) point out ophiolite-related rocks, e.g. serpentinites, and also quartz-diorites as major sources of metals. Both rock types have a strong spatial relationship to ore bodies and show isotopic signatures at the proposed average (350\u00a0Ma) time of ore formation that match the inferred lead isotope composition of the bulk ore. Serpentinites are also often showing dissolution textures as a result of fluid interaction (Hajjar et al., 2021) which argue for a direct involvement in ore formation. Probably, competence contrasts between serpentinites and surrounding wall rocks have governed the development of weakness zones (e.g. fault zones; Tourneur et al., 2021) that have acted as conduits for mineralizing fluids.\nIt is likely that tectonic activity triggered the percolation of fluids along shears and faults across a large area. Such fluids probably interacted with mafic magmatic rocks, thereby leaching nickel and cobalt, but substantial amounts of other elements were also picked from country rocks. Following earlier suggestions (En-Naciri, 1995, En-Naciri et al., 1997, Dolansky, 2007), ore fluids comprised reduced brines that became more oxidized at later stages. This view is basically consistent with hydrogen and oxygen isotope evidence (Dolansky, 2007, Maacha et al., 2015) which were interpreted to support the presence of hot, saline fluids of magmatic origin, and that cooler, dilute meteoric fluids subsequently entered mineralization sites. The complex picture arising from fluid inclusion studies is also in agreement with fluid mixing and associated changes in e.g. temperature and salinity. Fluids of meteoric origin that progressively invaded ore sites, and perhaps also triggered mineral precipitation, may have released reduced sulphur from e.g. pelitic schists that locally cap the ophiolite sequence. Carbonate rocks are reactive and locally abundant and the Sr isotope composition of an analyzed single sample appears to have been modified by percolating fluids suggesting that e.g. strontium and calcium were released from carbonates and picked up by percolating hydrothermal fluids.\nObviously, fluids that have experienced this geologic history could have passed, and interacted with, a range of rocks having different isotopic signatures before reaching a final site of ore deposition. Partly strongly negative \u0190Nd values of analyzed carbonates (Oberth\u00fcr et al., 2009; this study), indicate a systematic variation with geographical location suggesting that at certain sites ore-forming fluids must have interacted to a significant degree with an old, enriched source, as also indicated e.g. by an early Proterozoic lead isotope signature for a l\u00f6llingite (#1643\/10) from Tamdrost. When summarizing field and other data, a magmatic (ophiolitic) source of e.g. sulphur, lead and strontium probably was important at all sites, but ore elements were released also from various country rocks and this created heterogeneous ore isotope characteristics. Not least the suggested assimilation\/alteration history for the ophiolitic-type rocks, that led to isotopic heterogeneities, played a role in creating partly erratic analytical results.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n- Overall, new data from the present study, and other evidence, support Devonian-Carboniferous mineralization events operating on a large regional scale as a response to N-S shortening. Probably, the features of different deposits are the ultimate result of multi-episodic ore-forming events in connection with repeated re-activation of old faults along with concurrent vein formation and initiation of hydrothermal fluid flow.\n- Although derived from the mantle, the ophiolite-related rocks do not exhibit typical mantle isotopic signatures. This might be explained by assimilation processes where crustal material may have been incorporated during crystallization of discrete magmas.\n- It is suggested that ophiolites of a mantle origin rocks have been the main supplier of ore elements. Yet, Pb, Sr, Nd and S isotope data generate a quite consistent picture where ore fluids have scavenged elements from a number of isotopically different crustal sources including both inferred basement lithologies and sedimentary rocks.\n- The presence of minute, coeval brannerite inclusions in arsenides and sulfarsenides excerpts a strong control on their lead and neodymium isotope behavior.\n- Pb isotope results suggest that certain of the studied felsic rocks represent early Proterozoic lithologies. Based on old Nd model ages, it is possible that also additional rocks may be much older than hitherto believed; an alternative interpretation is that these rocks have incorporated significant amounts of old basement components. New radiometric dating is required in order to shed further light on this issue.\n\n","44":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe characterization of orogenic gold deposits and the identification of suitable vectoring tools to locate the most favorable locations for ore deposition, are challenging tasks for gold exploration projects. Their success depends on the significant understanding of the geodynamic and metallogenic settings that control the genesis of such deposits, as well as, clearly identifying the mineralization style. Such knowledge is highly reliable on the current accepted orogenic gold models but comparing such models to local field exploration data is extremely challenging and may sometimes lead to demotivating results.\nThe diverse ore-emplacement mechanisms described for this kind of deposit depends on factors such as time (geological age) and space (geological settings). Although, the collection of multidisciplinary data from orogenic gold deposits can ultimately allow the definition of successful exploration vectors.\nWe focus our research on developing an approach that can beneficiate gold exploration in SW Iberia, targeting the mechanisms behind gold transport and deposition, and the structural controls in the Escoural gold district.\nThe above-mentioned time and space dilemma generate prolific discussions and a fair amount of uncertainty regarding the conditions in which orogenic gold deposits form (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Wyman et al., 2016; and Gaboury, 2019). However, many physical and chemical conditions are shared by different orogenic gold deposits, such as the involvement of metamorphic fluids in gold transport, in relatively reduced conditions, and driven by regionally expressive crustal anisotropies. It is generally accepted that gold is transported in AuHS- and Au(HS)-\n2 complexes, and therefore sulfur activity in the system plays a major role in controlling the transport-deposition mechanisms (Lindgren, 1907, 1933; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Phillips and Powell, 2010; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015).\nThe separation of gold from the sulfur compounds can be promoted by the oxidation of the transporting fluid (Hodkiewicz et al., 2009; LaFlamme et al., 2018a, 2018b). Hence, comprehending the geochemical conditions that could trigger oxidation is of uttermost importance for understanding the mechanisms that lead to gold accumulation. Several authors have identified a fair amount of processes that contribute to the fluid oxidation, such as i) fluid mixing from different sources (Uemoto et al., 2002; Bateman and Hagemann, 2004; Melfos et al., 2019); ii) cyclic fracturing causing pressure fluctuations in the fluid (Sibson et al., 1975; Hodkiewicz et al., 2009; Peterson and Mavrogenes, 2014; Voisey et al. 2020); iii) fluid-rock interactions, such as, carbonation and sulfidation (Phillips, 1986; Phillips and Hughes, 1996; Palin and Xu 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Petrella et al., 2020) or even iv) devolatilization by metamorphic fluids as discussed by Phillips and Powell (2010).\nSeveral gold deposits with genetic links to large shear zones are found throughout the Iberian Massif. Such deposits developed in the late stages of collisional event of the Variscan orogeny, in both orogenic and intrusion-related systems (e.g. Cepedal et al., 2013, 2018; D\u2019Angelico et al., 2016; de Oliveira et al., 2007; Fuertes-Fuentes et al., 2016; MacKenzie et al., 2019; Martinez-Abad et al., 2015; Neiva et al., 2019; Noronha et al., 2000; Ribeiro et al., 1993; Rodr\u00edguez-Terente et al., 2018; Vallance et al., 2003; Mortensen et al., 2014; Leal et al., 2022). In the north of Portugal, these deposits are found hosted in metasedimentary sequences (e.g. Tresminas or Valongo areas) and granitic units (e.g. the Penedono, Grovelas, or Castromil deposits), spatially associated with Variscan shear ductile\u2013brittle structures. In such deposits the nature of the mineralizing hydrothermal solutions was identified as related with metamorphic fluids, displaying variable contribution of meteoric water to the system but without a recognizable input of magmatic fluids. Additionally, host rocks were identified as being the main source of metals and ligands to the mineralizing system, and the pronounced tectonism and associated structures, mostly shear zones and faults, served as pathways for fluid circulation (e.g. Noronha et al., 2000; Vallance et al., 2003; D\u2019Angelico et al., 2016). Despite the extended time\u2013space distribution, diverse metal sources, and the variety of ore-forming fluids, these deposits exhibit similarities, such as i) evidence of successive shearing with recurrent reactivation, ii) geodynamic settings that contributed to complex polyphasic fluid percolation; and iii) a typical gold-arsenopyrite ore-stage assemblage (e.g. Noronha et al., 2000; Fuertes-Fuentes et al., 2016).\nGold deposits located on northern Iberia have been recently targeted for numerous multidisciplinary studies (Cepedal et al., 2013, 2018; D\u2019Angelico et al., 2016; Fuertes-Fuentes et al., 2016; MacKenzie et al., 2019; Martinez-Abad et al., 2015; Neiva et al., 2019; Noronha et al., 2000; Rodr\u00edguez-Terente et al., 2018; Vallance et al., 2003; Mortensen et al., 2014; Leal et al., 2022). On the contrary, at the SW of the Iberian Massif, particularly in Ossa-Morena Zone (OMZ), the characterization of gold deposits is not so well constrained. In this region, gold mineralization appears to be restricted to large Variscan shear zones with strike-slip kinematics. These geological settings are found at the S\u00e3o Martinho and Mosteiros deposits (De Oliveira et al., 2007) and at the numerous deposits and occurrences of the Escoural gold district, which are mainly hosted in Neoproterozoic to Lower Cambrian metasedimentary and metavolcanic units.\nBecause of this, identify and understand the mechanisms that promoted the gold precipitation is the main objective of this research, aiming to contribute to the comprehension of the Escoural gold district.\nHerein a comprehensive study of the Monfurado gold prospect, part of the puzzling Escoural gold district, is provided. A wide range of techniques, including, mineralogical, geochemical, sulfur isotope, and fluid inclusion studies were employed, thus allowing to infer the sources of metals, fluid pathways, and fluid-rock interactions capable of triggering the mechanisms responsible for the anomalous gold concentrations in the area.\n\n\n2\nGeological settings\n\n2.1\nGeodynamic context of Iberia\nThe Iberian Massif represents the westernmost section of the European Variscides, and comprises a set of geological units formed during Palaeozoic that can be described in three different stages: i) the Cambrian-Early Ordovician rift stage, responsible for the separation of the Avalonia terrane at the northern Gondwana margin, forming the Rheic Ocean; ii) the Ordovician \u2013 Devonian passive margin stage, and iii) the middle-Devonian to Carboniferous subduction and posterior Gondwana-Laurussia oblique collision resulting in the closure of the Rheic Ocean and edification of Pangea (e.g. Franke, 2000; 2014 Matte, 2001; Nance et al., 2010; 2012; Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira et al., 2017; Franke et al., 2017; Kroner et al., 2020).\nThe Cambrian-Early Ordovician rift stage at the northern Gondwana margin promoted the formation of several sedimentary basins in horst-graben structures, together with bimodal volcanic activity, which is well expressed throughout Iberia. The earlier expressions of rift-related volcanism are mainly restricted to the near-axis region in the southern domains, and late-stage assemblages are found widespread throughout the Iberian Massif (Chichorro et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Garcia et al., 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2019, and references therein; Castro et al., 2020). The rift stage ended with the complete detachment of Avalonia, which drifted away from northern Gondwana, and gave birth to the Rheic Ocean during the Early Ordovician ages (ca 480\u00a0Ma; Pedro et al., 2010; Ribeiro et al., 2010). The Early Ordovician rift-drift transition set Iberia into a wide passive margin stage that persisted until Lower Devonian (e.g. Dias et al., 2016; Guti\u00e9rrez-Marco et al., 2019).\nThe subsequent compressional stage begins with an accretion and subduction period followed by the transcurrent collisional episode that presumably occurred before Visean times (Dallmeyer et al., 1993; Jesus et al., 2007; Jesus et al., 2016; Pin et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2012). This period is characterized by i) extreme tectonism near the Avalonia-Gondwana suture zone; ii) orogenic metamorphism with considerable variations of the P-T regime; iii) the emplacement of parautocthonous and allochthonous terranes in the inner autochthon domains of the Iberian Massif, namely obduction of ophiolite fractions with the exhumation of high-pressure units, and iv) subduction and syn-collision magmatism (e.g. Quesada et al., 1994; Quesada et al., 2019; Pedro, 1996; 2004; Pedro et al., 2010; Fonseca et al., 1999; Leal, 2001; Dias et al., 2002; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2005; Valle Aguado et al., 2005; Moita et al., 2005a; Ribeiro et al., 2007; 2010; Jesus et al., 2007; Jesus et al., 2016; Rosas et al., 2008; Moita et al., 2009; Rubio Pascual et al., 2013; Dias et al., 2016; Azor et al., 2019).\nThree main stages of deformation characterize the Variscan orogen, starting with D1 which correspond to subduction-related crustal thickening as a result of thrust sheet stockpiling and recumbent or overturned folds that affect all units before Devonian ages; D2 characterized by decompression and\/or orogenic collapse and extension, and D3 correspondent to a post-collisional thickening stage, implying vertical folds, ductile shears and strike-slip faults (Azor et al., 2019 and references therein).\n\n\n2.2\nOssa-Morena Zone\nThe variety of tectonic-metamorphic and magmatic events that affected the Iberian Massif during the Variscan Cycle is expressed by a well-defined tectono-stratigraphic zonation (Lotze, 1945; Julivert et al., 1972; Ribeiro et al., 1995; 2007; Murphy et al., 2016; Simancas, 2019). In SW Iberia, the Rheic suture zone divides two important tectonic-stratigraphic units: the Ossa-Morena Zone, which represents the northernmost autochthonous terrane of Gondwana, and the South Portuguese Zone (SPZ), interpreted to embody a remnant of Avalonia separated in Cambrian - Early Ordovician times and posteriorly accreted during the collisional stages of the Variscan orogeny.\nThe OMZ comprises a thick sequence of variably metamorphosed rocks with ages ranging from Neoproterozoic to Carboniferous, packed with debris presumably resulting from the dismantlement of a pre-existing Cadomian arc (Apalategui et al., 1990; Oliveira et al., 1991; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2013). The base sequence is characterized by the Lower Cambrian basal conglomerate and a calcite-dolomite carbonate formation, discordantly settled on top of the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary basement (locally named S\u00e9rie Negra), followed by a succession of siliciclastic strata culminated by syn-orogenic flysch, deposited from Middle-Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous (Oliveira et al., 1991; Pi\u00e7arra, 2000; Robardet and Guti\u00e9rrez-Marco, 2004; Borrego, 2009; Guti\u00e9rrez-Marco et al., 2019). The Cambrian-Early Ordovician rift events are accompanied by the emplacement of a series of acid-intermediate and basic volcanic rocks intercalated in the carbonate and detrital units of Lower-Middle Cambrian age (Chichorro et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Garcia et al., 2010; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2019).\nThe subduction and collisional episodes promoted the thrusting of ophiolitic and bordering units of the Iberian Terrane to the inner domains of the OMZ, as well as the exhumation of high-pressure rocks (e.g. the Moura Phyllonitic Complex; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2005; Moita et al., 2005a; Rosas et al., 2008; Pedro et al, 2010; Ribeiro et al., 2010), and the emplacement of the Pulo do Lobo Terrane, an accretionary wedge overlaying the SPZ (e.g. Quesada et al., 1994). Additionally, several bimodal igneous suites were installed in the OMZ during different stages of the collisional event (Pereira et al., 2003; Pereira et al., 2007; Pereira et al., 2008; Jesus et al., 2007; Jesus et al., 2016; Moita et al., 2005b; Moita et al., 2009; Dias da Silva et al. 2018; Ribeiro et al. 2019). The Variscan tectonic-metamorphic and magmatic events kept high-thermal regional regimes in Iberia and promoted the circulation of magmatic, metamorphic, and hydrothermal fluids responsible for the generation of some of the ore deposits widespread throughout OMZ.\n\n\n2.3\nThe Montemor-o-Novo - Ficalho metallogenic belt\nThe Montemor-o-Novo \u2013 Ficalho metallogenic belt (Mateus et al., 2013; Tornos et al., 2004) is part of the Montemor-Ficalho lithostratigraphic Sector (Oliveira et al., 1991) delimited at North by the Estremoz-Barrancos Sector and at South by the Beja Igneous Complex. This belt displays an extremely complex evolution, evidenced by its structural, geological, and metallogenic features. The commodities are diverse, including Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Au, and are represented by several ore assemblages hosted in diverse geological settings. Hence, several models are invoked to explain their occurrence, such as the SEDEX-VMS iron ores (Montemor-o-Novo iron deposits; Salgueiro, 2011); Zn-Pb deposits (Pregui\u00e7a-Vila Ruiva and Enfermarias deposits; Barroso et al., 2003; Martins et al., 2003), or Skarn deposits (Orada, Azenhas, and Alvito Fe deposits; Carvalho, 1971, Oliveira, 1986; Matos et al., 1998, Caldeira et al., 2007; Salgueiro et al., 2010a, Salgueiro et al., 2010b; Mateus et al., 2005; Mateus et al., 2013; Maia et al., 2022).\nThroughout the 18th and early 19th century this area was an important mining district with operations focusing on eight iron ore bodies (Andrade et al., 1949). The deposits are mainly composed of massive magnetite-pyrite (\u00b1chalcopyrite) and are hosted in Cambrian-Lower Ordovician units, for which recent studies suggest a Cambrian SEDEX-VMS continuum model (Salgueiro, 2011).\nAside from the iron ores found in the Montemor-o-Novo area, several gold deposits have been targeted during the last decades, forming what is here described as the Escoural gold district. This district was the focus of several gold-exploration projects and scientific research, providing first descriptions of the gold endowment in the Escoural gold district deposits (Ribeiro et al., 1993). These earlier studies presented the first proposal that classified the deposits as Orogenic gold (Inverno, 2001). More recently, Lopes (2015) and Lopes et al. (2015) provided petrographic and isotopic (Sr-Nd) studies of host lithologies.\nThe calculated resources for the Escoural gold district reached 4.45 million tons of ore with a mean gold grade of 2.81\u00a0g\/ton, translating into 440 000\u00a0oz\/12.5 tons of Au (Faria et al., 1997; Mateus et al., 2013; Lopes, 2015 and references therein), in which 45% are inferred mineral resources, 46% indicated and 9% measured. Previous authors tried to frame the ore deposition conditions, emphasizing on the sedimentary, structural, and geochemistry settings, whereas a multi-technique approach to the ores, as the one herein proposed, has never been endeavored.\n\n\n2.4\nEscoural gold district\nThe Escoural gold district is part of the \u00c9vora Massif, which is subdivided into three units: i) the high-grade metamorphic terrains, ii) the Montemor-o-Novo Shear Zone and iii) the \u00c9vora mid-grade metamorphic terrains (Pereira et al., 2003; Pereira et al., 2006; Chichorro, 2006; Moita et al., 2009).\nThis gold district is structurally controlled by the wide (2\u201310\u00a0km) ductile NW-SE upper Carboniferous Montemor-o-Novo Shear Zone (MNSZ), which extends for over 30\u00a0km and hosts 12 known deposits (Fig. 1\n\na). Greenschist to amphibolitic facies metamorphism is ubiquitous in the area (Fig. 1\nb), and deformation is outlined by intense mylonitization that allowed to constrain the ages through which MNSZ was active (356 \u2013 322\u00a0Ma; Pereira et al., 2015 and references therein). Most of the gold prospects (2\u201312 in Fig. 1\na) occur near the contact between the MNSZ and the high-grade metamorphic terrains, structurally controlled by the Boa F\u00e9 fault zone (Fig. 1\na), with exception of the Monfurado gold prospect which is located in the vicinity of the Santiago do Escoural fault. The units affected by the MNSZ can be defined as follow:\n\n1.\nEscoural Fm. (Neoproterozoic): A metasedimentary formation, locally designated as S\u00e9rie Negra, mainly composed of biotitic schists and quartz-feldspar paragneiss, resulting from the dismantlement of a Cadomian-Avalonian magmatic arc with ages ranging from 560 to 550\u00a0Ma (Chichorro, 2006).\n\n\n2.\nMonfurado Fm. (Lower Cambrian): This formation is individualized in two units (Chichorro, 2006), adopted subsequently by other authors (e.g. Salgueiro, 2011). The Lower unit is characterized by acid volcanism that is emplaced in the calcite-dolomite carbonate formations during the rift-related volcanic events (522.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma; Chichorro et al., 2008), with metamorphism and deformation superimposed during the Variscan orogeny. The acid metavolcanics are locally referred to as Escoural Leptinites and display affinities to rhyodacites and rhyolites (S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al., 2003; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2019, Chichorro, 2006). The Upper unit corresponds to the transition to an intermediate\/basic volcanism, composed of amphibolites and amphibolic schists.\n\n\n3.\nCarvalhal Fm. (Middle\u2013Upper Cambrian): Mainly composed of basic metavolcanic rocks affected by greenschist to amphibole facies metamorphism and strongly deformed by the MNSZ activity. The Carvalhal Fm. is divided into two units, a Lower unit in which amphibolites (E-MORB) predominate, with intercalations of calcsilicate rocks (Carvalhosa, 1983; Carvalhosa and Zbyszewski, 1994) and an Upper unit composed of phyllites and metabasites with N-MORB signatures.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1\nThe Monfurado gold prospect\nThe Monfurado prospect is located at the NW of the Escoural gold district (Fig. 1\na) and was one of the twelve targeted areas for mineral exploration. The Monfurado prospect is found near the ancient Monges iron mine (Fig. 1\nc; Andrade et al., 1949), north of the Santiago do Escoural village and mainly hosted by two geological units: the Escoural Fm. and Monfurado Fm (Lower and Upper units), described above (Fig. 1).\nA drilling campaign (11 drill holes) was performed in 2012 by the COLT Resources exploration company to assess the Monfurado gold prospect potential. Outcrops are scarce, and the area is covered by a thin regolith. Therefore, the log interpretation provided by the company and later reinterpreted for this work, was essential to identify the main geological and structural controls over gold mineralization.\nDrill core logs show a monocline structure generally dipping towards NE. The Escoural Fm. is found at the top of the logs (Fig. 2\n\n;\nFig. 3\n), and it is differentiated by paragneisses and thin amphibolic schist intercalations. The contact between the Escoural Fm. and the Monfurado Fm. units is marked by tectonism that is interpreted as an overthrust (Ara\u00fajo, 1995). The Upper unit of the Monfurado Fm. is composed by amphibolic schists (basic metavolcanic unit; Fig. 1\nb, c;\nFig. 2) usually interbedded with pristine marbles. This unit transits to calcite-dolomite carbonated lithotypes at depth, ranging from pure marbles to calcsilicate metasomatized rocks. The transition to the acid metavolcanic rocks is marked by an abrupt contact and is evidenced by the presence of orthogneisses and sparse metacherts. The acid metavolcanic rocks are intensely fractured with several generations of veins, although two main types are consistent throughout the studied drill core samples and can be divided in i) thin quartz\u00a0+\u00a0tourmaline veins (<1\u20132\u00a0cm) perpendicular to bedding with sections of high density (4 veins\/meter), and ii) sparse thicker quartz-feldspar-chlorite veins (up to 5\u00a0cm) parallel to bedding cross-cutting the latter veins.\nIn some of the deeper sections of the cores, another transition to the Monfurado Fm. is observed hosting the richer ore sections (c.f. Fig. 2), mainly composed of massive sulfide layers with pyrrhotite and disseminated arsenopyrite. The Monfurado Fm. is identified as an important fluid pathway due to its intense mineralization, represented by massive layers of sulfides mainly composed of pyrrhotite, pyrite and arsenopyrite in which the higher gold grades are found. The massive sulfide layers are hosted in a carbonate iron-rich unit, in sections immediately below the acid metavolcanic rocks (Fig. 2).\nMassive magnetite sections are observed throughout the drill cores, and pyrite is ubiquitous in all lithologies, mostly found in a disseminated form but locally occurring as massive layers.\nThe geochemical analysis of continuous log sections of 1\u00a0m length, provided by COLT Resources company shows that the distribution of gold grades is controlled by i) the presence of massive sulfide layers with disseminated arsenopyrite hosted in calcsilicate units, ii) quartz-chlorite-pyrite veins that crosscut the acid metavolcanic rocks. Interesting gold grades along the drill cores are shown in Fig. 2, and the mineralized envelope is defined in Fig. 3.\n\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\n\n3.1\nSampling\nA total of 133 samples were collected at different depths from six of the eleven drill cores (M4; M5; M6; M7; M8; M12; Fig. 1\nc; Fig. 2) and are representative of the host rock lithologies and main mineralized sections. Sampling also focused on altered host rocks to identify the extent of alteration related with the mineralizing event, as well as with the regional metamorphism. The sampling resulted in the preparation of 143 polished thin sections and 62 polished cross-sections for petrographic and mineralogical studies, 8 milled samples for whole-rock geochemistry, 15 double polished thick sections for the fluid inclusion study, and 11 sulfide concentrates for sulfur isotope geochemistry.\n\n\n3.2\nOptical and scanning electron microscopy\nPolished cross-sections and polished thin sections were observed under an optical microscope to identify the main mineral phases and establish the ore paragenesis. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis and image acquisition were performed using a VP-SEM-EDS Hitachi S3700N with a Bruker Xflash 5010SDD X-ray spectrometer at the HERCULES Laboratory of the University of \u00c9vora -Portugal-, and an MEB JEOL-6100 SEM-EDS at the Technical and Scientific Services of the University of Oviedo - Spain. All the mineralogical abbreviations adopted through this manuscript follow the proposals from Whitney and Evans (2010).\n\n\n3.3\nElectron probe microanalysis (EPMA)\nIn-situ arsenopyrite, pyrite, gold, chlorite, tourmaline, and feldspar analysis were performed using a CAMECA SX100 electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) at the Technical and Scientific Services of the University of Oviedo (Spain). The analytical conditions were selected as follows: i) for arsenopyrite and pyrite a\u00a0\u223c\u00a05\u00a0\u00b5m beam diameter was used, with an acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV and a 20\u00a0nA current for As, S, and Fe quantification, and a 20\u00a0kV acceleration voltage and 100nA current was used for Au quantification; ii) for gold particle analysis a\u00a0\u223c\u00a05\u00a0\u00b5m beam was used to analyze the larger Au grains with an acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV and a current of 20\u00a0nA, and iii) for silicates and acceleration voltage of 15\u00a0kV and a 15\u00a0nA current was used.\nThe standards used for S, As, Fe were arsenopyrite, for Au, Cu, Se, Fe, Bi, Ag, and Hg the standards were pure gold, pure copper, pure selenium, pure iron, pure bismuth, silver telluride, and mercury sulfide respectively. All raw data including the limits of detection (LOD) for each element is disclosed in \nSupplementary Material\n\nB.\n\n\n3.4\nFluid inclusion studies\nFluid inclusion (FI) studies were performed at the Geoscience Department of the University of \u00c9vora using a LINKAM THMSG600 microthermometry stage coupled to a Nikon Eclipse 50Ipol microscope with a 100x long focus objective lens. Microthermomety cooling runs were performed using a 1\u00a0\u00b0C to 10\u00a0\u00b0C\/min rates to ensure a cooling that allows the observation of the different phase changes, such as the first CH4 melting temperatures (TmCH4), CO2 melting temperature (TmCO2), eutectic temperature (Te), and ice melting temperature (Tmice). The heating runs were performed using a 5\u00a0\u00b0C\/min to 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/min step heating, assuring the accuracy of measurements of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C and allowing to register CO2 homogenization temperatures (ThCO2) and final homogenization temperatures (Th).\nFluid inclusion salinities were calculated using the Tmice (Bodnar and Vityk, 1994) and Tmchl when CO2 was present, and when correct observation of this phase transition was possible. To constrain the P-T-V-x conditions of the fluids in the H2O-NaCl system, the AqSo_NaCl Software (Bakker, 2018) was used, and for the H2O-CH4 system, the BULK package was used (Bakker, 2003).\n\n\n3.5\nSulfur isotope geochemistry\nSamples for sulfur isotope analysis were separated under the microscope to ensure the representativeness of the mineralization assemblages.\nThe selected samples were crushed for the selection of monomineralic grains of arsenopyrite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite. Arsenopyrite and pyrite were hand-picked under a binocular stereomicroscope, whereas pyrrhotite was separated using a hand-magnet and then hand-picked. Sulfur isotope analysis was performed by obtaining SO2 for the determination of the 34S\/32S isotopic ratio by isotope ratio mass spectrometry at the NUCLEUS Laboratory, University of Salamanca - Spain.\n\n\n3.6\nWhole-rock geochemistry\nMajor element bulk analysis was performed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) whereas trace and rare earth element analysis were quantified by ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma \u2013 Mass Spectroscopy) through a fusing bead and acid digestion method. Both analyses were performed at ALS Seville Laboratories using the ME-XRF26 and ME-MS81 analytical packages.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nHost rock petrography and geochemistry\n\n4.1.1\nEscoural formation\nAt the study area, the Escoural Fm. is composed of quartz-feldspar paragneiss with feldspar porphyroblasts visible in hand samples. The matrix displays strong deformation, and mineral strain is materialized by the presence of fine plates of biotite surrounding the porphyroblasts of feldspar (Fig. 4\n\na). These crystals have pale polysynthetic twinning and are associated with recrystallized fine-grained quartz on strain shadows. The quartz from the paragneiss matrix displays the development of ribbon textures, which outline the stretching lineation. Some samples exhibit the growth of amphibole (mainly actinolite), agreeing with the greenschist-amphibolitic metamorphic conditions described for the region.\nGeochemistry of a paragneiss from this unit (Sample 1;\nTable 1\n) revealed relatively high SiO2 content, low Al2O3 values (70.5\u00a0wt% and 12.8\u00a0wt%, respectively), and Na2O\/K2O of 3.41, as expected for coarse metasedimentary rocks. The REE diagram normalized to Chondrite (Palme and \u00d3Neill, 2014; Fig. 5\n) show high fractionation of LREE over MREE (La\/SmCN\u00a0=\u00a03.98), slightly flat HREE (Sm\/YbCN\u00a0=\u00a01.13), and a marked positive Eu anomaly (McLennan 1989) of Eu\/Eu* = 1.25. Such values are slightly different than other major element geochemical data of metagraywackes and paragneisses from Serie Negra reported in literature (SiO2\u00a0=\u00a055 \u2013 66\u00a0wt%, Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a015 \u2013 19\u00a0wt%; Pereira et al., 2006; Lopes, 2015; D\u00edez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017). Likewise, the steep LREE\/MREE patterns are observed in bibliographic data, but contrast with the considerable negative Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu* = 0.43 \u2013 0.87).\n\n\n4.1.2\nMonfurado formation (Lower unit)\nThe acid metavolcanic rocks are composed of a quartz-feldspar matrix, with a white to greyish color in hand sample, and are often crosscut by late-quartz veins. Local variations of this lithology display biotite development, observable in hand samples.\nThin section examination allows to describe this lithotype as medium-grained, mainly composed of euhedral quartz crystals (Qz I) with sparse large porphyroblasts of feldspar (Fig. 4\nc), mostly plagioclase which exhibit polysynthetic twinning. Hydrothermal alteration is pervasive and is materialized by intense sericite alteration of plagioclase (Fig. 4\nc). Quartz exhibits deformation features, such as undulatory extinction and ribbon textures in the most deformed sections, whereas biotite is found in fine plates, sub-parallel to the main foliation plane.\nThe acid metavolcanic rocks are strongly affected by brittle deformation that promoted the development of centimetric quartz veining (Qz IIa\/IIb; Fig. 4\nc, d). The Qz IIa veins correspond to sub-vertical structures that generally crosscut bedding and are ubiquitously accompanied by tourmaline (Fig. 4\nd). These veins are perpendicularly crosscut by Qz IIb veins, which are mainly composed of quartz, feldspar and pyrite (Fig. 4\nc).\nTourmaline is cogenetic with quartz IIa, and displays characteristic triangular basal sections (Fig. 4\nd, e), with green to brownish optical zoning, and subhedral to euhedral shapes. Epidote aggregates are seldomly observed throughout the matrix, along with Qz I.\nSamples of the acid metavolcanic rocks (Sample 2, 3, 4, and 5;\nTable 1) revealed chemical compositions consistent with a rhyolite to rhyodacite calc-alkaline affinity (Fig. 5\nb) and volcanic arc-like signature (Nb\/Y\u00a0=\u00a00.21\u20130.44; Fig. 5\na). CN REE generally displays flat patterns with subtle enrichments in LREE over MREE and HREE (La\/SmCN\u00a0=\u00a01.1 \u2013 3.4; Sm\/YbCN\u00a0=\u00a01.1 \u2013 1.9; Fig. 5), well pronounced negative Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu*= 0.25 \u2013 0.49) and slightly demarked Ce anomaly (Ce\/Ce*= 0.79 \u2013 1.07), according to the McLennan (1989) equation. The herein presented geochemical data for the acid metavolcanic rocks is consistent with previously published data regarding other MNSZ rift-related volcanic events (Pedro, 1996; Leal, 2001; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al., 2003; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2019; Chichorro, 2006)\n\n\n4.1.3\nMonfurado formation (Upper unit)\nThe transition from acid to basic metavolcanic rocks is identified by other authors (Chichorro, 2006; Salgueiro, 2011), and is distinguishably marked by the presence of amphibolic units, some with schistosity. These rocks are composed of amphibole, namely hornblende and medium-grained feldspar porphyroblasts with an oval shape and strongly sericitized cores (Fig. 4\nb). Geochemistry of intermediate\/basic metavolcanic samples from these sections (Samples 8 and 9;\nTable 1) showed SiO2 values between 60.8\u00a0wt% and 49.1\u00a0wt%., respectively. Both samples have relatively high alumina and alkali content (Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a016.75\u00a0wt% and 14.3\u00a0wt%; Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O\u00a0=\u00a07.3\u00a0wt% and 4.3\u00a0wt%), although, in sample 8, trace element chemistry is characterized by low Nb\/Y (0.41) and Zr\/Ti (0.04), but high LILE components (Rb\u00a0=\u00a0122\u00a0ppm; Ba\u00a0=\u00a0823\u00a0ppm; Sr\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0ppm), which is in accordance with volcanic-arc tectonic setting of emplacement. Sample 9 (Table 1), besides displaying lower SiO2 values, has very high CaO content (17.4\u00a0wt%); also, trace element ratios (Ti\/V\u00a0=\u00a027.5, Zr\/Y\u00a0=\u00a06.0) display affinities with basalts characteristic of E-MORB and within-plate environments, resembling the possible tectonic setting of the overlying Carvalhal Fm. (Pearce and Norry, 1979; Shervais, 1982; Chichorro et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2019).\nMarbles (Fig. 4\nf) are ubiquitous to the upper unit of the Monfurado formation, usually displaying a calcite-dolomite matrix as revealed by the high CaO (29.3\u00a0wt%) and MgO (18.3\u00a0wt%) contents (Sample 6).\nHydrothermal alteration of marbles is revealed by the development of calcsilicate assemblages dominated by actinolite-tremolite, which is sometimes accompanied by pyrite (Fig. 4\ng). One selected calcsilicate sample (Sample 7) revealed higher SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO values (6.88\u00a0wt%, 1.51\u00a0wt%, and 36.8\u00a0wt%), with lower Fe2O3 and MgO contents (3.35\u00a0wt% and 10.95\u00a0wt%) when compared to the pristine marble sample.\n\n\n\n4.2\nMineralized domains\nDifferent types of mineralization can only be identified through detailed petrographic characterization of the ores. Such work is essential in understanding the succession of events related to ore deposition, providing the sequence of crystallization and its relationship with the complex geological history of the region.\n\n4.2.1\nPre-Gold ore stage\n\n4.2.1.1\nOxides\nThe Monfurado gold prospect is spatially associated with iron ore bodies that belong to the Monges mine and are mainly hosted in marbles and calcsilicate rocks (Fig. 2). The iron ores possibly formed through submarine hydrothermal activity during the Cambro-Ordovician intracratonic rifting settings (Salgueiro, 2011), which are prone to the formation of SEDEX-VMS deposits.\nThe iron-rich domains intersected by the drill cores are fundamentally composed of metric massive to disseminated magnetite sections hosted in a calcite-dolomite matrix, with minor pyrite and sparse chalcopyrite. Needle-like amphibole crystals, identified as actinolite-tremolite, accompany the iron oxides (Fig. 6\n\na) that display intense deformation as evidenced by the boudin-shaped magnetite crystals (Fig. 6\na). Barite is found in close relation with magnetite and is, possibly, contemporary of its deposition.\n\n\n4.2.1.2\nSulfides paragenesis\nTwo main pre-ore pyrite-rich sulfide domains were identified as (1) isolated pyrite crystals hosted in marbles from the Upper unit of the Monfurado Fm. (Fig. 6\nb), and usually accompanied by amphibole-chlorite assemblages; and (2) massive pyrite layers in a fine-grained and euhedral quartz matrix, in which pyrite is usually surrounded by chlorite-amphibole aggregates with minor epidote (Fig. 6\nc). The quartz matrix found in this section suggests a volcanogenic nature for these pyrite accumulations, possibly similar to the one associated with the iron ores (SEDEX-VMS; Salgueiro, 2011).\n\n\n\n4.2.2\nGold ore stage\n\n4.2.2.1\nGold-sulfides assemblages in massive sulfide layers\nA massive sulfide layer (MSL) is present in the majority of the studied drill cores, apparently marking a laterally continuous layer, with an approximate thickness of 3 to 15\u00a0m. During the exploration campaigns the attention was drawn to M5, M7, and M12 drill cores (Fig. 2), which revealed gold grades up to 18\u00a0g\/ton in the MSL intersected by these drill cores (Fig. 2).\nThe MSL is hosted in metasomatized marbles of the Monfurado Fm. (Fig. 3), having pyrrhotite as the dominant sulfide phase and usually accompanied by fine to medium-grained actinolite-tremolite crystals (Fig. 6\nd, e;\nFig. 7\n\nb). Pyrite, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite are also present in variable proportions.\nMagnetite is partially replaced by pyrrhotite, and sparse relicts of the iron oxide are found within pyrrhotite, outlining the presence of sulfidation processes, (Fig. 7\na and b). Pyrrhotite preserves ductile deformation at all scales, displaying durchbewegung textures (e.g. Marshall and Gilligan, 1989) in hand samples (Fig. 8\n\na, b) and, at a microscopic scale, corrugation lamellae\/deformation twinning and strong anisotropy (Fig. 7\ne). Pyrrhotite mostly surrounds arsenopyrite and pyrite crystals (Fig. 7\nc) although, to a lesser extent, it is found in less deformed sections (Fig. 7\nf) in pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite assemblages.\nIn these layers gold is mainly associated with arsenopyrite (Apy A in Fig. 8) and pyrite (Py A in Fig. 9\n), although not exclusively. Arsenopyrite A display syn-kinematic textures that are compatible with the high strain observed in the host rocks\nA small and localized arsenopyrite-rich layer (Apy B in Fig. 8\nc) was identified in a quartz-chlorite matrix in a 0.6\u00a0m thick section of the M7 drill core (Fig. 6\nf, g). The relation between Apy B and the host rock is difficult to discern, nevertheless, it was possible to identify that the matrix is characterized by fine-grained anhedral quartz crystals and arsenopyrite is ubiquitously surrounded by chlorite with berlin-blue birefringence colors (Fig. 6\nf). Small and rare gold grains hosted in Apy B (Fig. 6\ng) and disperse in the quartz matrix (Fig. 8\nn, o) were identified, with no clear spatial relation to the MSL. The microscopic analysis of Apy A and Apy B suggests that they are homogeneous mineral phases, with no optical zonation, however, the backscatter electron images revealed a faint compositional zonation, indicating a slight arsenic depletion towards the rims of Apy A (Fig. 8\ng, h, i).\nGold grains are mostly found in arsenopyrite usually occurring as fracture filling in Apy A (Fig. 8\nh to m), and to a lesser extent in Py A (Fig. 9\nc, d, g, h). Ductile deformation in Py A crystals (Fig. 7\nc; blue dashed lines) is outlined by the presence of acicular amphibole, whereas brittle deformation is marked by perpendicular fracturing associated with micro-scale cataclasis (Fig. 7\nc; red dashed lines), affecting both Apy A and Py A. This type of deformation texture is particularly well preserved in the M4, M5 and M7 drill cores.\nChalcopyrite is abundant in the MSL, mostly found as fracture filling of Apy A, Py A and pyrrhotite (Fig. 7\nc,\nFig. 10\n\nb). Other relatively late sulfide phases, such as inclusions of hedleyite and altaite, were identified mainly associated to pyrrhotite (Fig. 10\nd, e). Sphalerite is observed along some fractures of arsenopyrite (Fig. 10\nc, g), whereas galena is found in fractures along with pyrrhotite and\/or chalcopyrite.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nGold-sulfides assemblages in acid metavolcanic rocks\nGold is also found in pyrite fractures (Fig. 9\ni, j) hosted in late veins crosscutting the acid metavolcanics, which exclusively occur at top of the MSL (Qz IIb; Fig. 4\nc, d, e). Pyrite hosting this gold mineralization type is addressed as Py B. The macroscopic analysis of hand samples suggests that pyrite is accompanied by chlorite and Qz IIb deposition and is controlled by late fracturing of the host rock (Fig. 9\nb).\nPyrite crystals (Py B) are usually euhedral, large (size\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b5m) ; Fig. 9\nb, e), and accompanied by intense chloritization of the host rock. At a microscopic scale, native gold is found in chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz assemblages (Fig. 10\na), and filling thin fractures in Py B, as revealed by backscattered imagery (Fig. 9\ni, j). Hedleyite was also found in Py B microfractures (Fig. 9\nk,\nFig. 10\nf).\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nSequence of crystallization\nThe sequence of crystallization for the Monfurado gold prospect (Fig. 11\n) was identified by petrography and descriptions of the textural features of the ores. Two main stages of metal input were identified: i) the pre-ore stage with an oxide and sulfide paragenesis and ii) the ore stage, in which gold mineralization is found in MSL, as well as in quartz-chlorite-pyrite veins hosted in the acid metavolcanic rocks.\nConcerning the ore stage, two main types of gold mineralization were identified, as follows:\n\n\u2022\nType i) correspond to gold in the MSL, which is ubiquitously composed of massive pyrrhotite and contains disseminated arsenopyrite (Apy A) and pyrite (Py A). These sulfide layers are sub-parallel to the surrounding iron-rich carbonate host rocks of the Monfurado Fm.. Gold deposition occurs in the rims and as fracture filling of arsenopyrite (Fig. 8) and, to a lesser extent, pyrite (Fig. 9). A single and constrained gold occurrence was found, in which Au is hosted in a layer composed almost exclusively of arsenopyrite (Apy B).\n\n\n\u2022\nType ii) mineralization is characterized by vein-hosted gold mineralization crosscutting the metavolcanic acid rocks. Gold is sometimes accompanied by Bi-Te phases (Fig. 10) and occurs as fracture filling of pyrite (Py B) associated with silicification and chloritization.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nFluid inclusion studies\n\n4.4.1\nFluid inclusion petrography\nQuartz-hosted fluid inclusions are common throughout the studied samples, while inclusions hosted in tourmaline, barite and tremolite are rarer, smaller, and harder to study due to the color and cleavage of the host minerals. Quartz samples were prepared from veins crosscutting the acid metavolcanics and calcsilicate rocks of the Monfurado Fm., described as Qz IIb (Fig. 4\nc;\nFig. 12\n\na-d).\nBarite and tremolite samples were prepared from calcsilicate rocks of the Monfurado Fm., which is the result of regional metamorphism and metasomatic alteration of marbles. The crystals are disseminated in a tremolite dominated matrix. Tourmaline samples were prepared from quartz-tourmaline - Qz IIa veins (Fig. 4\nd, e) - which are cross-cut by Qz IIb veins in the acid-metavolcanic rocks (Fig. 12\nd).\nFour types of fluid inclusions were identified, and the adopted fluid inclusion terminology is according to Boiron et al. (1992). Lc-w inclusions correspond to triphasic F\u00cds (LH2O-NaCl\u00a0+\u00a0LCO2\u00a0+\u00a0VCO2; Fig. 12\ne) with carbonic and aqueous volumetry varying significantly, occurring in transgranular fluid inclusion planes (FIP) in Qz IIb from veins that exclusively crosscut calcsilicate rocks. Lw1 F\u00cds occur as clusters of biphasic inclusions (L\u00a0+\u00a0V), hosted in baryte, tremolite (Fig. 12\nf) and tourmaline (Fig. 12\ni). Lw2 inclusions are biphasic (L\u00a0+\u00a0V; Fig. 12\ng), mainly found in transgranular FIP in quartz-plagioclase-chlorite-pyrite veins (Qz IIb; Fig. 12\na-d). The volumetric proportion ratio between the liquid and vapor phase varies between 10 and 15 bubble vol. % for both Lw1 and Lw2 inclusions. The aqueous Lw1 and Lw2 fluid inclusions show a clear dominance over Lc-w and are found in samples from different depths.\nLastly, methane-rich fluid inclusions (Fig. 12\nh) hosted in quartz were identified in transgranular FIP (Fig. 12\nj) and were exclusively observed in samples from quartz veins (Qz IIb) crosscutting the acid metavolcanic-rocks from the Monfurado Fm. (Fig. 12\na-d). These inclusions have an oval shape, with liquid CH4 displaying a dark color and homogeneous aqueous H2O-phase proportion (5%), at room temperature.\n\n\n4.4.2\nMicrothermometry\nSummarized microthermometry results are shown in Table 2\n and Fig. 13\n, and the complete data is provided in \nSupplementary Material A\n. Lc-w fluid inclusions showed TmCO2 ranging between \u221258.6\u00a0\u00b0C and \u221256.8\u00a0\u00b0C which indicates a near CO2-pure phase, with minor concentrations of CH4 (\u22485% mol; Thiery et al., 1994; Maia et al., 2019). ThCO2 ranged from 0\u00a0\u00b0C to 24.6\u00a0\u00b0C and homogenization exclusively occurred into the liquid phase. Clathrate phases were identified in Lc-w inclusions, however, due to the small size and clustered occurrence of these F\u00cds, a correct measurement of Tmchl was not possible, thus it was not possible to perform salinity and pressure estimations.\nIce melting temperatures measured in Lw1 inclusions hosted in baryte range from \u221222.1\u00a0\u00b0C to \u22123.7\u00a0\u00b0C, and homogenization occurs into the liquid phase (L\u00a0+\u00a0V\u00a0\u2192\u00a0L) with Th from 274\u00a0\u00b0C to 309\u00a0\u00b0C with a median of 290\u00a0\u00b0C. Salinities (eq. w(NaCl)) range from 6.0 to 23.1\u00a0eq. w(NaCl), with median pressure (Md) estimations of 5.0\u00a0MPa.\nLw1 inclusions hosted in tremolite display Tmice between \u221216.6\u00a0\u00b0C and \u22121.5\u00a0\u00b0C, and Th ranging between 195\u00a0\u00b0C and 330\u00a0\u00b0C with a median of 305\u00a0\u00b0C. The calculated salinities range from 2.6 to 19.9\u00a0eq. w(NaCl) with a median of 12.1\u00a0eq. w(NaCl) and estimated pressures are in the range of 1.3\u00a0MPa to 11.8\u00a0MPa, with a median of 8.7\u00a0MPa. Fluid inclusions in tourmaline are small (5\u00a0\u00b5m), therefore only eight complete measurements were performed, with Tmice ranging between \u22126\u00a0\u00a0\u00b0C and \u22120.5\u00a0\u00b0C and Th from 420\u00a0\u00b0C to 460\u00a0\u00b0C (Md\u00a0=\u00a0425\u00a0\u00b0C). Correspondent salinities range from 0.9 to 9.2\u00a0eq. w(NaCl) with a median of 2.1\u00a0eq. w(NaCl), and the pressure estimations range from 27.6\u00a0MPa to 32.4\u00a0MPa, with a median of 29.8\u00a0MPa.\nFirst ice melting temperatures (Te) measured in Lw2 F\u00cds hosted by quartz, range from \u221233\u00a0\u00b0C to \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C, with a median of \u221226\u00a0\u00b0C. Tmice ranges from \u221214.3\u00a0\u00b0C to \u22120.1\u00a0\u00b0C and Th(L+V\u2192L) are between 125\u00a0\u00b0C and 327\u00a0\u00b0C with a median of 226\u00a0\u00b0C. Salinities range from 1.7 to 15.3\u00a0eq. w(NaCl), with a correspondent eq. w(NaCl) median of 6.5, with pressure estimations between 0.3\u00a0MPa and 19.7\u00a0MPa (Md\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u00a0MPa).\nMethane-rich fluid inclusions hosted in quartz (Fig. 12\nh) exhibited similar behaviors through the cooling runs (up to the \u2212196.6\u00a0\u00b0C), and although triple point temperature of CH4 was reached (\u2212182.5\u00a0\u00b0C) inclusions did not completely freeze. As shown by early studies from Roedder (1984), CH4-rich fluid inclusions can sustain a metastable behavior through temperatures much lower than the triple point, thus not allowing salinity estimations. Microthermometry of these inclusions revealed phase transitions below the critical temperature of CH4 (\u221282.6\u00a0\u00b0C), with TmCH4 between \u2212143.5\u00a0\u00b0C and \u2212136.3\u00a0\u00b0C when homogenizing in the liquid-phase (LCH4) and between \u2212141.0\u00a0\u00b0C and \u2212136.0\u00a0\u00b0C when homogenization into the vapor (VCH4) phase occurs. Although the aqueous portion of the CH4-rich inclusions is particularly small (approx. 5%), Tmice was limitedly observed in the range of \u22126.2\u00a0\u00b0C and \u22120.9\u00a0\u00b0C. Pressure at CH4 homogenization was estimated between 0.35\u00a0MPa and 0.54\u00a0MPa for LCH4 and between 0.41\u00a0MPa and 0.55\u00a0MPa for VCH4 (Table 2).\n\n\n\n4.5\nSulfides, gold, and silicate geochemistry\nA total of 278 EPMA spot analyses were performed in arsenopyrite (159), pyrite (48), gold (7), tourmaline (13), chlorite (18), and feldspars (23). Sample selection was done after a detailed mineralogical description and SEM-EDS analysis. The microprobe raw results can be consulted in \nSupplementary Material\n\nB.\nArsenopyrite composition (Table 3\n) was acquired both for Apy A and Apy B, with As weight content below the typical stoichiometric composition for arsenopyrite (46\u00a0wt%), with a median of 41.25\u00a0wt% for the complete arsenopyrite data.\nEPMA analysis considered the zoning observed in backscattered electron imagery, revealing Apy A arsenic content varying from 38.14\u00a0wt% to 43.06\u00a0wt% (Md\u00a0=\u00a041.55\u00a0wt%) in crystal cores and from 40.05\u00a0wt% to 41.26\u00a0wt% (Md\u00a0=\u00a040.44\u00a0wt%) at the rims.\nApy B revealed As contents ranging from 40.45\u00a0wt% to 41.76\u00a0wt% (Md\u00a0=\u00a041.06\u00a0wt%) in the crystal cores and between 39.70\u00a0wt% and 40.78\u00a0wt% (Md\u00a0=\u00a040.03\u00a0wt%) in the arsenic-depleted patchy areas (Fig. 8\nk). Although gold was analyzed as a trace element no concentrations above EPMA limits of detection (LOD; 308\u00a0ppm) were present. Both types of arsenopyrite displayed suitable values of Fe (<34.3 at. %), for the application of the arsenopyrite geothermometer (Kretschmar and Scott, 1976).\nMicroprobe analysis of Py A and Py B (Table 3) revealed faint variation in As content, reinforcing their petrographic distinction (Fig. 9). Py A revealed arsenic values mostly below LOD (1734\u00a0ppm). Whereas, in Py B, the concentration of As ranges from 0.18\u00a0wt% to 0.71\u00a0wt% (Md\u00a0=\u00a00.32\u00a0wt%). Although none of the above-mentioned pyrite types is considered As-rich, Py B shows a slight arsenic enrichment.\nGold hosted in Apy A from type i mineralization style revealed Au values ranging from 85.56\u00a0wt% to 86.29\u00a0wt% (Table 4\n), and Ag values between 13.15\u00a0wt% and 13.56\u00a0wt%. Low values of Fe were also detected, whereas the remaining analyzed elements are below EPMA LOD (disclosed in Table 4). Arsenopyrite-rich layers from type i mineralization display small gold grains with Au contents of 91.80\u00a0wt% and Ag contents of 7.08\u00a0wt%. Due to the small gold particle size, only one isolated gold particle was analyzed in these type i mineralized sections.\nGold filling microfractures in pyrite B from type ii mineralization shows a slightly different composition, with lower Au (between 80.54\u00a0wt% and 82.90\u00a0wt%) and higher Ag (between 16.83\u00a0wt% and 18.68\u00a0wt%) concentrations.\nEPMA analysis were used to calculate gold fineness (Fisher, 1945), with results ranging from 863 to 868 for gold filling Apy A fractures from type i mineralization and from 812 to 831 for gold in Py B from type ii mineralization. The single free gold particle from type i showed the higher fineness value of 928.\nMicroprobe analysis was performed in mineral phases found on the host rocks of gold mineralization, as an auxiliary method to characterize the degree of hydrothermal alteration. This study was mostly applied to secondary minerals, namely feldspar from Qz IIb veins, and chlorite accompanying gold-bearing pyrite from to type ii mineralization (sample shown in Fig. 9\nb).\nFeldspar characterization was performed using the microprobe analysis (Table 5\n; \nSupplementary Material\n\nB) on samples of Escoural Fm. paragneisses, Carvalhal Fm. basic metavolcanic rocks, and veins crosscutting the Monfurado Fm acid metavolcanis rocks, based on An, Ab and Or percentages applying the classification diagram from Fig. 14\n\na. The results show that the paragneiss and basic metavolcanic rocks are mainly composed of orthoclase, whereas the analyzed feldspars from veins that crosscut acid metavolcanic rocks of rhyolite affinity are mainly albite (Ab84%; Table 5).\nChlorites were selected from samples of Qz IIb-plagioclase-pyrite veins that crosscut the acid metavolcanic rocks and are found to be related to type ii mineralization, therefore allowing the comparison between the chlorite geothermometer and the fluid inclusion data (Table 2) from Qz IIb (Fig. 12\na \u2013 d). The selected samples correspond to trioctahedral chlorites, classified as clinochlore by the Mg \u2013 Al+ - Fe classification diagram (Fig. 14\nb). The chlorite geothermometer was performed after Cathelineau (1988) using the EPMA data (Table 5\n;\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nB).\nAdditionally, tourmaline crystals hosted in Qz IIa quartz crosscutting acid metavolcanic rocks (Fig. 4\nd, e) were selected for microprobe analysis (Table 5; \nSupplementary Material\n\nB). The classification diagram using the Na \/ (Na\u00a0+\u00a0Ca) in the\u00a0X\u00a0site and Fe \/ (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Mg) in the Y site (Fig. 14\nc) classify the samples as dravite.\n\n\n4.6\nSulfur isotopes data (\u03b434SCDT)\nIn the type i mineralization, the \u03b434SCDT was measured in arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and pyrite. Apy A has values from 10.1 \u2030 to 10.3 \u2030 (Table 6\n), comparable to those found in Apy B, with a \u03b434SCDT of 10.6 \u2030. Pyrite (Py A) shows signatures from 9.5 and 9.6 \u2030 (Table 6), whereas pyrrhotite revealed lighter \u03b434SCDT values, from 8.5\u2030 and 9.7 \u2030. In type ii mineralization, the \u03b434SCDT of the pyrite (Py B) shows a value of 10.2 \u2030.\nTo compare \u03b434SCDT signatures, pyrites from the pre-ore stages were selected for sulfur source differentiation. Pyrites ubiquitously disseminated in the marbles, possibly diagenetic, yield \u03b434SCDT signature of 13.7 \u2030 heavier than that of ore stage sulfides. The pyrites interpreted as being contemporary of the SEDEX-VMS iron mineralization events display contrasting \u03b434SCDT signatures of 3 \u2030 (Table 6) lighter than those of the ore-stage.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nDepositional stages\nThe Monfurado prospect is not only an interesting and complex case study from the Escoural gold district (Fig. 1\nb, d), as it is also an example of gold deposition that can be compared to worldwide Orogenic Gold deposits. In summary, two main gold mineralization types characterize the deposit: Type i mineralization is parallel to the host rock layering, with gold found in arsenopyrite (Apy A and Apy B) and pyrite (Py A) disseminated in massive sulfide layers (Fig. 8\na-c) and mostly deposited in microfractures in those minerals (Fig. 8\nl, m). The presence of magnetite substitution by pyrrhotite suggest that fluid-rock interactions might have assisted gold deposition in type i mineralization.\nType ii mineralization occurs in veins parallel to bedding, in which gold is found to be hosted in pyrite (Py B) microfractures, usually accompanied by chlorite and quartz, and found in veins exclusively crosscutting the acid metavolcanic unit. The development of these veins is structurally controlled by late brittle deformation.\nThe identification of the paragenetic sequence is supported by the petrographic and mineralogical data, and is reinforced by the isotopic and geochemical data, constituting what is here described as the main gold stage (Fig. 11).\nType i mineralization has never been described for the Escoural gold district (Fig. 1\nb, d), whereas type ii shows a mode of occurrence similar to what is found in other deposits of the district (e.g. Casas Novas, Chamin\u00e9) where gold mainly occurs in quartz lodes, with chloritization of the host rocks, in arsenopyrite-loellingite-pyrite-gold assemblages associated with native bismuth and bismuthinite (Ribeiro et al., 1993). Such features are consistent to type ii mineralization at the Monfurado prospect, where gold deposition is sometimes accompanied by hedleyite (Fig. 9\nk; Fig. 10\nf)\nWhen inspecting gold fineness (Table 4) it becomes evident that gold from type i shows higher values (863\u2013868) than those from type ii gold (812\u2013831) which reinforces the distinct petrographic criteria.\n\n\n5.2\nThermal and fluid evolution constraints\nFluid inclusion studies are extremely important in identifying the P-T-V-x conditions of the fluids responsible for gold transport in orogenic gold deposits, as well as in understanding host rock interactions promoted by those fluids, such as sulfidation and carbonation (Palin and Xu, 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Hodkiewicz et al., 2009; LaFlamme et al., 2018a; Petrella et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the discussion regarding the fluid evolution of orogenic gold deposits is quite vast and presents weaknesses pointed out in detail by Goldfarb et al. (2005) and Goldfarb and Groves (2015). Ubiquitously, H2O-CO2-H2S(\u00b1CH4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0N2) reduced fluids, with low salinities have been identified in phanerozoic orogenic gold deposits, with temperatures ranging from 250\u00a0\u00b0C to 400\u00a0\u00b0C (Bierlein and Crowe, 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Bodnar et al., 2014; Wyman et al., 2016).\nThe settings in which orogenic gold deposits occur are commonly associated with metasedimentary successions and metabasaltic rocks (Pitcairn et al., 2015) affected by greenschist to amphibolic regional metamorphism, displaying complex tectonic activity in which cyclic shear re-activations leads to successive fracturing and filling during several fluid circulation stages. This tectonism usually results in intricate fluid inclusion assemblages with unclear relation with ore deposition stages. The complexity of these hydrothermal systems often leads to uncertain fluid inclusion data interpretations, with unclear identification of the fluids responsible for ore transport (Groves et al., 2019).\nAreas as the Monfurado gold prospect are examples of the above-mentioned fluid complexity, in which interpretation of fluids is highly conditioned by the geodynamic processes that occurred in pre- and post-ore deposition times. Nevertheless, the identification and characterization of the dominant fluids present in this hydrothermal system were possible. Combining the fluid inclusions results with arsenopyrite and chlorite geothermometer estimations allowed to describe the thermal evolution of the system.\nLw1 inclusions (Fig. 13), especially those studied in tourmaline (dravite; Fig. 14), reflect the presence of fluids with higher temperature (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) and under higher pressure (>30\u00a0MPa), contrasting to Lw2 inclusions. Most quartz samples in which Lw2, LCH4\/VCH4 were identified correspond to late quartz-chlorite-feldspar veins that crosscut acid metavolcanic rocks (Fig. 12\na-d) in which gold-bearing Py B (Fig. 9\nb) is found. Lw2 fluid inclusions are ubiquitous in quartz (Qz IIb), and microthermometry revealed relatively low temperatures (Md\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinities (Md\u00a0=\u00a06.0 % eq. w(NaCl)), which are values compatible with the ones described for other orogenic gold deposits (Fig. 15\n\na; Wilkinsson, 2001; Bodnar et al., 2014). Furthermore, Cathelineau (1988) geothermometer was applied to selected chlorite crystals, sampled from the same veins in which Lw2 inclusions were identified (Fig. 12\na-d). The chlorite geothermometer indicates temperatures ranging from 229\u00a0\u00b0C to 309\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 5\n;\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nB), with average temperatures of 253\u00a0\u00b0C, which are compatible to those obtained from Lw2 inclusions hosted in quartz (Fig. 15\na).\nArsenopyrite geothermometer was performed using the EPMA data following Kretshmar and Scott (1976) criteria. This methodology was applied assuming a pyrite-arsenopyrite equilibrium (Table 7\n). Crystal cores of Apy A show an As at. % content from 28.05 at. % to 30.43 at. % corresponding to a temperature range from 239\u00a0\u00b0C to 372\u00a0\u00b0C that are overlapped by the obtained temperatures for Apy B, indicating temperatures ranging from 252\u00a0\u00b0C to 308\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 16\n) and a mean log a(S2)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210.8 for crystal cores.\nThe slight As depletion found in Apy A crystal rims leads to a range of estimated temperatures from 213\u00a0\u00b0C to 279\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 7), suggesting a decrease in temperature from the center towards the rims. Sulfur fugacity also decreases from the cores (log a(S2)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210.5) to the rims (log a(S2)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221212.73; Fig. 16\n;\nTable 7) as a consequence of the lower arsenic contents.\nApy B also displayed As depleted areas with a patch zonation, to which temperature estimations from 188\u00a0\u00b0C to 246\u00a0\u00b0C and mean log a(S2)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221212.7 (Table 7) were obtained.\nBoth arsenopyrites from massive sulfide layers (Apy A) and arsenopyrite-rich layers (Apy B) from mineralization type i (Fig. 8\nc) revealed similar arsenopyrite geothermometer (Fig. 16) and sulfur activity estimations which indicates that the processes that led to their formation are very similar. Additionally, the progressively lower P-T registered by fluid inclusions (Fig. 15\nb), is consistent with the chemical composition and correspondent geothermometer estimations attributed to arsenopyrite deposition.\n\n\n5.3\nSulfide \u03b434SCDT signatures\nSulfur isotopic composition of sediment-hosted orogenic gold deposits, such as the Escoural gold district, share a similar trend to the seawater sulfate curve throughout geological time (Chang et al., 2008; Groves et al., 2020a,b). Such evidence suggests that sulfur in these deposits is originated from reduced seawater sulfate, fractionated by biogenic or abiogenic processes, which justifies the lighter \u03b434SCDT signatures found in sulfides from orogenic gold deposits. Considering this, the gathered \u03b434SCDT isotopic signatures of sulfides from the Monfurado ore assemblage suggest a sulfur fractionation of around 10 \u2030 to 20 \u2030 (coherent with abiogenic fractionation) from the initial seawater sulfate signature (Chang et al., 2008), considering the Neoproterozoic carbonaceous metasediments from Escoural Fm. to be the main sulfur provider to the system. The narrow \u03b434SCDT values of the ore assemblage sulfides (Table 6), from 8.5 \u2030 to 10.6 \u2030 (Fig. 17\n), indicate that although local paragenetic differences exist (Fig. 11), they share the same sulfur sources and are affected by the same, or at least similar, sulfur fractionation processes (LaFlamme et al., 2018a). Furthermore, the narrow \u03b434SCDT variation, although revealing a slight shift in pyrrhotite towards lower \u03b434SCDT values, suggest that the variation of fO2 in the fluid was not significant for major destabilization of Au(HS)2\n-, and therefore fluid oxidation is unlikely a major control on Au deposition as suggested by the sulfidation reaction modelling presented by Petrella et al. (2021).\nThe data obtained by different authors, for other NW Iberian gold districts, both in Portugal and Spain, are displayed in Fig. 17. Similar \u03b434SCDT signatures were obtained in the NW Spain Vilalba gold district (Martinez-Abad et al., 2015) and Llamas de Cabrera (G\u00f3mez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012), both hosted in Lower Palaeozoic metasediments, with positive values between 2.7 \u2030 and 10.9 \u2030 and from 8 \u2030 to 23.1 \u2030, respectively. Gold districts in NW Portugal, hosted in granite rocks, have distinct \u03b434SCDT values with contrastingly negative signatures. Examples of these differences are, the Limarinho deposit (\u22129.2 \u2030 \u2013 \u22121.6 \u2030; Fuertes-Fuentes et al., 2016) and the Santo Ant\u00f3nio (Penedono) gold deposit (\u22125.3 \u2030 \u2013 \u22123.6 \u2030; Neiva et al., 2019).\nThis study found meaningful \u03b434SCDT differences in massive pyrites, possibly related with the SEDEX-VMS ores, and diagenetic pyrites hosted in marbles from the Monfurado Fm., with \u03b434SCDT values of 3 \u2030 and 13.7 \u2030 respectively (Fig. 17). The difference of these values, when compared to sulfide phases representative of the ore stage, suggest a significant change in the sulfur fractionation throughout the geodynamic evolution of the area.\n\n\n5.4\nPossible gold source and deposition mechanisms\nThe geodynamic controls of OMZ favored the formation and preservation of several types of mineral deposits, from the ones related to the early rift stage (e.g. Cambrian SEDEX-VMS Montemor-o-Novo iron ore deposits) to the Carboniferous orogenic gold deposits under study. The compressional and oblique collision developed crustal-scale strike-slip shears, such as the MNSZ, and supra-crustal thermal anomalies that promoted the hydrothermal fluid circulation through dehydration of metal-rich sedimentary basins. Such crustal anisotropies acted as a pathway for metal-enriched metamorphic fluids, and at the same time conditioned the regional tectono-metamorphic regimes that favored the formation of orogenic gold systems (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Groves et al., 2020a,b). Combining these geodynamic conditions and considering the gathered data in this research, it is proposed that the Monfurado case study displays a distinct orogenic gold occurrence in SW Iberia, in which a supracrustal metamorphic model (Groves et al., 2019) is the most adequate to explain the genesis of these deposits (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Groves and Santosh, 2016). The Escoural gold district displays structural features that correlate it with an orogenic gold model, and the research here presented suggests that local redox destabilization promoted by fluid-rock interactions are the main control on gold deposition related to type i mineralization, which is the main type at the Monfurado gold prospect. In other Escoural gold district deposits, such as the Casas Novas, Chamin\u00e9 and Bra\u00e7os, gold mineralization is mainly hosted in quartz-arsenopyrite veins associated with brittle deformation and crosscutting the Escoural Fm. (Ribeiro et al., 1993; Inverno, 2001; Lopes et al., 2015; Lopes, 2015), whereas in the Monfurado prospect two types of gold mineralization were identified.\nThrough this work evidence for metamorphic derived fluids being responsible for Au transport at the Escoural gold district were found. The most likely origin for such fluids is the devolatilization of the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary basement, locally represented by the Escoural Fm., which could also be a key provider of Au and S. Nevertheless, Pitcairn et al. (2015) recently discussed the possibility of trace amounts of Au, at the ppb levels, being remobilized from adjacent metabasaltic host rocks, such as the ones belonging to the Carvalhal Fm, which opens the possibility for other metal providers. For such devolatilization processes to occur several tectonic events can be invoked, such as i) slab break-off (Jesus et al., 2007; Pin et al., 2008; Ribeiro et al., 2010) and correspondent asthenosphere upwelling (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015); ii) radiogenic heat, provided by upper crust lithological pilling (Ribeiro et al., 2007) or even iii) igneous activity associated with the emplacement of magmatic bodies (e.g. Jesus et al., 2007; Moita et al., 2009).\nOur research suggests that reduced metamorphic fluids capable of transporting gold in bisulfide complexes (Au(HS)2\n-) were enrolled in the process, as indicated by the presence of CH4-fluids. One new type of gold mineralization (type i) has been identified in the Escoural gold district, in which gold deposition is believed to be triggered by the interaction of the reduced Au transporting fluids and the iron oxide-rich host rocks.\nAdditionally, the inspection of gold fineness reveals overall values from 812 and 868 which are consistent values for orogenic gold deposits (Morrison et al., 1991). Gold particle fineness is slightly higher for the type i mineralization (863\u2013868) when compared to type ii (812\u2013831) which, as pointed out by other authors (Pa\u013ayanova, 2008; Petrella et al., 2021), could suggest different ore sources or different ore deposition mechanisms associated to the same mineralizing event. Considering that sulfides from type i and type ii mineralization show very narrow \u03b434SCDT signatures it is suggested that the source for sulfur is the same for both types (Fig. 17) and therefore the differences in gold fineness are most likely associated to different ore deposition mechanisms being enrolled with type i and type ii mineralization.\n\n5.4.1\nType i mineralization: Sulfidation processes\nFor type i Au mineralization, destabilizing conditions for gold deposition were met when the initially reduced fluid interacted with the magnetite-rich host rocks (Monfurado Fm.). Sulfur concentrations in the fluid promoted magnetite sulfidation (Phillips and Groves, 1984; Phillips, 1986; Phillips and Hughes, 1996; Goldfarb et al., 2005), resulting in magnetite replacement by pyrrhotite (Palin and Xu, 2000, Fig. 7\na, b). Sulfidation reactions are an important alteration associated to gold deposition in orogenic gold deposits (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Petrella et al., 2020; Petrella et al., 2021), and are here interpreted as the main control for the deposition of gold in type i mineralization. The interaction between the reduced fluids transporting Au(HS)-\n2 and the iron-rich host rocks from the Monfurado Fm. led to the deposition of pyrrhotite by substitution of magnetite and coeval deposition of sulfides such as arsenopyrite and pyrite. The deposition of these sulfide phases result in the consumption of H2S from the fluid, thus leading to Au(HS)-\n2 destabilization and consequent gold deposition. These processes have been thoroughly discussed by Petrella et al. (2021), which disclose the chemical reactions that result from this fluid-rock interaction.\nThe fact that most of the gold particles from type i are found in arsenopyrite, suggests that arsenopyrite served as an electrochemical trap for Au (M\u00f6ller and Kersten, 1994; Dubosq et al., 2018), which raises the question of Au possibly being incorporated in the atomic structure of arsenopyrite during its deposition as thoroughly discussed by Pokrovski et al. (2021). Post deposition metamorphism and deformation could have been an important mechanism in scavenging Au from arsenopyrite and pyrite structure (Fougerouse et al., 2016), leading to its deposition as fracture filling in type i mineralization.\nType i gold mineralization is exclusive to the Monfurado prospect and is part of the main gold mineralization stage, corresponding to gold grades up to 5.3\u00a0g\/ton through an 8-meter section in one of the drill cores (Fig. 2). The contrasting rheological properties between the acid metavolcanic rocks and the carbonated units of the Monfurado Fm. are responsible for the focusing of type i gold mineralization endowment in these sections. This lithological contact served as an anisotropy for fluid circulation, thus focusing the fluid-rock interactions in the highly permeable iron-rich carbonate units of the Monfurado Fm. whereas, in the acid metavolcanic rocks, brittle-vein emplacement occurred. The result of sulfidation reactions (Fig. 7\na, b) can be observed throughout the structural pathway in which a laterally consistent sulfide layer (MSL) was generated, which is observable in all core logs. The acid metavolcanics unit served as a low permeability barrier, concentrating fluid circulation at its base, and sulfidation reactions occurred in the lower calcsilicate \/carbonate unit (Fig. 2; Fig. 3).\n\n\n5.4.2\nType ii mineralization: Evidence of reduced fluids\nType ii mineralization is found in quartz-veins (Qz IIb) hosted in acid metavolcanic rocks (Fig. 12\na-d), contrasting to type i mineralization and thus suggesting that this mineralization type is structurally controlled. The veins bearing this mineralization type are usually sub-horizontal and parallel to the structural pathway, which is interpreted to be focused in the MSL.\nReduced CH4-rich and H2O-NaCl fluids were found in quartz from Qz IIb veins, and presumably assisted ore transport (Fig. 9\na;\nFig. 12\nh, j). The presence of CH4-pure fluid inclusions is particularly interesting and indicates that such fluids are generated under reduced conditions, coherent to the fluids sustaining gold transport in bisulfide complexes (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Phillips and Powell, 2010; Pokrovski et al., 2014, Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). Several geological events are prone to contribute with CH4 to the ore-forming fluids, from biogenic to abiotic sources (Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013). One commonly considered source of CH4 is the thermal degradation of organic matter by the reactions between metamorphic-hydrothermal fluids and organic-rich and carbonate-rich rocks, during regional metamorphism (Fan et al., 2004; Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013; Gaboury, 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). Such reactions can be the main CH4 supplier at the Monfurado gold prospect, owing to the metamorphism and metasomatism that affected the Escoural Fm. metasediments, and the Monfurado Fm. carbonate-rich units. A recent review by Gaboury (2021) addresses the role of organic matter on the formation of orogenic gold deposits since carbonaceous shales, such as the ones from Escoural Fm., are usually attributed as a common gold source. This evidence, together with the \u03b434SCDT values from Py B (Table 6; Fig. 17) is consistent with an input of sulfur, and possibly gold, from this Neoproterozoic basement.\nIn summary, the transport of gold was possibly assisted by CH4-rich fluids and the partitioning of H2S into the vapor and non-aqueous phases, such as CH4, could impose destabilization of Au(HS)-\n2 complexes and subsequent gold deposition in type ii mineralization, as suggested by Naden and Shepherd (1989).\nAqueous-carbonic (Lc-w) fluid inclusions were exclusively found in clear-quartz veins cross-cutting the calcsilicate rocks of the Monfurado Fm., indicative that H2O-CO2-NaCl fluids have been locally incorporated in the system, and although such fluids are commonly found in orogenic gold deposits, in this case, such association could not be clearly disclosed.\nThe aqueous fluid inclusions found in Qz IIb veins revealed the presence of low-salinity (Md\u00a0=\u00a06.0\u00a0eq. w(NaCl)) and lower-temperature (Md\u00a0=\u00a0230\u00a0\u00b0C) H2O-NaCl fluids, coherent with the chlorite and arsenopyrite geothermometer (Table 5\n;\nFig. 15\na). Such temperatures indicate probable input of meteoric water to the system (Lw2;\nFig. 15), although linking it to gold deposition was not possible.\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n\n6.1\nVectoring future mineral exploration\nThe research approach presented throughout this work proved suitable for providing valuable insights on gold deposition mechanisms at the particularly interesting case study of the Escoural Orogenic gold district, the Monfurado gold prospect (Fig. 1).\nThe Monfurado gold prospect corresponds to a complex occurrence of gold displaying a unique mineralization style (type i) in which gold deposition was assisted by sulfidation processes that had not been recognized in the Escoural gold district (Fig. 1\na). The spatial association of this gold prospect with the Santiago do Escoural fault and the precedent iron ores opens the possibility for other gold prospects to be found in the vicinity of this regional geological structures.\nConsidering the geochemistry, fluid inclusions, and isotopic data, the Neoproterozoic metasediments (i.e. Escoural Fm.) are suggested to be the most likely sulfur and gold supplier to the system. However, the role of the Cambrian volcanogenic iron-rich rocks from the Monfurado Fm. and metabasites from the Carvalhal Fm. (Table 1) as a source of metals is unknown and must not be ruled out considering the present evidence.\nAdditionally, the identification of gold-bearing sulfide layers - i.e. massive and arsenopyrite-rich - constitutes a valuable exploration vectoring tool for the sector. Understanding the role of the pre-existing iron-oxide domains in the evolution of the system provided insights for new gold deposition mechanisms and supports the possible existence of uncovered gold mineralization associated with the remaining massive iron bodies. Future exploration projects could benefit from this approach, focusing prospects on the contact between the acid metavolcanic and carbonate rocks from the Monfurado Fm., and addressing the relation between gold deposition and the iron-rich host rocks.\n\n\n","45":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nEpithermal systems are intrusion-related hydrothermal systems that mostly form in subaerial volcanic arcs at upper crustal levels and at temperatures of\u00a0<\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b0C (Simon et al., 2005; Cooke and Simmons, 2000; Hedenquist et al., 2000; Wade et al., 2014). These systems produce three types of geothermal fluids, which are classified according to their major anion compositions (Pirajno, 2012; Renaut and Jones, 2003; 2011) and include: (1) carbonate-rich fluids often producing travertine (CaCO3) deposits (Fouke et al., 2000; Pentecost, 2003); (2) alkali chloride fluids with neutral pH waters often saturated with amorphous silica, which typically precipitate siliceous sinter deposits characteristically opal-A (White et al., 1964; White et al., 1988), and (3) acid-sulfate fluids, which are generally low in chlorides and pH, the latter of which comes from H2S oxidation to H2SO4. The mixture of acidic solutions with chloride-rich fluids from deep reservoirs can result in the dissolution of host rocks and precipitate kaolin, alunite, and silica residue minerals near the surface rocks (Ellis and Mahon, 1977; Hedenquist and Browne, 1989; Mountain and Seward, 2003; Jones and Renaut, 2012; Drake et al., 2014).\nWhen the mixture is composed of alkali chloride fluids instead of acid sulphate fluids, silica sinter systems may be formed by the circulations hydrothermal fluids (Sillitoe, 1993; Guido and Campbell, 2011), which provides a host environment for thermophilic bacteria that can adapt to extreme conditions (Cady and Farmer, 1996; Jones and Renaut, 2003; Campbell et al., 2015; Des Marais and Walter, 2019, Kyle et al., 2007; Kyle and Schroeder, 2007). The most exemplary of fossil geothermal silica sinters are those preserved in the Miocene and Pliocene Kohuamuri deposits in the Hauraki Goldfield from New Zealand, the Jurassic samples from the Deseado Massif, Argentina, and the Drummond Basin Paleozoic hot spring sinter from Queensland, Australia and Miocene Ovac\u0131k epithermal deposit from Turkey (Guido and Campbell, 2011; Dill et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2019; Guido and Campbell, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2019). Examples of modern and sub-recent silica sinters occur in the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand, the hot springs and geysers of El Tatio, Chile, Yellowstone National Park in the USA, and the Uzon Caldera in Kamchatka Russia (Cunneen and Sillitoe, 1989; Herdianita et al., 2000; Braunstein and Lowe, 2001; Campbell et al., 2001; Blank et al., 2002; McKenzie, et al., 2001; Lynne and Campbell, 2003; Fernandez-Turiel et al., 2005; Orange et al., 2013; Drake et al., 2014; Lynne et al., 2019; Chaves Torres et al., 2019; Churchill et al., 2020; Kyle et al., 2007).\nThe water\u2013rock interactions are complex processes that usually result in the production of intermingled alkali chloride and the acid spring deposits. However, it is possible to distinguish geothermal fluid-related deposits based on their mineralogical composition, geochemical and textural properties with their extent in outcrops and biological content (Jones et al., 2000; Mountain and Seward, 2003; Lynne et al., 2006; Schinteie et al., 2007; Jones and Renaut, 2012; Murphy et al., 2021; Jones and Renaut, 2003; Lynne and Campbell, 2003; Drake et al., 2014).\nThe Biga Peninsula in northwestern Turkey (Fig. 1\n) has developed numerous extensive epithermal systems including low- to high-sulphidation ore deposits (\u00c7i\u00e7ek et al., 2021; Dill et al., 2015; Ece et al., 2008, 2013; Pirajno, 1995; \u00dcnal Ercan et al., 2016; Yi\u011fit, 2012; Ayd\u0131n, 2014; Ece and Schroeder, 2007). Siliceous and silicified deposits used by today\u2019s industries in the region, have been known for centuries. Our scientific studies were aimed at constraining the temporal and spatial changes of fossil epithermal systems and focused on acid-sulfate fluids related to advanced argillic alteration minerals. To elucidate the temporal evolution of the fossil geothermal system in the region, it is necessary to study in detail the siliceous and silicified deposits precipitated from the end-member of the hydrothermal solutions.\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize silica microfacies and lithological properties of the silica sinter deposits in the Etili Fossil Silica Sinter Region (EFSSR). We hypothesize that ancient alkali chloride and acid-sulfate springs were manifesting within the fossil geothermal area, which resulted in silicification and alteration processes. Evidence to support this idea includes: X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission \u2013 scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), elemental analysis, and stable isotopic analysis on the host rock, altered samples, and siliceous and silicified samples.\n\n1.1\nGeological background\nWestern Anatolia is a well-known Tertiary post-collisional magmatic province, which developed over an amalgamated basement composed of oceanic and crustal tectonic slivers related to the Kazda\u011f Massif, Sakarya Continent, Rhodope Zone, Karakaya Complex and Intra-Pontide Suture (Okay et al., 1991; Okay and Satir, 2000; Beccaletto and Jenny, 2004; Okay and G\u00f6nc\u00fco\u011flu, 2004; \u015eeng\u00fcn and Koralay, 2017) (Fig. 1) (Okay et al., 1991; Okay and Satir, 2000; Beccaletto and Jenny, 2004; Okay and G\u00f6nc\u00fco\u011flu 2004; Beccaletto et al., 2005; Ayg\u00fcl et al. 2012; \u015eeng\u00fcn and Koralay, 2017). The magmatic activity in the region initiated in north of the Biga peninsula with emplacement of granitic plutons during the Middle Eocene, which intensified during Oligo-Miocene core complex exhumations (Fig. 1) and produced associated volcanic rocks up to Late Miocene (Aldanmaz et al., 2000; Altunkaynak and Dilek, 2006). Stratigraphic features and radiometric dating performed on volcanic rocks revealed that magmatism in the Biga Peninsula was not continuous and experienced a period of cessation between 14 and 11\u00a0Ma, which corresponds to the abrupt change from calc-alkaline plutonism-dominated (i.e. Karabiga \u015eevketiye, Kestanbol, Evciler and Eybek granitic plutons) to alkaline volcanism-dominated type under the control of the extentional tectonics in western Anatolia (Karac\u0131k and Y\u0131lmaz, 1998; Altunkaynak and Gen\u00e7, 2008).\nPlutonic and volcanic rocks in the study area, were defined to constitute the Bayrami\u00e7 magmatic complex (Gen\u00e7, 1998), which is grouped as; 1) Upper-Oligocene to Lower-Miocene, NE-SW oriented elliptical granodioritic bodies emplaced into the Kazda\u011f metamorphics; 2) Oligocene - Mid-Miocene intermediate to acidic lavas and pyroclastics, and 3) Upper-Miocene to Pliocene basaltic lavas. The Evciler pluton is a granodiorite, comprised of quartz monzonite, monzodiorite, and quartz diorite type felsic rocks, displaying metaluminous, high-K, calc-alkaline affinity and characterized by large ion lithophile element enrichments with Nb-Ta depletions similar to other exhumed plutons in the Biga Peninsula (Gen\u00e7, 1998).\nPrevious studies suggested the Evciler pluton is of Oligocene to Early Miocene age, based mostly on the field observations indicating that it was intruded into the Lower-Middle Miocene volcanic association and a well-developed\u00a0\u223c\u00a0150\u00a0m contact aureole (Siyako et al., 1989; Ercan et al., 1995; Gen\u00e7, 1998; Y\u0131lmaz and Karac\u0131k, 2001). This was been confirmed by radiometic age analysis performed on hornblende (40Ar\/39Ar: 25.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0Ma \u2013 28.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0Ma) and biotite (40K\/39Ar: 31.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma \u2013 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0Ma; 40Ar\/39Ar: 21.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0Ma \u2013 24.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0Ma; Rb\/Sr: 20.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u201325\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma) (Birkle and Satir, 1995; Gen\u00e7, 1998; Okay and Satir, 2000; Altunkaynak et al., 2012; Delaloye and Blngol, 2000; \u00d6zdamar et al., 2021). The relations between skarn deposits and magmatic activities were documented and the Evciler granitoid and classified as volcanic arc granites (VAG) and syn-collisional granites (\u00d6zt\u00fcrk et al., 2005).\nThe Oligocene-Middle Miocene volcanoclastic succession in the region is comprised of subaerial andesitic-trachyandesitic, basaltic andesitic lavas, dacitic-rhyolitic ignimbrite, pyroclastics and tuffs with intercalations of lacustrine deposits including lignite layers. They are collectively referred to as the \u00c7an volcanics (Ercan et al., 1995). Counterparts of \u00c7an volcanics extend from the Aegean Island to the Thrace basin in the north and to the Almac\u0131k mountains in the east (Seyito\u01f5lu et al., 1992; Ercan et al., 1995; Gen\u00e7, 1998). \u00c7an volcanics mostly constitute the widely recognized metallogenic deposits resulted from long-lasted reactivation of magmatism in the region during the Pliocene (Yi\u011fit, 2012; Ercan et al., 2016; Oyman, 2019). Extensive hydrothermal alteration of thick pyroclastic units of \u00c7an volcanics has resulted in the formation of economical kaolinite deposits.\nRocks of the Late Miocene-Pliocene epochs in the region are characterized by basaltic lavas and linked to the melting of asthenospheric mantle source (Aldanmaz et al., 2000). Red stained, coarse clastics rest unconformably over the Evciler pluton and \u00c7an volcanics. Upward in the section, lacustrine limestones predominant and display scarce alternations with olivine-rich basaltic lavas.\nThe outcrops and abandoned quarry pit exposures of the siliceous sinter deposits in the Etili, Hamamtepe and Muratlar are all developed within the thick andesitic lavas and pyroclastic units of the \u00c7an volcanics. They are often exposed and aligned with NE-SW and WNW-ESE trending faults constitute the Etili-Bayrami\u00e7 Fault Zone (Fig. 2\n).\nThe nature of the faults in the Biga Peninsula prior to the Early Miocene and their relation to the North Anatolian Fault zone (NAF) are debated, however, there is consensus that Etili, Yenice, and Edremit faults existed before NAF and during the Plio-Quaternary and they were merged to the NAF and became the western continuum of its southern branch; (Kaymakci et al., 2007; Le Pichon et al., 2014; Yalt\u0131rak and Alpar, 2002). Since the Miocene, the Anatolian Block has moved westward along the NAF, which is now a 1200\u00a0km long left-lateral strike-slip fault (Fig. 1) that also marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates (Okay et al., 1991, 1999). The NE-SW en echelon faults of the NAF zone in the Biga Peninsula are represented by (1) the Manyas-Dani\u015fment fault in the southeast, (2) the Yenice-G\u00f6nen fault in the middle, and (3) the Sar\u0131k\u00f6y-\u0130nova fault in the northwest. Our study site is located in the northern part of the Sarik\u00f6y-Inova fault zone, which extends to the \u00c7an-Etili-Bayrami\u00e7 fault zone.\n\n\n\n2\nMethods of the study\nA 1:25.000 scale geological map of the study area was prepared and representative samples were collected out of from either outcrops or high walls of open-pits for geochemical and isotopic analysis (Fig. 2). Representative samples were examined under a polarizing microscope. Minerals were further identified with a Bruker D8 Advance model X-ray diffraction (XRD), CuK\u03b1 radiation, running conditions of 40\u00a0mA, 40\u00a0kV, scan-speed 0.005\u00b0, time\/scan 0.1 sec, 0.2\u00a0mm primary slit and using a LynxEye detector at Istanbul Technical University (ITU) using standard preparation and mounting techniques (Hurst et al., 1997).\nMineral determinations and textural classifications were based on work by Lynne et al. (2007). Silica sinter deposits were examined for micro-morphological properties using an FEI Quanta FEG 250 model field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) in the Membrane Technologies Center, Istanbul Technical University. A SPI-MODULE\u00ae sputter coater was used for Au-Pd alloy coating under operating conditions of 2\u00a0mbar, 15\u00a0mA and 50\u00a0s. This provided a\u00a0\u223c\u00a0150\u00a0\u00c5 coating thickness. Operating conditions of FE-SEM were 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage, 5\u201315\u00a0mA current and 10\u201320\u00a0s counting time for each element.\nWhole-rock chemical analyses were performed at ACME Laboratory, Canada. Major and trace elements were analyzed using Spectro Ciros Vision ICP-OES in ACME for Ba, and Sc (0.2\u00a0g pulp sample by LiBO2 fusion) and Mo, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, As (0.5\u00a0g sample leached with 3\u00a0ml of 2\u20132\u20132 HCl-HNO3-H2O at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for one hour, diluted to 10\u00a0ml). Perkin-Elmer Elan 6100 ICP-MS used for other trace and REE elements in the ITU-Geochemistry Research Laboratory (JAL).\nNine alunite samples were analyzed for sulfur isotopes (\u03b434S). SO2 was produced by heating alunite at 1050\u00a0\u00b0C was analyzed by a Finnigan MAT 252 gas-source mass spectrometer. The \u03b434S values are reported relative to the reference standard, Canon Diablo Troilite (CDT). The accuracy is estimated to be\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030. The \u03b418O and \u03b4D values for kaolinite and \u03b418O values for quartz were measured using at the Finnigan MAT 252 or Finnigan Delta E spectrometry at the University of Georgia (UGA), Athens, USA. Laser produced O2 was converted to CO2 with heated graphite (Valley et al., 1995) with values reported relative to V-SMOW (Vienna - Standard Mean Ocean Water) with 2-sigma values of a reference material = \u00b10.4\u2030.\nSeven of the purest alunite samples were analyzed by XRD prior to being picked for 40Ar\/39Ar radiometric age analysis. Samples were analyzed at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA by the furnace step-heating method, which utilized a double vacuum resistance furnace similar in design to Staudacher et al. (1978). Details of the analytical methods and data treatment are given in Justet and Spell (2001) and Spell and McDougall (2003).\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nObservations from Hamamtepe and Muratlar silica sites\nThe Hamamtepe silica sinter deposit are located in the eastern part of the study area and occupies an area of approximately (125\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0125\u00a0m) 15,625\u00a0m2 (Fig. 2). It is regionally the largest silica quarry (abbreviated H on Fig. 2), with semi-circular dimensions of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0300\u00a0m wide and\u00a0\u223c\u00a030\u00a0m in depth. There are many smaller silica sinter pits in the vicinity of Hamamtepe currently being exploited for kaolinite (Fig. 2). These silica sinter deposits were hosted by the massive andesitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks of the \u00c7an volcanics. There are expressed in parallel branches of the \u00c7an-Etili fault system that trend NE-SW in the middle and south of the deposit. Many faults and fracture systems are developed perpendicular to the main faults in the sinter deposits.\nThe fossil Hamamtepe siliceous sinter formations occur as a massive grey colored quartz column in the middle of H1 (Fig. 2). Light and dark grey banding and fluctuations were commonly observed, also there are quartz veining breccias with alternation to altered zones. The Muratlar silica-rich site is located on the western part of the study area and occupies an area of approximately (250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0175\u00a0m (43,750\u00a0m2) (abbreviated to M on Fig. 2). Multiple outcrops of sinter deposits were found to be distributed along major NE-SW trending Etili fault and along with perpendicular fractures in the Muratlar region.\n\n\n3.2\nLithofacies of the EFSSR\nDistal and medial facies sinter morphologies with primary features were not detected in the Hamamtepe and Muratlar sites due to effects of erosion, diagenesis, deformation related to recent tectonism, and mining activities. Only proximal apron lithofacies were recognized to be preserved. These represent generally near-spring areas and silica infiltrate, spring conduits (geyser mound), nodular, and finely laminated geyserites (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n). Brecciated structures that resulted from hydrothermal explosions and extensively silicified volcanic rocks were found in Hamamtepe (Fig. 5\n) (Table 1\n). The Muratlar site consisted of many small mounds dominated by massive grey colored quartz with rare grey banding and fluctuations. Breccias with quartz veining are less in abundance at Muratlar (Fig. 5) (Table 1).\nFour distinct microbiota forms were observed by FE-SEM in the EFSSR and include: (1) retiform; (2) hyphae; (3) spherical cells, and (4) diatom frustules (Figs. 6a, b\n\n). All microfossils were observed in all deposits except for the microfossils identified from the M5 deposit, where diatom frustules were clearly visible in hand specimens.\n\n\n3.3\nMineralogy and petrography of the EFSSR\nThin section studies, XRD, and FE-SEM analysis revealed unaltered andesites near the EFSSR deposit that consist mainly of euhedral zoned and polysynthetic twinned plagioclase phenocrysts and lesser abundant biotite, amphibole, and clinopyroxene. Plagioclase was more affected by hydrothermal alteration processes than other framework silicates. The matrix of andesites consists of plagioclase microlites and glasses. The tuffs were generally massive and consisted of glass shards, plagioclase, and chloritized biotite phenocrysts with many showing silicification and altered following the hydrothermal alteration processes.\nBulk powdered XRD analysis revealed that the EFSSR to be composed predominantly of quartz with no evidence for silica polymorphs such as opal-A, opal-CT, or opal-C (Figs. 7, 8\n\n). The massive grey quartz of the silica deposits were generally formed as anhedral and euhedral microcrystalline quartz. Microcrystalline spherical quartz was often coated on other minerals surfaces (clay minerals, feldspar, euhedral-quartz) and anhedral quartz crystals was cemented between other minerals and fractures. Anhedral quartz ranged between\u00a0<\u00a00.5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm and euhedral quartz varied between 5 and 60\u00a0\u03bcm (Figs. 7, 8). Where anhedral and euhedral quartz coexist together (Fig. 7b, c, d; Fig. 8b, f, g), the euhedral quartz crystals ranged up to 60\u00a0\u03bcm in length and often infilled voids of primary porosity within the siliceous and silicified rocks (Fig. 7b,c,f), which occurs after the chalcedonic infilling event in some voids (Fig. 7d). Euhedral and anhedral quartz micro-veins were comprised of well-formed crystals smaller in size (\u223c1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm) (Fig. 7e). These quartz veins crosscut the rocks by the fractures and structural weaknesses and rarely linked voids of primary porosity in the siliceous and silicified rocks. Replacement textures of the phenocrystalline quartz by microcrystals quartz also occurred (Fig. 7g; Fig. 8e). Most of the Hamamtepe and Muratlar site samples appeared with 10 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm diameter primary quartz, which was partially replaced by microcrystalline quartz. It is suggested that this replacement quartz originated from silicified tuffs or it is syn-deposited primary quartz.\nAltered mineral assemblages were best observed in the H1 quarry for the Hamamtepe site and the M1 quarry for the Muratlar site. Alteration haloes of varying degrees appeared at these quarries, with zones reaching thicknesses of up to 30\u00a0m in H1 and 40\u00a0m in M1. The XRD analyses showed that alteration mineral assemblages comprised were of \u03b1-quartz, kaolinite, halloysite, alunite, and minor illite, jarosite, and smectite. Morphology observed in FE-SEM revealed two dominant kaolinite habits. The first habit detected at M1 was randomly oriented kaolinite crystals with dimensions between 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0\u00b5m. The other habit of kaolinite at H1 was vermiform booklet stacks of platelets that were occasionally found as equi-dimensional crystals between 0.5 and 2.0\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig. 9\na, b). Other features observed were partially dissolved feldspars and co-existing kaolin habits (Fig. 9b).\nHalloysite from the H1 showed open-ended tubular morphology with internal lumen diameters of 50\u201370\u00a0nm and outer diameters of 150\u2013250\u00a0nm (Fig. 9e,f,g). In contrast the halloysite from the M1 quarry, tubes were much shorter in length, with flat points and closed-ended (Fig. 9h), suggesting initial stages of transformation to kaolinite (Ercan et al., 2016). Pseudo-hexagonal alunite crystals from the Hamamtepe site varied from 200 to 500\u00a0\u00b5m in size. Dissolution pitting on the alunite was often observed (Fig. 9c-d). Well-defined examples of alunite undergoing co-precipitation with halloysite tubular structures were observed where these halloysite tubes mostly occurred at the edge of pseudo-hexagonal particles of alunite (Fig. 9 d).\n\n\n3.4\nGeochemistry of the EFSSR\nThree of the rock types were analyzed for chemistry and included: 1) twenty silica-rich samples representing siliceous and silicified deposits, 2) nine clay-rich samples representing the alteration products, and 3) three \u201cleast altered\u201d tuff samples (i.e., representing the host rocks).\nThe SiO2 contents of silica-rich samples from both Hamamtepe and Muratlar sites were higher than\u00a0>\u00a097\u00a0wt% (Table 2\n). Hamamtepe site samples have lower concentrations of trace elements (e.g., Ba 149 \u2013 2007\u00a0ppm, Sr 10.8 \u2013 86.9\u00a0ppm, Ce\u00a0<\u00a00.1 \u2013 0.8\u00a0ppm, La 0.2 \u2013 1\u00a0ppm, Y\u00a0<\u00a00.1 \u2013 1.9\u00a0ppm, As 1.4 \u2013 17.7\u00a0ppm, Au 8.10-4 to 0.1687, Hg 0.1 \u2013 0.46\u00a0ppm) when compared to the Muratlar samples (Ba: 19\u20131575\u00a0ppm; Sr: 3.6 and 118.4\u00a0ppm; Ce: 0.3 and 6.4\u00a0ppm; La: 0.1 and 4.1\u00a0ppm;, Y: 0.1 and 3.4\u00a0ppm; As: 0.5 to 298.5\u00a0ppm; Au: 8.10-4 to 0.0181\u00a0ppm; Hg: 0.1 to 0.18\u00a0ppm) (Table 2).\nThe altered samples contain high concentrations of Al2O3 (up to 36.5\u00a0wt%), SiO2 (up to 74.9\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (up to 12.2\u00a0wt%) and low Na2O, Ca2O and K2O (Table 1). These samples have high trace elements concentrations (Ba 471 to 3824\u00a0ppm, Sr 2894.7 to 18672.1\u00a0ppm, Ce 2.4 to 345.8\u00a0ppm, La 1.5 to 188.7\u00a0ppm, Y 1.4 to 82.2\u00a0ppm, Pb 3.2 to 63.8\u00a0ppm, As 112.1 to 2636.3. Cu (<133.3\u00a0ppm) and Au (<1.49\u00a0ppm) concentrations are extremely high (Table 2).\nThe slightly silicified host rock contains Al2O3 (up to 14.2\u00a0wt%), SiO2 (up to 68.9\u00a0wt%), Fe2O3 (up to 1.5\u00a0wt%) which are typical for andesites (Table 2). These samples also have low concentrations of Ba (608 to 921\u00a0ppm), Sr (205.6 to 599.4\u00a0ppm), Ce (62.064.5), La (30.2 to 33.6\u00a0ppm), Y (19.3 to 35.7\u00a0ppm), Pb (0.8 to 11.0\u00a0ppm), As (<0.5 to 3.2) and Cu (<17.2\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n3.5\nStable isotope geochemistry of the EFSSR\nThe altered EFSSR rocks had a very limited amount of pure alunite and therefore only allowed for \u03b434S isotopic analysis of three samples from the Hamamtepe site (H1, H2 quarries) and three samples from the Muratlar (M5, M6 quarries) site. The \u03b434S isotopic H1 alunite values (Table 3\n) were slightly depleted at \u22122.7 and \u22123.3 \u2030, whereas the H2 value was highly depleted at \u221219.6 \u2030. The \u03b434S isotopic values of the Muratlar samples were enriched at 9.2 and 10.5 \u2030 (M1) and 16.6 \u2030 (M5). Three \u03b434S isotopic values of the M1 samples measured by Ayd\u0131n (2014) have similarly enriched isotopic values reported at 8.6, 15.4, and 16.8 \u2030.\nThe \u03b418O values of the Hamamtepe site kaolin samples (H1 and H2 deposits) ranged from 9.4 \u2030 to 9.6 \u2030 and \u03b4D values ranged from \u221274 \u2030 to \u221284 \u2030. These \u03b418O and \u03b4D values were similar to those reported by Ayd\u0131n (2014), where the \u03b418O ranged from 10.3 to 12.2 \u2030 and \u03b4D ranged from \u221249 \u2030 to \u221282 \u2030. The \u03b418O values of siliceous and silicified samples of the Hamamtepe sites ranged from 11.4 \u2030 to 18.4 \u2030 (H1, H2, H3 and H5 deposits) and \u03b418O values of quartz samples of the Muratlar sites ranged from 8.3 \u2030 to 16.6 \u2030 (M1, M2, M7, M5 and M11 deposits).\n\n\n3.6\nGeochronology of the EFSSR\nNine alunite-rich samples collected from the kaolinite deposits were analyzed for 40Ar\/39Ar age dating with results shown in Table 3. Timing of hydrothermal alteration in the EFSSR can be grouped into three ranges that span from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene based on the ages from 40Ar\/39Ar dating: a) 28.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 to 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0Ma in the Muratlar site, b) 12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 to 15.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma in the northern zone of the Hamamtepe site, and c) 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 to 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma in the southern zone of the Hamamtepe site.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nSinter lithofacies properties and microbial preservation\nWe compared our studies to other silica sinter deposits associated with alkali chloride springs in active and fossil geothermal regions around the world to better understand the formation conditions of EFSSR. These deposits were thought to mostly formed from near-neutral pH alkali chloride solutions with oversaturated silica fluids. The chemical precipitation of silica sinters exhibits different characteristic lithofacies properties as reported by Fournier and Rowe (1966); Fournier (1985); Cady and Farmer (1996); Kyle et al. (2007); Kyle and Schroeder (2007); Lynne et al. (2008); Guido and Campbell (2011); and Lynne (2012). These lithofacies have been defined by their characteristic properties along a thermal gradient that goes from the hot water spring downward and away into the subsurface as the 1) proximal apron (65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C), 2) middle apron (45\u201365\u00a0\u00b0C) and finally 3) distal apron (<45\u00a0\u00b0C) (Cady and Farmer, 1996; Hamilton et al., 2019a). Sinters of different styles form at these points where the water table is heated by deep magmatic intrusions and the hydrothermal circulation of groundwater occurs along these gradients (Sillitoe, 1993; Guido and Campbell, 2011). These silica sinters often contain thermophilic bacteria, which have adapted to extreme conditions are very common in modern silica sinter formations (Kyle et al., 2007; Kyle and Schroeder, 2007). These sometimes form as rather thick mats and these environments probably were important habitats for ancient microbial ecosystems. It has even been postulated that life arose in hydrothermal systems (Cady and Farmer, 1996; Jones and Renaut, 2003; Campbell et al., 2015; Des Marais and Walter, 2019, Konhauser and Lalonde, 2010).\n\n\n4.2\nDefinition of the proximal apron lithofacies\nProximal apron lithofacies were the most common observed morphology in the EFSSR and are defined by conditions of high temperatures (>75\u00a0\u00b0C) and alkali chloride and silica-rich fluids that debouch at the Earth\u2019s surface immediate surrounding areas. Hot water pools, geysers, and springs are characteristic manifestations that develop in this proximal environment (Walter, 1976; Braunstein and Lowe, 2001; Renaut and Jones, 2011; Campbell et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2019).\nProximal apron lithofacies in the Hamamtepe site represent areas near the spring point and predominately have been classified as silica infiltrate, spring conduits (geyser mound), nodular and finely laminated geyserite (Figs. 3, 4). Similar lithofacies have been identified in the Muratlar silica sinter, where silica infiltrate, spring conduits (vent conduit, vent mount) and finely laminated geyserite ocur (Figs. 3, 4). Each feature is described below.\nSilica Infiltrate: The infiltrate lithofacies were deposits of tortuous, superheated (>100\u00a0\u00b0C), shallow subterranean hydrothermal fluid, with feeders positioned immediately beneath subaerial geyser vents, mounds and surface pools (Campbell et al., 2019). Silica infiltrate is defined as parallel, thin, irregular beds of alternating different color silica, with very thin borders of dark blue-grey, metal-rich silica, as well as swirly to globular white silica (Hamilton et al. 2019a; Campbell et al., 2019). It has been commonly observed with proximal sinter facies in the hydrothermal deposits of Atastra Creek, USA and especially of New Zealand (Oldfield, 1989; Rodgers et al., 2004; Hamilton et al., 2019b). Similar to these morphologies the lower level of the Hamamtepe site (H1 and H2 quarries) consists of thin and\/or mostly thick layered or rarely chaotic structured beds of alternating dark grey, blue-grey, grey and white silica layers. Silica layers generally have quite variable thicknesses that range from 1 to 15\u00a0cm (Fig. 3a). The silica layers in the Muratlar site were much thinner than the layers of the Hamamtepe deposits (Fig. 3b). These differences in layer thickness were most likely related to the physico-chemical properties of silica-rich hydrothermal fluid feeders. Each differently colored layer indicates a generation of fluid with unique physico-chemical properties over a certain interval of time. The chaotic silica structure was frequently observed in a swirly or a cloudy morphology (Fig. 3c,d). These chaotic silica structures were likely related to the deformation of horizontal laminas by tectonic activity or bursting of sinters (Hamilton et al., 2019). Silica infiltrate lithofacies of the EFSSR indicate that these deposits were feeders with high temperature geothermal fluids, which were located under the mounds.\nSpring Conduits: Spring conduits were defined as open, tortuous, cylindrical central holes that occurred in mounds or fissures from which high volumes and high temperature geothermal fluids waters came out to produce geysers and spouters (Braunstein and Lowe, 2001; Guido and Campbell, 2009; Guido and Campbell, 2011; Hamilton et al., 2019a) (Fig. 3e-j). Miocene vent conduit geyserite sinter; Atastra Creek, California, USA (Campbell et al., 2019) and Jurassic vent mound of geyserite with conduit; La Calandra Sur, Claudia, Deseado Massif, Argentina (Guido and Campbell, 2011) are known fossil vent conduits and show similarities to many vent conduits and mound observed in EFSSR.\nA large cylindrical geyser chimney column was identified in the H1 quarry, which is the largest silica deposit of the Hamamtepe site. This column-like feature is approximately two meters in diameter and nearly six meters in length. Cylindrical geyser is typically oriented vertically to the land surface. However, the fluid flow holes could not be found in the H1 quarry. These fluid flow hole features may have been destroyed by various physical effects, such as erosion or mining activity. Very small diameter hot fluid flow channels were identified in mounds that were nearby to the Hamamtepe site (Fig. 3h).\nSilica deposits around the Muratlar site were generally less altered or eroded than the Hamamtepe site. Structurally, geyser mounds and hot water outlet siphons were frequently well-preserved in the Muratlar silica site. The sizes of the mounds were variable in size, approximately ranging from one to four meters in diameter and from a few cm to meters in length. They were generally oriented vertically to rarely sub-vertically with respect to the land surface (Fig. 3g). The shape of the vent conduits and vent holes were quite different from each other, with many being cylindrical and some with fissures having round shape. These holes and vents were mostly located on the upper side of the silica mounds (Fig. 3e,f,i,j).\nSpring conduits indicated where the high temperature fluids flow pathways occurred. Walls of conduit holes were near to these fluid channels, where it appears that silica precipitated over time and formed mounds in different dimensions. Hamilton et al. (2019) stated that spring conduits exit to the land surface and may formed geyser mounds with central conduit areas remaining open to the rapidly cooling, superheated fluid emissions within the spring vent area. The temperatures of these silica-rich and high fluid volume discharge zones in modern systems are typically in the range of 75 \u2013 100\u00a0\u00b0C (Giggenbach et al., 1994).\nNodular Geyserite: Nodular geyserite typically formed in the slightly drier portions of vent areas that were subject to very high temperatures, but less splashing, which is characterized by small rounded, clumped nodular humps (Braunstein and Lowe, 2001; Campbell et al., 2015) (Fig. 4a, b).\nThe nodular geyserite was observed only in a limited area resembling a bowl between the two faults in the H1 quarry (Fig. 4a, b). Two types of nodules have been identified in this quarry; the first type were nodules with 2\u20135\u00a0cm diameters, which were large and rounded and highly affected by alteration (Fig. 4a). The large spheres were not in contact with each other and the gaps were cemented by iron oxide and\/or clay minerals. The second nodular texture was small rounded forms and their diameters varied between 0.5\u00a0mm and 1\u00a0cm (Fig. 4b). Unlike the large nodules, small spheres were in contact with each other and their gaps were cemented with microcrystalline quartz. Similar modern individual nodules were characterized in the outer reaches of splash zones in vent areas, or on vent rims vertically above the air\u2013water interface of the spring source hot pool (>75\u00a0\u00b0C) (see e.g., Hamilton et al., 2019a; Kyle et al., 2007).\nFinely Laminated: The stratification that occurs where fast flowing geothermal fluids debouched from the vent on the proximal slope and in upper apron outflow channels at high temperatures is defined as thin silica laminations (Guido and Campbell, 2011). Good modern examples of finely laminated sinter lithofacies are in Geyser Valley (Russia) and Taupo Volcanic Zone (New Zealand) with the appearances of finely laminated sinter in wavy sheets, forming on a proximal slope. Finely laminated sinter lithofacies in the EFSSR region were mostly deformed and lost some of their primary morphologies. These features of finely laminated sinter morphologies at EFSSR are similar to Miocene geyserites found in Gold Hill, Nevada, USA and Dalmeny site the Miocene Coromandel Volcanic Zone, New Zealand (Campbell et al., 2015; Hamilton et al., 2017).\nIn both silica sinter sites of the EFSSR, thin silica laminas with dark and light gray or white banding fine silica laminaes that were laterally continuous for tens of meters (Fig. 4c-g). The thickness of the laminae varies between 1 and 5\u00a0mm, and commonly showed small wavelets with amplitudes ranging from 2 to 3\u00a0mm and crests ranging from 3 to 5\u00a0cm. Fine silica laminations were clearly observed in the Muratlar site M6, M7 and M11 quarries (Fig. 4c-e). However, in the Hamamtepe silica site, they were detected in a very limited area in the H1 and H5 quarries (Fig. 4f, g). Fine silica lamination developed on the proximal slope adjacent to vents, may have been episodic in deposition due to changes in the volume of water discharged from the ventilation hole at high temperatures approximately 60\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C (Walter et al., 1996; Guido and Campbell, 2011; Hamilton et al., 2019).\nSinter Clast Breccia: Sinter clast breccia in modern systems were formed from physical disruptions, such as during erosion or joint\/fracture development and commonly observed in varied locations across the sinter apron, ranging from vents to distal marsh areas. Sinter brecciation can take place during syn-deposition or post-deposition. This facies may form throughout the sinter aprons but it is commonly observed in dried out mid-apron areas (Hamilton et al., 2019). When the water table drops or if the water channel changes location, then the silica mat dries out and sinter clast breccia is formed from broken silicified mats (Jones and Renaut, 2003). Browne and Lawless (2001) describe hydrothermal eruptions as \u201can eruption ejecting at least some solid material and whose energy derives solely from heat loss and phase changes in a convecting hot water or steam-dominated hydrothermal system.\u201d They are subject to periodic activities of many fumarolic ejections, which create geyserites. These eruptions occur where the lithology of surface formations are relatively impermeable consequently, geothermal fluids cannot find a fracture zone to release the overburden pressure and it occurs when the vapour pressure exceeds the hydrostatic boiling pressure for a given temperature. Hedenquist and Henley (1985) proposed two scenarios for hydrothermal eruptions based on observations from the Waiotapu geothermal field of New Zealand, including; 1) a shallow geothermal reservoir model at temperatures of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0195\u00a0\u00b0C and a depth of 200\u00a0m and 2) a deep geothermal reservoir model at temperatures of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0230\u00a0\u00b0C and a depth of 400\u00a0m. In both models, reservoirs are sealed by about a 100\u00a0m depth impermeable rock layer and, the effects of tectonic activities on the overburden sealed rocks controlled chemical alteration and the forming of geyserites and geyser mounds. During the eruption scenario for a shallower hydrothermal reservoir, the transmitted vapour pressure is slightly above the lithostatic overburden pressure, hydrodynamic flow follows fracture systems, and pressure\u2013balance eruption occurs. During the deeper hydrothermal reservoir scenario, vapour pressure must be enough to lift the overburdened rocks. It creates blastic conditions at the surface that form a crater and\/or pyroclastic surges ejecta dispersal. The shallow reservoir model is a more likely scenario for the Etili area, which is enough to carry out the maximum amount of dissolved silica from deep reservoirs.\nIn the EFSSR, especially in the H1, H3, H4 quarries of the Hamamtepe site and in the M2, M3 and M4 quarries of the Muratlar site, the brecciated structure was observed (Fig. 5a-d). The clasts in the breccia zone are irregular and angular with highly variable grains size from 1\u20132\u00a0mm to 5\u201310\u00a0cm. These clasts have combined by microgranular quartz cementation while they can be classified into two groups depending on lithology of the clasts. In the first type, clasts are composed of quartz. These type fabrics may have occurred from physical degradation such as joint\/fracture development of pre-existing silica sinter beds. Firstly, the previously deposited silica sinter is disrupted by tectonic activity, and then the silica-rich solution is injected into the joint and fractures. Finally, when the silica becomes super saturated, quartz\/opal precipitates. In the second type, breccias were formed of the bed rocks clasts (mostly tuff, andesite, etc.) by the similar physical process but bedrock clasts display considerable different colors.\n\nSilicified Volcanic Rocks: Silicified rocks were observed as large masses at the bottom levels of the deposits. It appeared that much more silicification occurred in the Hamamtepe site compared to the Muratlar site. A laterally developed silicification zone has been observed around the epithermal veins in the bedrock, which extend radially large distances (hundreds of meters). This silica form was best observed in the M1 quarry in the Muratlar site. The lateral spreading of silicified volcanic deposit thicknesses can extend tens of meters (Guido and Campbell, 2009). The silicification occurred as the Si-rich geothermal waters interacted with volcanic rocks in upflow areas along fault zones. Bedrock with high porosity and permeability were commonly observed around the study area (i.e., tuffs, andesites, and volcano-clastics) and therefore they were easily silicified in the shallow levels of geothermal fields (Henneberger and Browne, 1988; Rowland and Simmons, 2012) (Fig. 7i,j). Silicification takes place through thermal fluid infiltration in phreatic zones of a pre-existing deposits in geothermal fields including primarily condensation and remobilization of silica. Secondly, blankets of opal had inverted to chalcedony over time below the vadose zone and finally, and in time, chalcedony inverts to quartz with larger crystallite domains (Sillitoe, 1993; 2015; Hedenquist et al., 2000). The volume change associated with the opal-CT to quartz transformation may impart additional stresses on the rocks and cause fracturing.\n\nEpithermal Veins: Epithermal veins that are late-staged products of hydrothermal alteration and are an important indicator for gold mineralization and were clearly observed in the M1 kaolin quarry of the Muratlar site (Fig. 5e,f). The thickness of the veins varies between 5 and 30\u00a0cm and these veins cross-cut pre-existing lithologies (such as; host rocks, altered zones and silicified rocks). These brownish or almost black in colour veins were rich in quartz as well as sulfur and iron-containing minerals that derived from disseminated pyrite oxidation (Fig. 5f). These silica-rich veins were formed by filling the gaps veins and conduits in the bedrocks of near-neutral pH alkaline chloride fluids, which are common products in epithermal systems (Lindgren, 1933; Simon et al., 2005). These aqueous fluids were likely the product of the interaction of groundwater and magmatic water at extremely high temperatures (200\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C) (Heald et al., 1987).\n\n\n4.3\nMicrobial preservation\nWe postulate that biological entities were once present in these epithermal systems however, most visible biological traces have disappeared because of erosion and diagenesis that have occurred over time. Nevertheless, FE-SEM investigations revealed four putative microbiota forms that were detected in the EFSSR. These include; retiforms, spherical cells, hyphae, and diatom frustules (Fig. 6a, Fig. 6b). These forms have been observed in modern hot springs from Kamchatka, Russia and Yellowstone, USA (Kyle and Schroeder, 2007; Kyle et al., 2007). Ancient sinters from extinct hot springs may retain some of these primary textural characteristics (Rice et al., 1995; Walter et al., 1996; Trewin et al., 2003; Campbell et al., 2003; Lynne and Campbell, 2004), however their palaeoenvironmental signatures are commonly obscured by the loss of fine-scale microstructure due to diagenetic overprinting (Cady and Farmer, 1996) or differential preservation (Guidry and Chafetz, 2003).\nThermophilic microbiota can colonize in silica sinters and the taxonomic identities of these microbes may vary within and between different geothermal settings (Inagaki et al., 2001; Blank et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2005; Schinteie et al., 2007; Pancost et al., 2006; Des Marais and Walter, 2019). In particular, sinter deposits and their microbiota may act as indicators of pH-temperature conditions (Brock, 1978; Cassie and Cooper, 1989; Cady and Farmer, 1996; Lowe et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2000; Jones and Renaut, 2003; Lynne and Campbell, 2003, Rodgers et al., 2004) and the hydrodynamics of spring discharge (Jones and Renaut, 1997; Braunstein and Lowe, 2001; Lowe et al., 2001; Guidry and Chafetz, 2003; Lowe and Braunstein, 2003; Des Marais and Walter, 2019, Konhauser and Lalonde, 2010).\nThe FE-SEM analysis of the EFSSR samples showed retiform structures, which were observed as rods, knotty and several forms of long thin filaments attached to webs (Fig. 6a-g). Retiform fabrics resembled a mat community that exist on surfaces of the sinters mostly consisting of active mat communities and non-porous opaline silica, which were separated by shallow depressions. At temperatures of 60\u201373\u00a0\u00b0C thin yellow-to-orange mats would be dominated by the cyano-bacterium. Synechococcus and photosynthetic bacterium Chloroflexus covering the sinter surfaces of pond floors and outflow (Cady and Farmer, 1996). These microorganisms along ridge margins undergo various degrees of silicification by encrustation. Although, the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar sites have lost their pre-morphological features, FE-SEM images suggest the presence of a mat community that lived at high temperatures sinter surfaces and pond floors of these deposits (Fig. 6a, Fig. 6b). Also observed in the EFSSR were spherical cells or leptospheres, which are mostly 4\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter and these have very clean, polished-like surfaces (Fig. 6b, j). Spherical cells may be vestiges of algae, belonging to the green mats that cover the sinter rims on the margins of the deposits (Schinteie et al., 2007; Kyle et al., 2007). This suggests a pre-existing mat community in the EFSSR environment, such as those seen in the reticulated fabrics in the spherical cells. Hollow silicified hyphae are a minor but nearly ubiquitous constituent of the EFSSR samples (Fig. 6a, h, Fig. 6b, i). The diameters of the tubes in the studied samples ranged from 0.5 \u2212 1\u00a0\u03bcm that were linked to each other (Fig. 6a h, Fig. 6b i). Hyphae can generally be defined as silica tube that formed around the microbes.\nCyanobacteria and\/or fungi may have produced these borings based on their small diameter (up to 2\u00a0\u03bcm) and limited penetration depth (Jones and Renaut, 2003: Kyle et al., 2007). Being intertwined with other microstructures indicates that these hyphae structures may have been developed by fungi and cyanobacteria in silica sinter pools with mats. Diatoms with diameters of 1 to 2\u00a0mm were detected in the hand samples of the M5 deposit (Fig. 6b, k-p). These fossils have been observed in large numbers in a very limited area on the surface of rocks around the water outlet channel. The frustules of these microfossils were covered with euhedral quartz (Fig. 6b, k,l). The morphological structure of another diatom frustule detected among retiform forms in the same sample of the M5 was clearly observed, however a taxonomic identification was not made (Fig. 6b, n-o). Diatoms are eukaryotic unicellular algae that have opal-A frustules, which can live in both acidic or alkaline environments above\u00a0\u223c\u00a070\u00a0\u00b0C (Smol et al., 1986; Beauger et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2019).\n\n\n4.4\nDistinguishing the alkali chloride and acid-sulfate fluids\n\n4.4.1\nDistinguishing by mineralogical properties\nDetailed assessment of quartz in the EFSSR helps to obtain more detailed evidence for past alkali-chloride solutions and understanding of the evolution of geothermal fluids. Thin section studies, XRD, and FE-SEM analysis indicate they are composed predominantly of alpha-quartz (Fig. 3,4) with no evidence for other silica polymorphs. Metastable silica transitions through a sequence of polymorphs from opal-A, opal-CT to quartz, resulting in massive, thick, highly silicified rocks, where groundwater infiltrates after the discharging of alkali chloride liquids (Fournier and Rowe, 1966; Herdianita et al., 2000; Okamoto et al., 2010; Rodgers et al., 2004; White et al., 1988;). The precipitation rates occur over several hundreds of years in sinter deposits to produce considerable amounts of para-crystalline opal-CT and\/or opal-C, whereas micro-crystalline quartz sinter deposits take>20,000\u00a0years to form (White et al., 1964; White et al., 1988). Falling and rising water tables cause desiccation, erosion, or in-filling of the venting points, which can form a siliceous blanket up to 25\u00a0m or more in thickness over time. In this context, the rapid cooling of a boiling fluid as it ascends near the surface results in silica deposition, either as well-formed quartz (at\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b0C) or as chalcedony at<150\u00b0 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C or amorphous silica at 100\u00b0 to 150\u00a0\u00b0C (Hedenquist et al., 2000). Chalcedony being quartz with occasional moganite (Heaney and Jeffrey, 1992), is comprised of submicroscopic crystals with parallel grown domains of quartz with a radially fiber appearance in thin-section.\nThe presence of silica sinter implies that the alkali chloride waters from which it was originated in shallow reservoirs whose temperatures were hotter than 175\u00a0\u00b0C (Fournier and Rowe, 1966). In high-temperature reservoirs, pH of the geothermal water increases from 6 to 9 on average during the CO2 degassing and approximately 36% of the total SiO2 precipitates (Guo et al., 2017). Rimstadt and Cole (1983) described three steps in the formation of siliceous sinter: (1) Quartz-saturated hydrothermal fluids in the reservoir rise to the surface where they cool and become supersaturated with amorphous silica; (2) Amorphous silica particles nucleate to produce a colloidal suspension; and (3) Amorphous silica particles are agglomerated and cemented as amorphous silica precipitates between particles. While the first of the three steps suggested by Rimstadt and Cole (1983) is compatible with the formation of silica sinters in the EFSSR, the third is most compatible with the silicification textures observed in EFSSR. Model formation temperatures calculated from oxygen isotopes of the EFSSR siliceous and silicified rocks suggest a maximum of 140\u00a0\u00b0C. The EFSSR silica likely precipitated from a high-temperature alkaline solution containing high silica as chalcedony or amorphous silica, which subsequently transformed into quartz with time since the Miocene.\nThe anhedral (<0.5 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm) and euhedral quartz (5 to 60\u00a0\u03bcm) crystals mostly coexisting together were commonly observed in the EFSSR (Fig. 7c,d; Fig. 8b,f,g). These dimensional and morphological differences indicates that they formed under different paleoenvironmental conditions. Three different phases have been defined using FE-SEM textural data and XRD data in the EFSSR samples (Fig. 8). These include i) infilled primary porosity with secondary quartz, ii) cross-cutting earlier formed textures, and iii) replacement of the phenocyrstalline quartz to microcrystalline quartz. In the first phase, euhedral quartz crystals up to 60\u00a0\u03bcm in length infill voids of primary porosity within the siliceous and silicified rocks (Fig. 7b,c,f). Post-depositional euhedral quartz is a common infill of primary porosity, which occurred after the chalcedonic infilling event in some voids (Fig. 7d). The second phase involves the development of quartz micro veins, where these micro veins are comprised of well-formed crystals 1 to 10\u00a0\u00b5m in size (Fig. 7e). These quartz veins crosscut the rocks by the fractures and structural weaknesses and rarely link voids of primary porosity in the siliceous and silicified rocks. The third phase is thought to represent phenocyrstalline quartz that were relicts of the silicified tuffs and syn-depositional microcrystalline quartz that were further replaced by anhedral micro-quartz during silicification (Fig. 7g; Fig. 8e).\nThese morphological and petrographic descriptions indicate the presence of very intense and continuous silicification, especially in the basement rocks (tuff and andesite), during the post-deposition and syn-deposition. Silicious and silicified rocks are spread over a very wide area and almost the entire area is covered with silica mounds. Development of this silica cap was steam-heated blankets of alteration, although a friable and silica-rich opaline cap of residual material may form locally (Hedenquist et al., 2000). Steam-heated water collected at the water table and created aquifer-controlled stratiform blankets of dense silicification, typically chalcedony (Schoen et al., 1974; Hedenquist et al., 2000), up to several kilometers away from the zone of generation of steam-heated water (Sillitoe, 1993).\nAltered zones of the Hamamtepe site consist of quartz\u00a0+\u00a0kaolinite\u00a0+\u00a0halloysite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0alunite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0jarosite in order of abundance. However, the Muratlar site consisted of higher abundances of quartz and kaolinite and lower amounts of alunite and halloysite that can be explained by less concentrated acid sulphate solutions. Ascending sulfur-rich geothermal fluids oxidize to form H2SO4, which lowers the pH of geothermal waters, thus creating advanced argillic alteration in fossil geothermal fields. At lower temperatures (<180\u00a0\u00b0C), the basic minerals related to acid-sulphate geothermal fluids are kaolinite, alunite, cristobalite, gypsum, opal, native S, quartz, and Fe-sulphides commonly associated with advanced argillic alteration assemblage. This group of minerals typically occurred under highly acidic (pH 2\u20134) environments and typically surrounding silicic cores in a high-sulfidation environment (Berger and Henley, 1989; Pirajno, 1995; Pirajno, 2012; Hedenquist et al., 2000; Dill et al., 2005; Simon et al., 2005; Ece et al., 2008). Model formation temperature calculated from the oxygen isotopes of kaolinite in EFSSR ranged from 49 to 84\u00a0\u00b0C, consistent with the idea that lower temperatures and solutions were related to acid-sulphate alteration.\nAbove the groundwater table, kaolinite and alunite are low-temperature acid-stable minerals. When the pH of steam-heated acid-sulfate water is 2 to 3 with generally low-sulfate concentrations, then HCl can be an added source of acidity (Schoen et al., 1974; Sillitoe, 1993). This type fluid readily hydrolyzes volcanic glass and minerals, and as Al tends to remain insoluble at pH above 2, it is fixed in kaolinite and alunite. Alunite-group minerals are also known to be associated with kaolinite group minerals such as halloysite that form in various acid-sulfate environments (Rye et al., 1992). Alunite associated with halloysite has been reported in Lechuguilla Cave in the Guadalupe Mountains (Palmer and Palmer, 1992). Alunite can be found in four distinct settings known as supergene, steam-heated, magmatic-hydrothermal, and magmatic steam environments (Rye et al., 1992). In contrast, jarosite has only been found in steam-heated and supergene environments (Rye and Alpers, 1997); jarosite also occurs in the \u201csour gas\u201d environment, in which sulfate originates by oxidation of H2S as seen, in the Rio Grande rift in New Mexico and Chihuahua, Mexico (Lueth et al., 2000). The jarosite in the Hamamtepe site indicates steam-heated and supergene environments (Fig. 9).\nRandomly oriented kaolinite crystals detected in the Muratlar site samples usually indicate disordered forms at low temperatures (Bailey, 1993). However, vermiform booklet platelets found as equally sized crystals between 0.5 and 2.0\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig. 9a, b) detected at the Hamamtepe site indicate high-temperature epithermal systems (Sillitoe, 1993). Halloysite crystal size and morphology were not the same in the study sites, where tubular dimensions were variable in their length, yet consistent in their diameters. Bailey (1993) noted that changes in the morphology and dimensions of the hydrated halloysite can be related to the chemical composition of the tubes; for instance, long tubes favor an A12O3 content of 46 to 50 % (Al-rich) and a Fe2O3 content of\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0wt%. The transformation of halloysite to kaolinite was seen by the occurrence of curved kaolinite flakes, resulting in incipient thin-layered crystals being stressed in part by the misfit between octahedral and octahedral tetrahedral sheets resulting in curling strain (Ece et al., 2013). Pseudo-hexagonal alunite crystals varying from 200 to 500\u00a0\u00b5m formed under the influence of intense feldspar dissolution at a pH of 2 and an oxygen fugacity slightly above the thermodynamic boundary between the H2S and bisulfate fields (Ece and Schroeder, 2007). The Hamamtepe samples showed excellent examples of alunite transforming halloysite tubular structures and these growing halloysite tubes were mostly observed at the edge of pseudo-hexagonal particles of alunite. The occurrence of pseudo-hexagonal alunite crystals and the subsequent forming of halloysite tubes is a function of the difference in water pH and the porosity and permeability of the parent rocks (Ercan et al., 1995).\n\n\n4.4.2\nDistinguishing by geochemical data\nSiliceous and silicified rock samples contain very high SiO2 and the concentrations of other major oxides was very low (Table 2). Generally, the trace element content of these samples were very low, possibly because these silica deposits were the end member product of hydrothermal systems. Trace element negative anomalies in sinter deposits are typical of the epithermal systems (Sillitoe, 2015) and are the last member of low-sulfidation within the epithermal environment, thus indicating that they were also formed at near-neutral pH (Hedenquist et al., 2000). Silica contents of silicified samples were quite high (>97 % SiO2) except for one sample of the Muratlar silica deposits (93 % SiO2). When the silica concentrations were considered according to the epithermal classification of Hedenquist et al. (2000), samples reflect the characteristics of residual silica (>95 % SiO2) within steam-heated environment. SiO2 content of siliceous and silicified rocks in the EFSSR was generally above 95 %. In this study, high SiO2 content was interpreted as re-dissolution and re-precipitation of quartz or opals. Siliceous and silicified deposits samples reflect a shallow portion of the system (depths\u00a0<\u00a0150\u00a0m) included in the low sulfidation process of epithermal systems with low base metal contents affecting by cooling water (Sillitoe et al., 1996; Hedenquist et al., 2000).\nThe EFSSR sinters and associated epithermal deposits do not yield detectable gold (Table 2). Enrichment of the ore in precious metal concentrations is related to the amount of magmatic input that enriches fluids (Simmons et al., 2015). Hedenquist et al. (2000) defined these environments that have shallow depths (<300\u00a0m), 1% NaCl content, gas-rich, fluids with a temperature of\u00a0<\u00a0220\u00a0\u00b0C as low-sulfidation environments. Low base metal contents of silica-rich samples clearly indicate subsurface or surface fluids rich in NaCl at a temperature of\u00a0<\u00a0220\u00a0\u00b0C, with low sulfidation environments. This is also supported by \u03b418O and \u03b4D stable isotopic values which suggests meteoric waters are the primary reacting fluids. In the H2 quarry, the concentration of approximately 1\u00a0ppm Au in kaolins suggests that they may have a base metal potential for the associated epithermal ore deposition at depth.\nHg contents range from 0.01 to 0.61\u00a0ppm in kaolins and from 0.01 to 0.46\u00a0ppm in siliceous and silicified rocks. Hg content of the Hamamtepe samples was slightly higher than in the Muratlar samples. In general, the transportation of Hg was assumed to be as a vapor phase (Barnes and Seward, 1997), as all samples have low mercury content. Barnes and Seward (1997) indicated that Hg was possibly a dominant species at lower temperatures in steam-heated environments. When Ba and Sr concentrations of the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar tuff samples are compared with altered siliceous and silicified samples, there is an enrichment in altered samples. Large ion lithophile elements such as (LILE) Ba, Sr, Rb and K were likely sourced from K-feldspars, which undergo hydrolysis in the initially undersaturated geothermal solutions, thus the signature of LILE elements is carried as a high Ba\u00a0+\u00a0Sr concentration in altered samples. An enrichment was also seen in the high-field-strength elements (HFSE) content of the Hamamtepe site. The HFSE elements such as Ti, Zr, Nb, La, and Y, are relatively immobile during hypogene alteration and behave with insolublity, thus not transported far by water (Dill et al., 1997). This suggests the Hamamtepe site formed hypogenic alteration products. The Ba\u00a0+\u00a0Sr concentration of siliceous and silicified samples varied between 4 and 2000\u00a0ppm in both silica sites and these values were lower than the altered samples. The Ce\u00a0+\u00a0Y\u00a0+\u00a0La content of the siliceous and silicified samples were lower (<13\u00a0ppm) than the altered samples (Fig. 10\n). Using the classification scheme of Dill et al. (1997), the majority of altered samples fall into the hypogene area and the silica-rich samples fall into the mixed type area (Fig. 10). Ba and Sr elements are relatively soluble in water, thus very sensitive to alteration and silicification processes. That effect was clearly observed in the silica-rich samples in Fig. 10. Distinguishing hypogene and mixed type effects can be further understood using a Zr versus TiO2 binary diagram (MacLean and Barrett, 1993). Fig. 10 shows these values for the siliceous and silicified samples and altered samples from the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar silica sites, which fall mostly into the mixed type area, whereas a few siliceous and silicified samples fall into the hypogene area. The plot in Fig. 10 supports the hypothesis that siliceous and silicified samples and altered samples of the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar silica sites were formed under the influence of supergene and hypogene solutions. Altered samples were more affected by hypogenic solutions to a greater extent at the Hamamtepe site.\n\n\n4.4.3\nDistinguishing by stable isotope geochemistry and geochronology\nThe \u03b434S isotopic results of the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar sites are quite different from each other. The \u03b434S content of the alunite of the Muratlar deposit has the distinct signature of being enriched and reaching very high positive values. The \u03b434S was consumed in the alunite of the Hamamtepe deposits with a trend of \u03b434S isotopic content decreased to negative values. This points out different origins. The \u03b434S isotopic values ranged from \u22122.7 \u2030 to \u22123.3 \u2030 in the Hamamtepe H1 quarry alunite samples and reflect formation from a magmatic- hydrothermal derived sulfur source (\u22123 \/ +3 %; Rye et al., 1992). The \u03b434S \u221219.6 \u2030 value from H2 quarry indicates that reduced sulfur produced by a microbial reducing environment (Cunningham et al., 1984; Cunningham et al., 2005) or sedimentary source for sulfur. The sulfide oxidation processes produce species that are enriched in \u03b434S relative to the starting material, whereas reduction produces species that are depleted in \u03b434S (Seal et al., 2000). Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active only in anoxic environments such as below the sediment\u2013water interface and in anoxic water bodies. Various species of sulfate-reducing bacteria can survive over a range of temperature (0 to 110\u00a0\u00b0C) and pH (5 to 9.5) conditions (Postgate, 1984). More likely that organic input came from the lacustrine origin coal deposits in the west of town of \u00c7an, northeast of the Hamamtepe by the groundwater mixing with geothermal waters. This biological input was likely not homogeneously distributed and therefore may have affected small areas. A putitive bacterial population was detected in FE-SEM images of the H2 quarry samples. Although the H1 and H2 quarries are very close to each other, the \u03b434S isotopic values are quite different from each other and indicate different origins. The 40Ar\/39Ar dating made from the alunite samples belonging to these quarries were also quite distinctively different. The age data of the H2 quarry (5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 to 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma) are younger than the age data from the H1 quarry (12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 to 15.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma). These data revealed that the geothermal activities continued for a 5 to 10\u00a0Ma window with variable spatial and temporal evolutions in their origin. The sulfur isotopic values of the M1 and M5 quarries in the Muratlar site are enriched with \u03b434S (9.2 to 16.8 \u2030). During pyrite precipitation by bacterial reduction of sulfate \u03b434S is enriched in the sulfide, which will cause enrichment of the \u03b434S in the residual sulfate-rich solution. (Seal et al., 2000). As a result, recrystallized sulfate minerals are enriched in \u03b434S. The values of the 40Ar\/39Ar dating (28.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 to 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0Ma) of the alunite minerals in the M1 quarry are considerably older than the values obtained from the Hamamtepe quarry. These data collectively reveal that the geothermal activity occurring in the Muratlar site was effective long before the Hamamtepe silica site.\nA plot of \u03b418O versus \u03b4D values of kaolinite samples from the EFSSR (Fig. 11\n) showed a cluster for the Hamamtepe site indicate a grouping near the predicted magmatic water. However, kaolinite \u03b418O versus \u03b4D values of the Muratlar site plot very close supergene\/hypogene (S\/H) line of Sheppard and Gilg (1996) (Fig. 11). The left side of the S\/H line indicates a hypogene origin, whereas the right-hand side indicates a supergene environment (Fig. 11). Almost all the kaolinite \u03b418O and \u03b4D isotopic values from the EFSSR indicate hypogenic origin. One Hamamtepe samples plots into the magmatic water area. Three Hamamtepe samples and one sample of the Muratlar site were very close to the Magmatic water area (Fig. 11). These isotopic values of kaolinites indicate that they were formed from a magmatic-water dominated the early stage of acid-sulfate alteration according to Seal et al. (2000). The H1, H2 and M1 hydrothermal kaolin quarries were further evolved by interactions with meteoric water during a post-mineralization period. Isotopic re-equilibrium reflects a lower temperature resulting in kaolinite being slightly enriched in \u03b418O and highly enriched in \u03b4D (Garvelmann et al., 2012). The formation temperatures of kaolinites in the EFSSR deposits were calculated by using the isotopic fractionation factor equation of Sheppard and Gilg (1996) and was determined to be 63\u00b0 to 64\u00a0\u00b0C for the Hamamtepe site and 46\u00b0 to 58\u00a0\u00b0C for the Muratlar site (assuming meteoric water was \u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128\u2030 during deposition; this value is taken from Baba and Gunduz (2010)).\nThe \u03b418O of the samples of the siliceous and silicified deposits in the Hamamtepe site varied between 11.4 \u2030 and 18.4 \u2030, while the Muratlar samples had slightly more depleted values, between 8.3 \u2030 and 16.6 \u2030. The calculated \u03b418O values of the geothermal water that was responsible for depositing the silica sinter are 8.0 \u2030 to 22.1 \u2030; with most \u03b418O values higher than the 10 \u2030 (Hayashi, 2013). These isotopic values are compatible with other silica sinter isotopic values, where there is an enrichment in \u03b418O values due to water\/rock interaction. The formation temperatures of quartz of the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar silica sites were calculated by using the isotopic fraction factor equation of Clayton et al. (1972) and determined to range from 63\u00a0\u00b0C to 104\u00a0\u00b0C for the Hamamtepe siliceous and silicified rocks and 74\u00a0\u00b0C to 129\u00a0\u00b0C (except one sample M1 calculated to 140\u00a0\u00b0C) for the Muratlar siliceous and silicified samples.\n\n\n\n4.5\nHydrothermal evaluation of the EFSSR\nDuring the Oligocene, the metaluminous granitoidic Evciler was intruded into the volcanic association in the Biga peninsula. The Oligocene-Middle Miocene \u00c7an volcanics contain subaerial basaltic to acidic lavas and related ignimbrite, pyroclastics, and tuffs with intercalations of lacustrine deposits. The \u00c7an volcanics were the most affected rock units by hydrothermal alteration resulted from the long-lasted reactivation of magmatism from Oligocene to Pliocene. Both the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar sites developed within the thick andesitic lavas and pyroclastic units of the \u00c7an volcanics. These sites aligned with NE-SW and WNW-ESE trending faults of which zones of the alteration were developed along the main \u00c7an-Etili Fault Zone.\nThe temporal stages of hydrothermal alteration in the EFSSR can be organized in the following order of events: i) Early hydrothermal activity of the Muratlar region, ii) Intermediate hydrothermal activity in north of the Hamamtepe region, and iii) Late hydrothermal activity in south of the Hamamtepe region.\nFirst stages hydrothermal activity developed approximately together with the intrusion of the Evciler pluton at the Oligocene\/Early Miocene, which was located to the west of the study area (Muratlar site). The \u00c7an volcanics were altered to kaolinite, halloysite, and alunite, which created the advanced argillic high-sulfidization alteration assemblage in the steam-heated environment on the vadose zone. These processes, typically occur under low-pH conditions of 2 to 3 and high-sulfate concentrations, with deep ascending geothermal fluids. Above the groundwater table, kaolinite and alunite minerals were fixed by ascending acidic fluids were readily dissolved volcanic glass and mainly feldspars. At this stage, acid-sulfate geothermal waters differentiated into neutral-alkali chloride geothermal waters and became more enriched in silica. The chemical composition and pH of geothermal waters changed through time. Acid neutralization and alkalization processes caused silicification in shallow subsurface rocks by filling the gaps and fractures, while the silica-rich solutions caused the formation of silica sinters at points where geothermal waters came to the surface at upward flowing geyser where hot springs emerged at the surface (Fig. 12\n). Petrographic and isotopic data suggest bacteria were present, which are known to survive under hot and extreme conditions around hot springs.\nThe hydrothermal activities in the Hamamtepe site were developed in two different episodes, which took place after the intrusion of the Evciler pluton. In the first episode, during the intermediate silica sinter stage of the Hamamtepe, hydrothermal activity occurred during the Middle Miocene in the northern part of the Hamamtepe silica site. In the second episode, the hydrothermal activities of the late-stage silica sinters of the Hamamtepe to the south occurred during the Upper Miocene. In the Muratlar site, much before alkaline geothermal waters became active, acidic solutions at high temperatures caused shallow hydrothermal alteration of the bed rock, and the formation of kaolinite, halloysite, and alunite (M1 kaolin quarry). Jarosite was observed in Hamamtepe and not the Muratlar site. A jarosite-bearing facies suggests a low pH, sour gas steam-heated environment in supergene environments. Over time, the acidity decreased as a result of the water\u2013rock interaction. Silica derived from other rock-forming silicates deep in the system, especially from the feldspar group, dissolved in acidic conditions and the resulting orthosilicic acid was transported along with geothermal waters. These acidic solutions become more alkali-chloride with the reaction of basement rocks at shallow depth due to consumption of H+ ions and mixing with groundwater that caused precipitation of silica in shallow subsurface conditions along fracture zones near-\/surface conditions (Fig. 12). The presence of microfossils in these silica sites also supports the existence of bacteria living in an extreme environment in mats of the proximal apron.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\n\n\n\n\u2022\nProximal apron lithofacies with characteristic morphologies of silica sinters have been identified in the EFSSR. The presence of the proximal apron was supported by microfossils findings.\n\n\n\u2022\nMineralogical assemblages indicated the existence of two different geothermal fluids in the Etili fossil epithermal region that begin with an early-stage acid-sulfate fluids: low pH fluid is caused to alter minerals association, such as; kaolinite, halloysite, jarosite and alunite. Evolution of the system ends with late-stage alkali chloride fluids responsible for the precipitation of silica in the region (Fig. 12).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe relationship between with Ce\u00a0+\u00a0Y\u00a0+\u00a0La and Ba\u00a0+\u00a0Sr and the relationship with TiO2 and Zr suggests two different types for epithermal deposits of the EFSSR. The first is a hypogenic origin for kaolin samples and the second is a mixed origin (supergene and hypogene) for siliceous and silicified samples. These hypogene and supergene type formation environments were supported by \u03b418O and \u03b4D isotopic composition of kaolinites. The \u03b434S isotopic results of the Hamamtepe and the Muratlar silica sites further support several different origins\/periods of alteration. These periods show evidence of both magmatic- hydrothermal derived sulfur source and a depletion effect of bacterial activity.\n\n\n\u2022\nHydrothermal alteration assemblages indicate three distinct periods of hydrothermal activities took place in different times and places in the vicinity in the EFSSR. The alteration events indicated by 40Ar\/39Ar dating were grouped into three periods of time including: a) Early stage in the Muratlar Site (Oligocene\/Early Miocene), b) Intermediate stage in the Hamamtepe Site (Middle-Miocene) in the north of the Hamamtepe, and c) Late stage in the Hamamtepe Site (Late-Miocene) in the south of the Hamamtepe (Fig. 12).\n\n\n\n\n","46":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFluorite, commercially known as fluorspar, has recently attracted wide attention as a critical mineral listed by various counties or organizations such as the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and China (Fang et al., 2020; Yi et al., 2021). China is a worldwide leader both in the production and reserves of fluorite resources (USGS, 2021,). The fluorite deposits in China are mainly characterized by epigenetic vein-type mineralization (Han et al., 2020; Pei, 2018; Zhang et al., 2014). These fluorite vein systems which typically fill shear zones, tension fractures and tectonic breccias have contributed the main source of fluorine worldwide (Wang et al., 2014; Zappettini et al., 2017).\nThe Great Xing\u2019an Range (GXR, also referred to as the Great Hingan Range or Da Hinggan) is a NE\u2013SW-trending tectonic domain located in the western part of Northeast China (Fig. 1\na). With the reputation for abundant Cu-Fe-Sn-Mo-REE-Pb-Zn-Ag-polymetallic mineral deposits (Fig. 1b) (Feng et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2015; Pirajno and Zhou, 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2011; Zhai et al., 2020), the GXR also contains significant amounts of fluorite deposits (Fig. 1; Han et al., 2020; Pei, 2018; Zou et al., 2019). Previous research in the GXR mostly focused on the metallic deposits, while the non-metallic (fluorite and others) deposits have received much less attention (Zou et al., 2019).\nRecently, prospecting work of the Linxi area in eastern Inner Mongolia has achieved a great breakthrough, and more than 60 fluorite deposits (e.g., Shuitou, Baoshan, and Xiaobeigou) or occurrences have been identified and partially mined, thus making this district as a dominant fluorite producing area (Pei et al., 2016). However, some key aspects related to formation age, nature of ore fluids, and ore-forming processes in Linxi ore cluster remain unclear. In this contribution, we conduct a systematical investigation on geology, geochronology, the microthermometry of fluid inclusions, trace element and stable isotope (C\u2013H-O) geochemistry, based on experimental results and previous works (e.g., Pei et al., 2017; Pei et al., 2019), with the aim of documenting the nature and ore-forming mechanisms of the fluorite veins in the whole Linxi district.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Linxi fluorite district tectonically belongs to the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB; Fig. 1a), which is bounded by the Siberia Craton to the north and by the North China Craton to the south (Jahn et al., 2000). The CAOB represents one of the world\u2019s largest sites of juvenile crustal growth in the Phanerozoic era and is intimately related to the opening, subduction and closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (Jian et al., 2010; Seng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Xiao et al., 2003). There is growing consensus that the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean occurred along the Solonker Suture Zone during the Late Permian\u2013Early Triassic era (Eizenh\u00f6fer et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2018; Wilde, 2015; Windley et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2015). Subsequently, intercontinental development of the southern part of the CAOB is largely affected by tectonic superposition by the Mongolia\u2013Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific oceanic subduction systems (Kimura et al., 1990; Li et al., 2018; Pirajno and Zhou, 2015; Sorokin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2015b; Zhai and Santosh, 2013). Under the above tectonic regime, tectonic framework is characterized by sets of roughly EW-trending faults that are cut by NE\u2013trending faults. These fault systems, combined with a series of subsidiary faults and fractures (e.g, NW-trending faults), control the spatial distribution of outcropping strata, magmatic rocks and mineral deposits.\nLithologically, the southern GXR contains remnants of Precambrian medium- to high-grade metamorphic basements which is composed mainly of, blueschists, mica schists, ophiolites, plagioclase gneisses, granites, quartzites, and volcanic rocks (Wang et al., 2015c; Zhang et al., 2017). These metamorphic complexes are unconformably overlain by the Paleozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences and voluminous Mesozoic volcanic lava and pyroclastic rocks (Dong et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2018).\nIntrusive and volcanic rocks are extensively distributed along the major faults within the GXR during Late Paleozoic to Mesozoic and form part of a NE\u2013SW-trending magmatic belt throughout NE China (Pang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020; Shao et al., 1999), with the majority emplaced in three major phases: 290\u2013270\u00a0Ma, 260\u2013220\u00a0Ma and 155\u2013120\u00a0Ma (Ouyang et al., 2015; Pei et al., 2018). The southern GXR contains a series of economically significant polymetallic (Mo, Cu, Sn, Fe, Au, Pb, Zn, Ag, etc.) and nonmetallic (fluorite, graphite, etc.) resources. Diverse genetic types of ore deposits, mainly including porphyry, skarn and epithermal vein-type, have been recognized in this region since 1970 (Ouyang et al., 2015; Song et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nGeology of fluorite deposits in the Linxi district\nThe Linxi district is situated ca. 200\u00a0km northwest of Chifeng City, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Up to now, a total of 67 fluorite deposits or occurrences have been discovered in the Linxi fluorite field, of which middle-large scale deposits such as Shuitou, Sandaoyingzi, Xiaobeigou, Baoshan and Madaigou are mainly distributed in the central and western parts of the region (Fig. 2\n).\n\n3.1\nWall rocks\nFluorite and\/or silica veins can form in a range of host lithologies. From this perspective, there is no selectivity for fluorite mineralization to host rocks. The main ore-hosting units in the mining area include the Permian sedimentary rocks, Mesozoic volcano-sedimentary assemblages as well as intrusive rocks (Fig. 2). The Permian strata are well exposed and mainly composed of slate, siltstone, and sandstone, which are part of three lithologic units: the Shoushangou Formation (P1\nss), Dashizhai Famation (P1\nds) and Linxi Formation (P3\nl). Permian sedimentary rocks act as the main host to the polymetallic and fluorite deposits in the GXR (Pei, 2018; Song et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2015). Volcano-sedimentary successions crop out in the north and south-central area and mainly formed in the Late Mesozoic (Zhang et al., 2010). They are dominated by crystalline tuff, rhyolite and volcanic breccia and unconformably overlie the Permian slates. Late Paleozoic to Late Mesozoic granitoids are also the important ore-hosting rocks, including granite, quartz porphyry and granodiorite, which mainly outcrop in the north-central area.\n\n\n3.2\nStructure\nFault systems are well developed in the Linxi district. The fault zone is characterized by containing a high density of steeply dipping fractures that cut across the volcano-sedimentary sequences and also extend into the granitoids. According to our field investigations, five major sets of fractures oriented \u223cN-S, NNE-SSW, NE-SW, E-W and NW-SE could be distinguished (Fig. 3\na-b). (1) Fault zone with \u223cN-S orientation extending up to 3\u00a0km and 6\u00a0m wide is mainly filled by quartz, fluorite and minor sulfide (Fig. 3c), which is mainly developed in Xiaobeigou and locally connected with the NNE-SSW structure; (2) NNE-SSW-striking faults act as the main ore-controlling structures and exhibit sinistral strike-slip (Fig. 3d) with fluorite mineralization often occurring on the fault plane even near the surface (Fig. 3d); (3) Steeply dipping NE-SW fractures are well developed in the region and controlled the distribution of magmatic rocks and hydrothermal veins; (4) The mineralized fractures that oriented nearly E-W generally extend over limited distances with transtensional strike-slip and are mainly distributed in Baoshan, which show low average fluorite grade; and (5) Fractures with NW-SE and\/or other orientation with only quartz filling are generally small in scale and intersect the main faults with \u223cN-S to NE-SW orientation, which may have been influential in the localization of ore bodies.\nMost of the fractures, particularly those in \u223cS-N-, NNE-SSW- and NE-SW-striking fault zones, formed the sites of deposition of quartz-fluorite veins. It is worth noting that the NNE-SSW- to NE-SW-striking faults also played a significant role in controlling polymetallic mineralization within the southern GXR even all over the whole Eastern China (Ouyang et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2017). The mechanical properties and deformation characteristics of ore-controlling faults play an important role in controlling the occurrence, spatial distribution, ore fabrics of orebodies, as well as orebody scale and ore grade (Fig. 3c-g). The relative motion of two plates forms a series of irregular lenticular pull-off and stripping spaces that are distributed with an echelon pattern, which acted as conduits for the migration, filling and agglomeration of ore-forming fluids. Thus, orebodies hosted by these fault zones are characterized by irregular lenticular or lens (lentil) in shape both in lateral and vertical distributions (Fig. 3h).\n\n\n3.3\nVein mineralogy and paragenesis\nField investigations reveal that the nature of vein-type fluorite deposits in the Linxi district are similar and relatable. Accordingly, here we consider the fluorite deposits in the Linxi district as a whole. Fluorite often occurs as sets of ribbon veins emplaced in steep fractures. Take the largest Shuitou fluorite deposit as an example, fluorite-bearing veins discontinuously extend about 10\u00a0km and show obvious linear and potholed distribution on WorldView-2 remote sensing imagery (Fig. 4\na). These fluorite-bearing vertical to sub-vertical veins are in parallel or subparallel en echelon arrangement, forming three NNE-NE striking orebelts with positive terrain on the outcrop (Fig. 4b-c).\nThe size of individual mineralized bodies varies greatly: They range from 50\u00a0m to >2\u00a0km in strike length; usually 5\u20138\u00a0m and up to 20\u00a0m (the largest one of the known orebodies in the mining area) in width. The vertical extension of orebodies was found to be positively correlated with their scale, most of which extend vertically >300\u00a0m as verified by the EH4 continuous conductivity profile and drill cores in Linxi (Pei et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021).\nThe deposits have similar and relatively simple ore mineral assemblage. They are composed essentially of fluorite, quartz and calcite. In addition, minor quantities of uneconomic sulphides (pyrite, lead, sphalerite, etc.) could be recognized. Fluorite is the sole mineral of economic value found in the mining area. The above signatures are similar to the fluorite districts located along the Rio Grande graben in western USA and the Baikal rift zone in Russia and Mongolia (Zappettini et al., 2017). According to the exploration reports, ore grade is quite variable with an average value ranging from \u223c45% to \u223c88% (Pei, 2018). Mineral textures observed in the outcrops and under the microscope are highly variable (Fig. 5\na) and mainly include: 1) lattice quartz; 2) comb quartz; 3) ring-banded fluorite & quartz; 4) cubic fluorite; 5) fluorite stockworks; 6) fluorite-bearing veinlets; 7) Colloform-banded opal & fluorite; 8) striped fluorite; 9) crustiform aggregate; 10) fluorite breccias; 11) bladed calcite (or replaced by quartz) and 12) rosette-shaped calcite.\nBased on the field and microscopic observations, mineral paragenetic sequences at deposit scale could be at least divided into three stages. Stage \u2160 formed quartz-fluorite or barren quartz veins hosted in fractures near the surrounding rocks. Ore bodies formed at this stage consist mainly of quartz and fluorite with low grade (Fig. 5b). Euhedral quartz with comb structure is well developed in the open cracks and cavities near the surface of the ore body (Fig. 5c). Stage \u2161 produced abundant fluorite, which significantly increases the ore grade. The early-stage fluorite breccias could be easily recognized on the outcrop (Fig. 5d). Stage III is characterized by the development of calcite veins or breccias. Individual or sets of quartz-calcite veinlets often crosscut previous stages (\u2160 & \u2161) fluorite veins (Fig. 5e-g).\n\n\n\n4\nMethodology\nAll the samples were collected from the field outcrops, drilling cores and underground mine workings across the mining district. More than 100 doubly polished sections were prepared for microscopic observation and fluid inclusion study. Fluorite, quartz and calcite separation was carried out at Langfang Chengxin Geological Services Ltd., Hebei Province, China. The separated fluorite, calcite, and quartz grains were selected for Sm-Nd dating, C\u2013H-O isotope and trace elements analysis.\nA total of nine calcite specimens associated fluorite mineralization from Sandaoyingzi were selected for Sm-Nd isotope analysis. The Sm and Nd isotope determinations were performed using a VG-354 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at the Center of Modern Analysis Nanjing University. Analytical procedures can be found in (Peng et al., 2003). Replicate analyses of the 143Nd\/144Nd ratio of the American La Jolla isotopic standard sample yielded the value of 0.511860\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 (2\u03c3, n\u00a0=\u00a08). Nd ratios were normalized to 146Nd\/144Nd\u00a0=\u00a00.7219. Final Sm-Nd isochron age calculation performed using Ludwig\u2019s ISOTOPE Program.\nFluid inclusions petrography and microthermometric measurements were conducted using a Linkam MDSG 600 cooling-heating stage attached to a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope at the State Key Laboratory of Geo-Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, China. The measurement range was between \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C to +600\u00a0\u00b0C. During the microthermometric analyses, the heating and cooling rate were both set at \u226415\u00a0\u00b0C\/min; while near the phase transition point, the above rate was 0.1\u20131\u00a0\u00b0C\/min. In addition, some repeated measurements were carried out to ensure the accuracy of the test results.\nTrace element concentrations were determined using Finnigan MAT Element I ICP-MS at the Laboratory of Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology (BRIUG), following the procedures described by (Wang et al., 2015a). Samples were collected from the Sandaoyingzi and Baoshan deposits, involving 33 separated fluorite, calcite, and quartz grains of different ore-forming stages. The analytical precision for trace elements was better than 5%.\nCarbon, hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions were measured by Finnigan MAT-253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer at the BRIUG. Nine fluorite and three quartz separates were selected for H-O isotope analysis, and five calcite separates were C-O isotope analysis. The reproducibility for carbon, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes was \u00b10.2\u2030, \u00b12\u2030 and \u00b10.2\u2030, respectively. Further details on analytical procedures were given by (Cao et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2021).\n\n\n5\nAnalytical results\n\n5.1\nCalcite Sm-Nd age\nThe calcite Sm-Nd isotopic data are summarized in Table 1\n. The Sm and Nd concentrations of the calcite samples range from 0.0698 to 0.6297\u00a0ppm and 0.2526 to 1.629\u00a0ppm, respectively. The samples have 147Sm\/144Nd and 143Nd\/144Nd ratios of 0.1027\u20130.5982 and 0.512311\u20130.512754, respectively. All analyses yield Sm-Nd isochron age of 120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049\u00a0Ma with high MSWD value of 465 (Fig. 6\na). However, there are obviously two discrete points (SDY-C05 and SDY-C07) compared with the other analyses on the Sm\u2013Nd isochron diagram. Omitting the above two samples, the remaining seven calcite separates define a more precise isochron age of 136.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0Ma with low MSWD value of 2.9 (Fig. 6b), and the initial ratio of 143Nd\/144Nd is 0.5122176\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0000086. The result is close to that of the Shuitou deposit (\u223c132\u00a0Ma, Pei et al., 2017) in Linxi district and represents the ore-forming age of the Sandaoyingzi deposit.\n\n\n5.2\nFluid inclusions\nThe samples from the mining area are rich in Fluid inclusions (FIs), making it suitable for the investigations of FIs petrography and microthermometry. Based on phase relationships at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, optical observations over 300 inclusions identified four main types of FIs in Linxi (Fig. 7\n). Pure liquid (PL-) type inclusions contain mono-phase liquid and occur as clusters or randomly distributed together with other type inclusion (Fig. 7a, d&e). PL-type inclusions are irregular and small in size, usually less than 10\u00a0\u03bcm. Liquid-rich (L-type) inclusions are common (accounting for up to 90%) in the host minerals at each stage of mineralization. L-type inclusions are biphase with the vapor phase ranging from 5 to 20\u00a0vol% of the whole inclusion and vastly more abundant than other type inclusions. They are variable in size (5 to 60\u00a0\u03bcm) and commonly have elongated, triangular, elliptical or irregular shapes (Fig. 7). Vapor-rich two-phase (V-type) inclusions occur mostly as isolated in early-stage fluorite and quartz crystals and show rounded or regular shapes. They are less than 40\u00a0\u03bcm, with vapor volumetric percent of 55%-90%. Solid-bearing inclusions (S-type) refer to the daughter mineral-bearing three phase FIs and are rare in the study area. The daughter minerals within FIs are round or irregular in shape and generally do not disappear completely during heating.\nMore than 200 fluid inclusions were confined to primary in origin following the criteria of Roedder (1984) for freezing and heating experiments. The microthermometric data are listed in Table 2\n. It is obvious that the homogenization temperature and salinity of the FIs in different fluorite deposits within the Linxi district share consistent features. The L-type FIs homogenized to liquid, while the majority of the V-type Fls homogenized to Vapor. Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions hosted in fluorite and quartz are similar and vary from 110\u00a0\u00b0C to 350\u00a0\u00b0C, with a peak between 140\u00a0\u00b0C and 220\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 8\na). According to the revised equation of H2O-NaCl system (Bodnar, 1993), the calculated salinities of the FIs range from 0.18 to 6.88\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent, with a peak at 0.3\u20131.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent. The pressures and densities estimated from the L- and V-type FIs are 2.6\u2013162\u00a0bar and 0.44\u20130.96\u00a0g\/cm3, respectively. For the individual deposits within the Linxi district, both homogenization temperatures and salinities gradually decrease from early stage to late stage (Table 2).\n\n\n5.3\nTrace elements\nSupplementary Table 1 shows the analytical results of (REE\u00a0+\u00a0Y) (REY hereinafter) of the fluorite, calcite and quartz samples from the Sandaoyingzi and Baoshan, and also concludes previous data of Shuitou and Xiaobigou deposits (Pei et al., 2017; Pei et al., 2019). The corresponding chondrite-normalized REE patterns are shown in Fig. 3. For different minerals, the REY contents in fluorite and calcite are notably higher than those in quartz. Both fluorite and calcite are abundant in calcium (Ca) since Ca2+ and REY have similar ionic radii (Brugger et al., 2000). Therefore, compared with quartz, Calcium-bearing minerals such as fluorite and calcite have a stronger capacity to accommodate REY.\nThe total REE (\u03a3REE) contents in fluorite vary over a wide range from a few ppm to a high of 195\u00a0ppm. REE in Baoshan fluorite are generally higher than the other deposits. There are also differences among different ore deposits for chondrite-normalized REE patterns. The Sandaoyingzi and Baoshan are relatively HREE-enriched with average LREE\/HREE value of 0.39 and 0.61, respectively. In contrast, the Shuitou and Xiaobeigou show similar and relatively flat patterns. Three samples (BS-F01, BS-F05 and BS-F07) have positive Eu anomalies with \u03b4Eu value ranging between 1.17 with 1.58, whereas the other samples in Baoshan show significant negative Eu anomalies with REE patterns akin to \u201cchevron\u201d type (Fig. 9\nb). Compared to Baoshan, most crystals from other deposits have no or slightly positive Eu anomalies (Fig. 9a-d). All chondrite-normalized REE patterns in Linxi lack pronounced Ce anomalies which are marked by the \u03b4Ce ratios between 0.88 and 1.15.\nThe calcites in Sandaoyingzi and Shuitou have \u03a3REE contents ranging from only 2.31 to 20.63\u00a0ppm and from 24.97 to 86.98\u00a0ppm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9e, the REE patterns of calcites in Sandaoyingzi and Shuitou exhibit slight differences. The Sandaoyingzi is HREE-enriched with weak positive Eu anomalies (mean \u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a01.13), while the Shuitou is characterized by LREE-enriched with variable \u03b4Eu value (0.46\u20131.48). All the quartz samples in Linxi have low REY concentrations marked by the contents of \u03a3REE less than 7.88\u00a0ppm. Their chondrite-normalized REE patterns show relatively flat trends similar to each other (Fig. 9f).\n\n\n5.4\nC\u2013H-O isotopes geochemistry\nThe obtained hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions from the Sandaoyingzi deposit, together with H-O isotopic data from the Shuitou and Xiaobeigou deposits are provided in Table 3\n. For quartz samples, the \u03b418OH2O values for fluids were balanced with quartz and calculated based on the isotope fractionation equation of 1000ln\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a03.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\/T2\u20133.40 given by (Clayton et al., 1972). The \u201cT\u201d involved in the above formula adopts the homogenization temperature of FIs hosted by quartz. Calculated \u03b418OH2O values for three quartz samples range from \u22127.61 to \u22126.81\u2030 with corresponding \u03b418D values between \u2212138.8 and \u2212131.1\u2030. Nine fluorite samples from the Sandaoyingzi show higher \u03b418OH2O values of 2.6 to 7.9\u2030 (mean 3.89\u2030) and have consistent \u03b418D values of \u2212138.4 to \u2212125.1\u2030 (mean \u2212130.5\u2030).\nThe carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of calcite samples obtained from the Sandaoyingzi and Shuitou are compiled in Table 4\n. The \u03b413CV-PDB and \u03b418OV-SMOW values of the calcite in Sandaoyingzi vary from \u22126\u2030 and \u22124.3\u2030 (mean \u22125.5\u2030) and from 1.3 to 5.2 (mean 4.2), respectively. Four calcite samples in Shuitou display relatively lower \u03b413CV-PDB and \u03b418OV-SMOW concentrations. They yield \u03b413CV-PDB and \u03b418OV-SMOW values of \u22127.1 to \u22126.3\u2030 and \u22122.8 to \u22120.7\u2030, with averages of \u22126.7 and \u22121.8\u2030, respectively.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nTiming of fluorite mineralization and geodynamic setting\nThe Sm\u2013Nd isotopic systematics is considered to be relatively robust and highly resistant to weathering and alteration (Peng et al., 2003). For calcic minerals such as fluorite, calcite and scheelite, REE could replace Ca2+ into the mineral crystal lattice. Thus, the daughter 143Nd decayed from the parent 147Sm could be easily preserved in such mineral lattice. As proved by numerous prior studies, Sm\u2013Nd dating of calcic minerals could provide rigorous constraint on the ore-forming age of hydrothermal mineralization (Barker et al., 2009; Castorina et al., 2020; Chesley et al., 1991; Fang et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2009; Munoz et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2015). In this contribution, seven calcite separates from Sandaoyingzi yield high-precision isochron age of 136.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0Ma. On the 147Sm\/144Nd\u2013143Nd\/144Nd diagram (Fig. 6), all the points display a good linear relationship with low MSWD values of 2.9, which presents the formation age of the Sandaoyingzi deposit. Similarly, we also obtained fluorite Sm-Nd isochron age of 132\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0Ma of Shuitou within the Linxi district (Pei et al., 2017). In addition, Cao et al.(2013) carried out geochronological studies measured by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) in quartz from several deposits in Linxi district and obtained ESR ages of 157.3\u2013126.6\u00a0Ma with an average of \u223c137\u00a0Ma. The above data support the hypothesis that the main surge of fluorite mineralization in Linxi district occurred approximately 137\u2013132\u00a0Ma (Early Cretaceous). Geochronological data published in the southern GXR and its adjacent areas record that the age peaks of regional magmatism, polymetallic and fluorite mineralization have good consistency and all concentrated at 150\u2013120\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10\na) (Ouyang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020 and references therein). This agreement suggests that the large-scale fluorite mineralization may be linked to the Late Mesozoic metallogenic events in the GXR related to the Yanshanian Orogeny (see discussion in Mao et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2017).\nOn a larger scale, although accurate dating of fluorite mineralization in eastern China is relatively scarce, it shows interesting temporal-spatial variation trends. As shown in Fig. 10b, 1) southern GXR and its adjacent areas: large-scale fluorite mineralization occurred in the Early Cretaceous (142\u2013132\u00a0Ma); 2) northern Shandong Peninsula: fluorite veins in Jushangou and Hongbu deposits cuts through Cretaceous volcanic rocks such as Qingshan Group (106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma, Ling et al., 2006), which indicates that the formation age of the fluorite deposits in this area was less than 106\u00a0Ma (Yu et al., 2016); 3) Heyu fluorite district of the East Qinling: fluorite mineralization in the Madiu and Angou deposits occurred at \u223c119\u00a0Ma (Zhao et al., 2020); 4) Zhejiang fluorite district of the southeast China: geochronological data show that fluorite epigenetic vein deposits in the Zhejiang Province mainly formed at \u223c110\u201370\u00a0Ma with an obvious NE-SW trend (Fang et al., 2020). The metallogenic age of fluorite deposits in eastern China presents a gradually decreasing trend from northwest to southeast. This spatio-temporal distribution pattern of large-scale fluorite mineralization is likely linked to complex tectonic settings. It is worth pointing out that such temporal\u2013spatial framework of the vein-type fluorite deposits in eastern China requires more accurate geochronological data to support. The Early stage of the Early Cretaceous fluorite deposits in the southern GXR are most likely associated with the extensional tectonic setting formed by the collapse of thickened continental crust after the closure of Mongolia-Okhotsk Ocean (Tang et al., 2018). Additionally, other fluorite deposits occurred in the northern Shandong Peninsula, east Qinling and southeast China are mainly the product of (paleo-) Pacific plate subduction or northeastward subduction of the Neo-Tethys plate (Yan et al., 2021).\n\n\n6.2\nNature of the ore-forming fluids\nFluid inclusions (FIs) hosted by the ore mineral (fluorite) can provide more reliable estimates on the nature of ore-forming fluids and also minimize uncertainties (Wilkinson, 2001; Tang et al., 2021a,b). Thus, the FIs study was mainly focused on those hosted by fluorite crystal associated with minor quartz and calcite crystals. FIs in Linxi district are dominated by L-type together with minor V-type and PL-type. In addition, ore textures such as lattice, comb, colloform-banded grains can be widely observed during field investigation. According to these characteristics combined with the coexistence of the above FIs type, fluorite mineralization is interpreted to have occurred in an open system under low pressures and temperatures (Akaryali, 2016; Moncada et al., 2012). Based on FIs data, the total homogenization temperatures were characterized by low temperatures (mainly 140\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C), corresponding to low salinities (mainly 0.3\u20131.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent). The calculated densities and pressures are of 0.44\u20130.96\u00a0g\/cm3 (mean \u223c0.88\u00a0g\/cm3) and 2.6\u2013162\u00a0bar, respectively. For individual deposits at Linxi, the homogenization temperatures and salinities slightly decrease from an early stage to a late stage. Taking Xiaobeigou as an example, the total homogenization temperatures gradually decreased mainly from 180 to 240\u00a0\u00b0C for FIs hosted by early-stage fluorite and quartz, and concentrating at 160\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C for the late-stage. Likewise, the salinities also show a slightly decreasing trend from 0.18 to 1.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent of the early stage to 0.18\u20130.88\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent during the late stage. Such regularities of fluid evolution mimic those of vein-type fluorite deposits in eastern China (Zhao et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2019). As revealed by Laser Raman spectra (Pei et al., 2017; Pei et al., 2019), both vapor phase and liquid phase of the L-type FIs in Shuitou and Xiaobeigou deposits yielded peaks of H2O and host mineral (quartz or fluorite), indicating the phase components of the FIs are dominated by H2O. Accordingly, the fluorite ore-forming fluids belong to low temperatures, low salinities and low densities of the H2O\u2013NaCl system. As discussed above, the FIs in Linxi district share similar petrographic characteristics and are dominated by the liquid-rich two-phase type with low temperatures and salinities. In the \u03b418O versus \u03b413C diagram, the calcite samples obtained in Sandaoyingzi and Xiaobeigou deposits mainly fall along the meteoric water trend line (Fig. 11\n), which suggested a meteoric-dominated origin. As for the H-O isotope, \u03b418OH2O and \u03b418D values of samples from the Linxi district (including Shuitou, xiaobeigou and Sandaoyingzi deposits) are plotted close to the meteoric water line. To further explore the origin of the mineralizing fluids, here we integrated the H-O isotopic composition of fluorite deposits in eastern China. It is proposed that a latitude effect on \u03b4D values was confirmed for fluorite deposits in eastern China. Specifically, the \u03b4D value of fluorite deposits in eastern China decreases with the increasing of latitude (Fig. 12\n), implying a significant origin of meteoric water. It is worth pointing out that samples also show a horizontal trend (\u201cO shift\u201d) extending from the meteoric water line, which resulted from possible fluid\u2013rock interactions during fluorite mineralization (Kesler et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2021). \u03a3REE contents of early-stage fluorite are higher than those of late-stage fluorite but share similar chondrite-normalized REE patterns, which reveal a relatively homogeneous fluid system. With the crystallization and precipitation of early-stage fluorite, the residual fluid system would deplete in REE, which resulted in lower concentrations for late-stage fluorite (Assadzadeh et al., 2017; Pei et al., 2019).\nY and Ho have similar geochemical behaviors, its Y\/Ho ratio of fluorite in a hydrothermal system has been used to effectively constrain the fluid processes (Bau and Dulski, 1995b; Graupner et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2006). Y tends to be more enriched than Ho in the fluorine-rich aqueous fluids system, and thus the Y\/Ho ratio is generally >28 (Veksler et al., 2005). Although REE contents in Linxi district are variable, Y\/Ho ratios of fluorite samples display a narrow range of 35.6\u201339.5 for Sandaoyingzi, 27.4\u201361.4 for Baoshan, 31.7\u201340.0 for Shuitou, and 28.7\u201347.1 for Xiaobeigou. In addition, quartz and calcite samples in Linxi district also show similar Y\/Ho ratios. In the Y\/Ho versus La\/Ho diagram (Fig. 13\na), all the fluorite samples exhibit a narrow horizontal distribution with similar recrystallization trend, suggesting a common origin (Bau and Dulski, 1995b; Mahdy et al., 2014). Tb\/La ratios in the fluorite samples of Linxi range from 0.12 to1.01 with an average value of 0.43 (n\u00a0=\u00a023), and such low values suggest that fluorites were crystallized from a less evolved fluid (M\u00f6ller et al., 1976). Furthermore, the Tb\/Ca versus Tb\/La bivariate diagram can effectively differentiate the genesis of fluorite (M\u00f6ller et al., 1976; Wang et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 13b, most of the fluorite samples fall within the hydrothermal field, which supports a hydrothermal origin. In addition, minor samples fall in the sedimentary fields, implying that water\u2013rock reactions occurred especially during the late stage (Pei et al., 2019). As a consequence, we infer that the fluorites in Linxi district have a common hydrothermal origin and the mineralizing fluids are dominantly of meteoric water origin.\n\n\n6.3\nOre-forming process\nBased on the above investigation, the genetic model of fluorite mineralization in Linxi district could be simply synthesized as follows. At the end of Late Paleozoic to the Early Mesozoic, the Siberia Craton merged with the North China Craton caused by the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean along the Solonker\u2013Xar Moron suture zone (Li et al., 2021; Pei et al., 2018). Due to the opposite compression of the two plates, complex fold belts and nearly EW-oriented regional faults developed in the southern GXR, which controlled the formation and distribution of Yanshanian fault uplift belts, fault depression belts and Mesozoic volcanic-sedimentary basins. NNE-NE-trending structures were developed during the Mesozoic, and the regime changed from NNW\u2013SSE-trending compression to NW\u2013SE-trending extension in Early Cretaceous (Liu et al., 2017). As a consequence, large-scale crustal thinning and asthenosphere upwelling occurred in the region, which producing coeval widespread A-type granites in the GXR (Wu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020) and also brought large amounts of F. Faults in the extensional belt could act as channels for fluid to flow to the shallow crust, while normal faults contributed to the deep circulation and heating of a large amount of atmospheric precipitation, and magmatic activities in the recent period provide power and heat source for fluid migration (Broom-Fendley et al., 2017).\nDuring the formation and evolution of Mesozoic volcanic-sedimentary basins, on the one hand, the deposits of terrigenous pyroclastic materials were continuously deposited, meanwhile, F and Ca elements in volcanic-sedimentary rocks in the basins and their surrounding areas were transported and migrated to the center of the basins for enrichment. On the other hand, this fluid-rich basin has been subjected to surface water leaching and groundwater circulation for a long time, and could continuously extract F and Ca elements from the F-rich rocks. As a result, F-rich mineralizing fluids would be generated through a series of complex hydrothermal processes. As the ore-bearing fluids ascended to the shallow part of the surface along the major fractures or breccia zones, the sudden change of physical\u2013chemical conditions and mixing with meteoric water contributed to the phase separation of ore-bearing hydrothermal solution (Damdinova and Reyf, 2008; Robb, 2005). These processes caused subsequent precipitation of fluorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0calcite veins in Linxi district.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nFluorite deposits in the Linxi district share similar and relatable geological features. There is no selectivity for fluorite mineralization to host rocks. Fluorite often occur as sets of veins which were strictly controlled by steeply dipping \u223cS-N-, NNE-SSW- and NE-SW-striking fault zones. The deposits within the Ore mineral assemblage are quite simple in the study area and mainly include fluorite, quartz and calcite. Fluorite is the sole mineral of economic value found in the mining area.\n\n\n(2)\nThe calcite samples in Sandaoyingzi deposit yield Sm-Nd isochron age of 136.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a02.9). Combined with similar geological characteristics and geochronological data within the Linxi district, we concluded that the main surge of fluorite mineralization in Linxi district occurred approximately 137\u2013132\u00a0Ma, which has good consistency with the age peaks of regional magmatism and polymetallic mineralization. The Early Cretaceous fluorite deposits in the southern GXR are most likely associated with the extensional tectonic setting. Furthermore, the metallogenic age of fluorite deposits in eastern China presents a gradually decreasing trend from northwest to southeast.\n\n\n(3)\nFluid inclusions obtained from the Linxi district are dominated by two phase liquid-rich inclusions. Total homogenization temperatures were characterized by low temperatures (mainly 140\u2013220\u00a0\u00b0C), corresponding to low salinities (mainly 0.3\u20131.2\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent). The calculated densities and pressures are of 0.44\u20130.96\u00a0g\/cm3 (mean \u223c0.88\u00a0g\/cm3) and 2.6\u2013162\u00a0bar, respectively. C\u2013H-O isotopic data from the study area indicate an origin of meteoric water. Ore-forming fluids belong to low temperatures, low salinities and low densities H2O\u2013NaCl system and are dominantly of meteoric water origin.\n\n\n(4)\nThe REY geochemistry studies indicate that fluorite, quartz and calcite in this area share a common hydrothermal origin. Fluorite mineralization in the study area experienced a series of complex hydrothermal processes.\n\n\n\n\n","47":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe North China Craton (NCC) is the largest and oldest continental block in China, with basement rocks as old as ca. 3.8\u00a0Ga (Liu et al., 1992). The NCC is bound to the north by the Paleozoic Central Asian orogenic belt, to the south by the Palaeozoic to early Mesozoic Qinling\u2013Dabie\u2013Sulu orogenic belt, and to the east by the Mesozoic\u2013Cenozoic Circum-Pacific accretionary belt (e.g., Xiao et al., 2003; Miao et al., 2005, Zhai et al., 2002, 2004) (Fig. 1\na). Along these tectonic boundaries, gold deposits have been identified, as in comparable settings elsewhere (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 1998). The deposits are typically clustered along the inner margin of the NCC, especially in its eastern part (Fig. 1a).\nNumerous studies have examined the gold deposits in the eastern NCC, and a consensus regarding the tectonic setting for the formation of gold deposits has been reached. It is considered that they were formed in a tectonic setting of extension or transitional from compression to extension (e.g., Zeng et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020), which was related to the large-scale lithosphere thinning or decratonisation of the eastern NCC during the late Mesozoic (e.g., Zhai et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). The mineralization time of these gold deposits is ca. 120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma (Zhu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). However, the distribution and metallogenic density of the gold deposits in the eastern NCC, including those on Jiaodong and Liaodong peninsulas, are highly heterogeneous, and the key controls on the heterogeneity remain uncertain.\nJiaodong and Liaodong peninsulas are both located on the northwestern side of the Dabie\u2013Sulu suture zone. They are metallogenically similar, including similar tectonic setting, mineralization characteristics, tectono-magmatic history, and mineralization age (e.g., Li et al., 2015a; Zeng et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020). Confusingly, the endowment of gold estimated in the two gold districts differs markedly. Jiaodong Peninsula, the largest gold-producing area in China, contains proven gold reserves of\u00a0>\u00a05000\u00a0t (Deng et al., 2020). The proven gold reserves on Liaodong Peninsula are only ca. 500\u00a0t (Zeng et al., 2019). In contrast to the intense geophysical exploration of the Jiaodong gold district, exploration of the Liaodong gold district is still ongoing. It is speculated that the deep part of Liaodong Peninsula may have additional gold potential remaining to be identified through further geophysical exploration. This speculation has been reinforced by the discovery of Lode V163, the largest auriferous quartz vein in the Liaodong Peninsula so far. The lode has a strike length of\u00a0>\u00a01200\u00a0m and a vertical extent of 920\u00a0m below the surface at an average grade of 6.28\u00a0g\/t Au (Yu et al., 2018, 2020a). As a result, the deep part below the Liaodong Peninsula has become an important focus of gold exploration.\nAmbient noise tomography is regarded as one of the major recent breakthroughs in seismology (Yang et al., 2011). The rapid development of ambient noise tomography during the last two decades has shown that this method is efficient in revealing shallow crustal structures at both regional (e.g., Sabra et al., 2005; Shapiro et al., 2005) and continental scales (e.g., Yang et al., 2007b, 2008a, 2010, 2011). Recently, short-period dense arrays have been developed to image shallow structures rapidly, taking advantage of the low-cost and high-speed characteristics of deployment of ambient noise tomography. Ambient noise tomography based on short-period arrays can identify small-scale faults and geological bodies and thus has been widely used in studies of small regions and\/or ore fields (Du et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2020c; Fang et al., 2015; Mordret et al., 2019; Roux et al., 2016). For example, Lin et al. (2013) extracted phase velocity dispersion curves from a dense array consisting of 5204 short-period stations in Long Beach, California to inverse a crustal velocity structure of the top 1\u00a0km and found that the distribution of the shallow velocity anomalies has a clear correlation with the known faults. Li et al. (2016) combined seismic data obtained from 17 seismometers separated by an average interval of\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.0\u20132.0\u00a0km with borehole data to obtain S-wave velocity measurements from as shallow as 30\u00a0m in the Hefei Basin. Wang et al. (2018a) used 203 short-period seismographs deployed in the Xinjiang Basin, Jiangxi Province in China with a spacing of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0m and obtained a high-resolution velocity structure at 0\u20131.4\u00a0km depths. Du et al. (2020) deployed 100 short-period dense stations with 500\u2013700\u00a0m spacing at the Kalatongke Cu-Ni Mine, Xinjiang, to obtain a high-resolution 3D model of structures for a depth range of 0\u20131.3\u00a0km below the mine. Yu et al. (2020c) deployed a linear short-period dense array (including 340 stations) with a spacing of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0500\u00a0m on Jiaodong Peninsula to obtain a 2D velocity model for depths between 0 and 8\u00a0km and investigated the relationship between late Mesozoic extensional structures and gold mineralization in the Jiaodong district. The above studies have demonstrated that ambient noise tomography based on short-period arrays can obtain high-resolution velocity structures of the upper crust and is able to identify ore-controlling structures and plutons in goldfields. Therefore, ambient noise tomography should be of high utility for guiding deep ore prospecting.\nTo better understand the gold potential in the deep part of Liaodong Peninsula, we performed an ambient noise tomography study in the WLGF by deploying a short-period dense seismic array, which is referred to as WSP array hereafter. The WLGF was selected for our study for the following reasons: (1) The WLGF is the most productive area of gold on Liaodong Peninsula; it contains the largest auriferous quartz vein system and has similar metallogenic characteristics to those of the Linglong gold deposit on Jiaodong Peninsula, both of which host quartz-vein type gold mineralization; (2) Drilling has ascertained that auriferous quartz veins extend vertically to at least 900\u00a0m below the surface and a study of structurally superimposed halos suggested a high gold potential in the deeper part of the Wulong gold deposit (Yu et al., 2020b); (3) Geophysical investigations, including gravity, magnetic, and electrical surveys (Gu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019b; Du et al., 2018) provide a good basis for assessing the results of our ambient noise tomography study.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nLiaodong and Jiaodong peninsulas including part of the Bohai Sea are part of the \u201cJiao\u2013Liao Uplift\u201d along the northwestern marging of the Sulu HP\u2013UHP metamorphic belt. This belt is the suture zone between the South China Craton and the NCC. It extends into the Korean Peninsula to the east (Fig. 1).\nThe basement of Liaodong Peninsula consists of metamorphic rocks of the Archaean Anshan Group and the Paleoproterozoic Liaohe Group. The Anshan Group is mainly distributed in the Liaobei and Liaonan terranes of the Liaodong Peninsula, comprises mainly tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite and metamorphosed supracrustal rocks (Liu et al., 1992; Gu et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2020). The Archaean rocks of the Anshan Group host the largest banded iron formation type iron deposit in China.\nThe Paleoproterozoic Liaohe Group is distributed between the Archaean Liaobei and Liaonan terranes and is considered to represent a sedimentary sequence that formed in the Liaohe Rift. The Liaohe Group is subdivided, from bottom to top, into Langzishan, Lieryu, Gaojiayu, Dashiqiao, and Gaixian formations (Luo et al., 2004; Zeng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020a). The Langzishan Formation comprises mainly biotite\u2013chlorite schist and garnet\u2013staurolite\u2013mica schist. The Lieryu Formation has been referred to as a \u201cboron-bearing stratigraphic unit\u201d and consists mostly of magnetite- and tourmaline-bearing gneisses with amphibolite lenses and hosts boron and magnetite deposits. The Gaojiayu Formation comprises predominantly graphite\u2013bearing schists and biotite schists intercalated with marbles, which is the main host rock of lead\u2013zinc deposits on Liaodong Peninsula. The Dashiqiao Formation comprises mainly thick-layered dolomitic marbles, with two-mica schists and carbonacous slate layers. It hosts mineral deposits of magnesite and talc. The Gaixian Formation comprises chiefly phyllite, staurolite\u2013mica schist, sillimanite\u2013two-mica schist, and minor amounts of marbles (Gao et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015b; Zeng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020a). The Liaohe Group underwent greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ca. 1.85\u00a0Ga, corresponding to the time of NCC cratonisation (Li et al., 2015b).\nThe early Precambrian basement of Liaodong Peninsula is unconformably overlain by Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Yongning Group and Cambrian\u2013Ordovician shallow-marine carbonates and mudstones, which in turn are overlain by Carboniferous\u2013Permian alternating marine- and continental-facies coal-bearing formations. The Yongning Group is characterized by a sequence of wild-flysch formations (Yu et al., 2020a). Mesoproterozoic, Silurian\u2013Devonian, and Triassic strata are absent on Liaodong Peninsula.\nLiaodong Peninsula is intruded by granitic rocks of variable ages, including Archaean, Paleoproterozoic, and Mesozoic granites. It should be noted that many granitoids that were previously assigned with Paleoproterozoic ages have subsequently been confirmed to have early Mesozoic emplacement ages (Yang et al., 2008b), meaning that Mesozoic magmatism was more intense and widespread than previously thought. Mesozoic magmatism on Liaodong Peninsula occurred episodically, mainly during the Middle to Late Triassic, Late Jurassic, and Early Cretaceous (e.g., Wu et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007a, 2012). The Middle to Late Triassic magmatism formed intrusive rocks, without eruptive equivalents, whereas the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous magmatism involved both phases. The Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks are distributed mainly within Mesozoic faulted basins on the Liaodong Peninsula. It is generally accepted that the collision between the NCC and the South China Craton caused large-scale magmatic activity in the Middle to Late Triassic (Quan et al., 2020), whereas the Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous magmatism was attributed to the lithospheric thinning or decratonisation of the eastern NCC (Sun et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2005). The westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the East Asian continent dominated the geodynamics of the lithospheric thinning or decratonisation (e.g., Zhu et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020a). Large-scale gold emplacement accompanied the widespread magmatic activity during the Jurassic\u2013Cretaceous, referred by some authors to as the \u201cMesozoic Metallogenic Explosion\u201d (MME; e.g., Li et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2015). The vast majority of gold deposits on both the Liaodong and Jiaodong peninsulas were formed during the MME.\nDuring the Cenozoic, the eastern NCC, including Liaodong Peninsula, experienced the eruption of alkaline basalts with geochemical characteristics of ocean island basalts (Fang et al., 2020). These alkaline basalts are sparsely distributed along major NE-trending faults.\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the WLGF\nAccording to the time\u2013space distribution and metallogenic characteristics of the gold deposits, Liaodong Peninsula is divided into three areas of gold concentration: the Qingchengzi, Maoling, and Wulong goldfields (Zeng et al., 2019). The Qingchengzi goldfield is located in northern Liaodong Peninsula and hosts several gold deposits, such as the Baiyun, Xiaotongjiapu, and Linjiasandaogou (Liu et al., 2020a). The Maoling goldfield includes several large gold deposits (such as Maoling) and other smaller deposits and occurrences (Yu et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2017). The WLGF hosts two large-scale gold deposits, Wulong and Sidaogou, as well as some small-scale gold deposits and occurrences (Feng et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020a). Among these, the Wulong gold deposit is the most important, with>80\u00a0t of Au at an average grade of 5.35\u00a0g\/t (Yu et al., 2020a; Fig. 1a). The gold deposits in the WLGF are mainly of quartz-vein type, whereas the disseminated and stockwork style of gold mineralization hosted in altered tectonic zones has also been found nearby.\nCountry rocks of the deposits in the WLGF belong to the Paleoproterozoic Liaohe Group and the Neoproterozoic Yongning Group (Zeng et al., 2019). For the Liaohe Group, only the Lieryu and Gaixian Formations are present and are distributed in the southeastern part of the WLGF, and the Gaixian Formation comprises predominantly mica schist. The Yongning Group, composed of quartz sandstone, is distributed near the Sidaogou gold deposit in the southeast of the WLGF (Duan et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2020a).\nThe WLGF is intruded by Mesozoic granitic rocks, with the Wulong, Sanguliu, and Wulongbei plutons being the main representatives. The Wulong pluton, emplaced in the Late Jurassic with a zircon U\u2013Pb age of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0160\u00a0Ma, is widely distributed in the WLGF and is mainly composed of two-mica granite and biotite granite (Wang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2020a). The Sanguliu pluton in the southeastern portion of the goldfield is composed of monzogranite and granodiorite and shows lithological zoning, with the monzogranite in the centre and the granodiorite (as well as a minor amount of quartz diorite) at the margin. Zircon dating has revealed that the central monzogranite and marginal granodiorite were formed simultaneously, with emplacement ages of 131\u2013120\u00a0Ma (Early Cretaceous) (Wang et al., 2020). The Wulongbei pluton in the northern part of the goldfield is a monzonitic granite and shows a porphyritic structure. This pluton was emplaced during the Early Cretaceous as indicated by its zircon U\u2013Pb age of 127\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma (Wu et al., 2005).\nThere are two groups of faults that were mapped in the WLGF, which extend NNE and NW, respectively (Yu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Of these, the NNE-trending group of faults is predominant and is widely distributed in the WLGF. The NNE-trending faults, interpreted as subsidiary faults of the Yalujiang Fault to the southeast of the goldfield, strike about 25\u201330\u00b0 and dip to the NW, with steep dip angles of 50\u00b0\u201380\u00b0 (Zhang et al., 2019b). The NW-trending faults are only locally exposed in the northeastern WLGF and show a general strike of about 320\u00b0 and dip to the SW at 50\u201370\u00b0 (Gu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019b). These two groups of faults, which are considered to be conjugate, constitute the main structural framework of the WLGF and control the spatial distribution of gold deposits (Gu et al., 2020).\n\n\n2.3\nGeology of the Wulong gold deposit\nThe Wulong gold deposit is situated in the northwestern part of the Sanguliu pluton (Fig. 1). Besides the granitic plutons, there are many dikes of different composition and orientation. These dykes are mainly Early Cretaceous in age (Yu et al., 2020a) including fine-grained diorite, granitic porphyry, dolerite, and lamprophyre. The fine-grained diorite dykes strike mainly NNE, NW, or N. The granitic porphyry dykes (>2 m wide and thousands of meters long) strike N or NNE and are distributed mainly in the east of Wulong. The lamprophyre and dolerite dykes (\u223c1 m wide and\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0m long) strike N or E. In addition, some diorite porphyry and granitic pegmatite dykes are also found in the deposit. The granitic porphyry and fine-grained diorite dykes generally crosscut the auriferous quartz veins (Yu et al., 2020a) suggesting their emplacement postdating the gold mineralization.\nThe Wulong orebodies are chiefly distributed in between the Jixingou and 100# Faults, two major regional NNE-trending faults (Fig. 2\n). Nevertheless the orebodies are directly hosted by small-scale faults that are different in orientation from the regional faults. It is suggested that the sinistral movement on the Jixingou and\/or 100# Faults has led to many small-scale subsidiary faults (generally\u00a0less than\u00a01\u00a0km long) that strike N5-15\u00b0NE (dipping to the W at angles of 75\u201385\u00b0) or NW (dipping to the SW at angles of 50\u201370\u00b0). The Wulong auriferous quartz veins hosted by these subsidiary NNE- and NW-trending faults have been identified as occurring in belts (groups) with different dimensions. The largest orebody of the Wulong gold deposit is the NW-trending Lode V163 (dipping to the SW), which has a length of>1200\u00a0m and a width of>10\u00a0m, with an average gold grade of 6.28\u00a0g\/t Au (Wang et al., 2018b; Yu et al. 2018, 2020a; Zhang et al. 2019a).\n\n\n\n3\nShallow-crustal velocity structure of the WLGF\n\n3.1\nData and methods\n(1) Ambient noise data-processing\nThe data used in this work are ambient noise data obtained from the short-period dense array in the WLGF (WSP array, Fig. 2), including 334 three-component seismometers, deployed from May to June in 2019. The array covers almost all of the faults and gold deposits. The WSP array is\u00a0\u223c\u00a027\u00a0km long and\u00a0\u223c\u00a07\u00a0km wide, with an average distance of 0.5\u20131\u00a0km between stations. The original sampling rate of ambient noise seismic data is 250\u00a0Hz.\nWe processed the ambient noise data according to the processing procedure of Bensen et al. (2007). Data were cut into 1\u00a0h segments and resampled at 10\u00a0Hz. Subsequent steps involved de-meaning, de-trending, bandpass-filtering the seismogram at 0.3\u201310.0\u00a0s periods, time-domain normalizing and spectral whitening. We still removed the instrument response, even though our instruments were the same.\nWe cross-correlated the processed 1\u00a0h data between available stations and stacked corresponding 1\u00a0h cross-corrections for each station pair to obtain stacked noise cross-correlation functions (NCFs). Finally, we obtained 55,611 NCFs. Fig. 3\n presents the NCFs between station WL100 and other stations and reveals that Rayleigh surface wave signals with an apparent velocity of about 3.0\u00a0km\/s can be observed clearly at a period band of 0.3\u20132.0\u00a0s (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the NCFs at period bands of 2\u20135\u00a0s (Fig. 3b) and 5\u201310\u00a0s (Fig. 3c) appear to have strong noise at zero lag time. Therefore, we measured dispersion curves from the NCFs only at the period range of 0.3\u20132.0\u00a0s.\n(2) Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion measurement\nRayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves were extracted based on a rapid image analysis extraction method (Yao et al., 2006). This method is based on a visual interface and can automatically extract a large number of dispersion curves and check the accuracy of dispersions. We measured the group dispersion curves only from those NCFs that had signal-to-noise ratio values of\u00a0>\u00a05 and distances between two stations longer than two wavelengths. In the automatic extraction, the average velocity obtained from 1000 manually picked curves was taken as the reference velocity. We discarded group velocity dispersion curves with perturbations>0.2\u00a0km from the reference velocity. Finally, 49,211 group velocity dispersion curves were automatically extracted.\nWe found that some of the automatically picked dispersion curves were not smooth and had large oscillations according to period. However, dispersion curves must smoothly vary as a function of period. Therefore, further selection steps were implemented to discard the problematic dispersion curves. Here, we adopted a similar propagation path method to identify and discard these problematic dispersion curves manually. The main principle behind this method is that if the propagation paths of surface waves are similar, their dispersion curves must also be similar. To find similar paths, we first chose two stations as central stations and then drew two circles centred on each of the two stations with a certain radius. Then, we chose station pairs with one station located within one circle and the other station located in the other circle and treated all paths from these station pairs as similar paths. For cases where the distance between two central stations was less than 6\u00a0km, we took one-sixth of the distance between the two central stations as the radius to draw the two circles. For cases where the distance between two central stations was>6\u00a0km, we took 1.2\u00a0km as the radius. Then, all dispersion curves from the same similar paths were plotted as reference dispersion curves (blue line in Fig. 4\na) to judge whether the dispersion curve from the central station pair (red line) should be retained or discarded (Fig. 4a). If the dispersion curve from the central stations was located outside the corridor of the reference dispersion curves, then that dispersion curve was discarded.\nFollowing the above procedures, we took each of the available station pairs as the central station pair to judge whether it was reliable. Finally, 45,531 group velocity dispersion curves were retained (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c shows the number of dispersion curves for each period. Among them, there are>30,000 dispersion curves for each period less than 1.2\u00a0s, indicating that the data are highly suitable for tomography (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information).\n(3) Direct inversion for shear-wave velocity\nWe adopted the direct inversion method developed by Fang et al. (2015) to invert our dispersion data for 3D shear-wave velocity. This method employs ray tracing based on frequency and sparse constrained tomographic inversion based on wavelet, without an intermediate inversion step. We used a fast matching method (Rawlinson and Sambridge, 2004) to forward the accurate 3D shear-wave velocity model. This forward method can be used to calculate the ray paths and travel time between earthquakes and receivers.\nLSQR (least squares QR-factorization) algorithm (Paige and Saunders, 1982) was used to solve the inversion. The objective function is presented as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n(\n\nm\n\n)\n\n=\n\n|\n|\n\nd\n\n-\n\nG\n\n\nm\n\n|\n\n\n|\n\n2\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03bb\n|\n|\n\nL\n\n\nm\n\n|\n\n\n|\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nd\n is the travel time, \nL\n is the smoothing operator, \nG\n is the sensitive kernel function, m is the model parameter, and \n\u03bb\n is the weight factor between the data residual and the model regularization. In inversion, the selection of \n\u03bb\n is very important. If it is too small, the weight of the data residual will be excessive, overfitting data during inversion, resulting in unsmooth results, and mapping data residuals into the results; in contrast, if \n\u03bb\n is too large, the results will be too smooth, lacking a fine velocity structure. Therefore, to determine a reasonable \n\u03bb\n value, we tested different values of \n\u03bb\n (from 3 to 100) and plotted an L-curve (Fig. 5\n). The weight at the inflection point of 10 was picked as the optimal \n\u03bb\n value for our inversion.\n(4) Resolution tests\nTo test the robustness of our inversion results, resolution tests were performed. Fig. 6\n shows the distribution of ray paths and the sensitive kernels of Rayleigh wave group velocity at different periods, from which it can be shown that the ray path coverage at periods of 0.3\u20131.5\u00a0s is dense, with corresponding sensitive depths of 0.25\u20131.50\u00a0km. The area with the densest coverage of paths is around the WLGF, where numerous faults are developed.\nA checkboard resolution test is an effective way to examine the size of the resolvable abnormal body in tomography. We performed horizontal and vertical checkboard resolution tests, and the results revealed that our dataset has a lateral resolution of\u00a0\u223c\u00a02\u00a0km and a vertical resolution of\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.4\u00a0km at shallow depths (less than1.2\u00a0km) (Figs. S1 and S2). The variation in travel-time residuals before and after the inversion also indicates the reliability of the results (Fig. S3). More detailed results are provided in the Supplementary Information.\n\n\n3.2\nResults\nIn accordance with the empirical relationship proposed by Shearer (2019), we established an initial 1D velocity model for our inversion (Fig. 7\n). The depth of the initial model was extended to 3.0\u00a0km to avoid boundary effects and stabilize the inversion. Model parameterization in the direct inversion method followed the model presented by Boschi et al. (2020), and the velocity and density of P-waves were obtained from the empirical relationship determined by Brocher (2005). For the inversion, the grid node sizes in the latitude and longitude directions were both 0.015\u00b0 (\u223c1.6\u00a0km), and the node interval in the depth dimension was\u00a0\u223c\u00a0200\u00a0m. To check the stability of the algorithm, we tested a number of initial models; these tests showed that the initial model had only weak effects on the results and that the algorithm was relatively stable (refer to the Supplementary Information).\nAfter the inversion, we obtained velocity structures within 1.5\u00a0km depth below the surface in the WLGF. Fig. 8\n shows horizontal slices of S-wave velocities at depths of 0.26, 0.44, 0.65, 0.84, 1.05, and 1.26\u00a0km, respectively. Fig. 9\n presents vertical transects of the velocity structures (locations of the transects are shown in Fig. 2).\n\nFigs. 8 to 10\n reveal that the velocity structure below the WLGF has the following features:\n1) A NNE-trending low-velocity zone (No. L1) (Fig. 8) is pronounced near the Jixingou fault and vertically extends at least to 1\u00a0km depth;\n2) A distinct NW-trending low-velocity zone (No. L2) traverses the whole goldfield and extends down to a depth of\u00a0>\u00a01.26\u00a0km underneath the surface;\n3) Two low-velocity anomalies (L3 and L4) exist around the western and eastern margin of the Sanguliu pluton, respectively, with both extending to a depth of\u00a0>\u00a01.26\u00a0km below the surface; interestingly, the locations of anomalies L3 and L4 gradually shift to the northeast and north, respectively, with increase of depth.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nInterpretation of the 3D model\nAs mentioned above, the most attractive feature of the shallow crust structure of the WLGF is the existence of several evident low-velocity anomalies (L1-L4; Fig. 8). These low-velocity anomalies may represent different geological features. The L1 anomaly in the central part of the WLGF is generally NNE-trending and is broadly coincident in plan with the area between the NNE-trending Yangjia and 100# faults. Although regional fault zones generally show a low-velocity feature due to faulting leading to lithofraction and fragmentation within them, we interpret the L1 anomaly to be caused mainly by the extensive and intensive hydrothermal alteration (water-bearing minerals) that was likely related to the formation of the Wulong gold deposit, as well as other smaller deposits and occurrences. The reasons for this are two-fold. One reason is that not all of the NNE-trending faults in the goldfield show a low-velocity anomaly feature, indicating that the velocity anomaly can not be attributed only to the faults. At the same time, the L1 and L3 anomalies seem to connect to each other to constitute one single low-velocity anomaly extending along the whole of area between the Yangjia and 100# faults above 400\u00a0m depth below the surface but they are obviously separated below that depth (Fig. 8), similarly suggesting that fault is not the dominant factor generating the L1 anomaly. The other reason is that the largest gold deposit (Wulong) and several other smaller deposits and occurrences in the WLGF occur within the L1 anomaly, with Wulong occupying the center (Fig. 8), implying that strong wallrock alteration might take place within and below the area of the L1 anomaly.\nFor the L2 anomaly, which occurs as a straight NW-trending zone nearly transverse the whole WLGF, we similarly interpret it to result from intense hydrothermal fluid alteration along one or two NW-trending faults. However, there are no such NW-trending faults were observed in the central-western part of the goldfield and there are no lithological interfaces that are in agreement with the L2 anomaly in orientation. Therefore, considering the straight stretching feature of the L2 anomaly, we infer that anomaly L2 represents a buried NW-trending fault, along which the hydrothermal alteration related to the gold mineralization occurred, and thus leading to an evident low-velocity zone. The coincidence of a known NW-trending fault (NWF1) with the northern boundary of the L2 anomaly in the northeastern WLGF (Fig. 8) also supports our suggestion. In addition, previous geophysical studies also identified a NW-trending magnetotelluric and magnetic anomaly that is generally consistent with the L2 low-velocity anomaly and was considered as a buried fault zone (Zhang et al., 2019b). Consequently, we urge that the observed NW-trending L2 low-velocity zone represents one or two NW-trending fault zones that are buried under Cenozoic sediments, in which intense hydrothermal alteration occurred likely during the Early Cretaceous. It is noted that the vertical extent of the L2 anomaly is obviously greater than that of the L1 one. This likely suggests that the buried NW-trending fault and\/or its alteration extent are vertically greater than the NNE-trending ones.\nThe L3 and L4 anomalies are located on the western and eastern margins of the Sanguliu pluton, respectively (Fig. 8). This distribution pattern is generally consistent with that of the lithological variation of the pluton (Figs. 8 and 10). For example, on the eastern and western margins of the Sanguliu pluton, granodiorite and quartz diorite are the main components and exhibit lower shear-wave velocity compared with monzogranite in the central part of the pluton. This can be explained by the higher contents of water-bearing minerals (e.g., hornblende) in the granodiorite and quartz diorite relative to the monzogranite. Additionally, the results of inversion of gravity and magnetic data are consistent with the distribution of velocity in the Sanguliu pluton, that is, the negative gravity and magnetic anomalies in the center are representative of Early Cretaceous granite, while the positive gravity and magnetic anomalies at the two edges of the pluton indicate Early Cretaceous granodiorite (Zhang et al., 2019b). Therefore, we interpret the velocity structure in and around the Sanguliu pluton is likely controlled by lithological differences, with the L3 and L4 anomalies caused by amphibole-bearing dioritic rocks. Some contribution of the hydrothermal alteration associated with the gold mineralization to the L3 and L4 anomalies is also possible because the Sanguliu pluton is genetically related to gold mineralization (Yu et al., 2020a), leading to hydrothermal alteration along its margins, especially when faults exist on the margins (e.g., the Zhengjiapuzi fault is parallel to and cuts through its eastern margin).\nIn a word, the crustal shear-wave velocity structures beneath the WLGF are characterized by several low-velocity anomalies showing different orientations and extents. The L1 and L2 anomalies likely reflect the exposed or concealed regional faults that might have been superimposed by intense hydrothermal alteration accompanying gold mineralization. The L3 and L4 anomalies are ascribed mainly to the difference in lithology of the composite Sanguliu pluton though the contribution of the hydrothermal alteration can not be precluded.\n\n\n4.2\nImplications for exploration potential\nAs aforementioned, the gold mineralization in the WLGF is dominated by the quartz-vein type and the ore-forming fluids are mainly magmatic in origin, with some addition of paleo meteoric water in the late-stage mineralization (Zeng et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020a). The gold deposits were formed in the Early Cretaceous (ca. 125\u2013120\u00a0Ma) and were genetically related to the coeval granitic magmatism generating plutons that are presently either exposed on the surface (e.g., the Sanguliu pluton) or buried underground (Zeng et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020a,b). On the regional\/goldfield scale, the gold deposits as well as occurrences seem to be distributed within or around several regional faults that cut through late Mesozoic granitic intrusions (e.g., Wulong gold deposit) and Precambrian metamorphic rocks of the Liaohe Group (e.g., Sidaogou gold deposit) (Fig. 1c and 2; Yu et al., 2020a). Nevertheless, on a scale of individual gold deposits, the orebodies\/gold-bearing quartz veins are actually hosted directly by the NNE-, NE-, N- and NW-trending secondary-order faults developing beside the regional NNE-trending faults, which is particularly evident at the Wulong deposit (Zeng et al., 2019). Importantly, the 163# gold-bearing quartz vein at the Wulong gold deposit has been confirmed by drilling to extend down to at least 1.4\u00a0km deep below the surface and the gold mineralization is still economically significant at that depth. This suggests that the deep part (at least above 1.4\u00a0km depth) of the goldfield has a high potential for gold metallogeny. In addition, gold mineralization with 2.12\u00a0g\/t Au has been discovered inside the NNE-trending Jixingou Fault zone (Yu et al., 2020b). These indicate that not only the secondary splay faults of the NNE-trending regional faults but also the NNE-trending regional faults themselves are likely the main ore-hosting structures of the gold metallogenic system, showing their high gold potential.\nGenerally, our ambient noise tomography results are in agreement with the essential geological features of the goldfield and corroborate the conclusion of the high gold potential below the WLGF. On the one hand, our ambient noise tomography results reveal the general structural framework that might have controlled the gold mineralization. As discussed in the last subsection, the hydrothermal alteration along the buried NW-trending fault(s) has a larger vertical extent than that along any of the NNE-trending ones, implying that the former probably played a role of the ore-conducting structure of the Wulong gold metallogenic system and the latter the ore-distributing, or ore-hosting, structure. Considering the fact that majority of the gold-bearing quartz veins are directly hosted in the second order fractures beside the regional NNE-trending faults, the final ore-hosting structure, it is evident that the structural configuration is favorable to the gold metallogeny (Liu et al., 2018). On the other hand, our ambient noise tomography results indicate that just a few of faults show low-velocity anomalies, possibly suggesting selective hydrothermal alteration and\/or gold mineralization, meaning that the alteration and gold mineralization has been concentrated in the areas below these faults. Obviously, the deep part of these faults should have high metallogenic potential.\nIn terms of spatial relationship of the gold deposits and the low-velocity anomalies, it is evident that most known gold deposits and occurrences in the WLGF are spatially distributed within the scope of the L1 and L2 low-velocity anomalies (Fig. 8a). Meanwhile, the intersection of the two anomalies is likely the preferred area for gold mineralization, with the majority of gold deposits occurring there, which implies that the intersections of the NNE- and NW-trending regional faults are likely to play a key role in controlling the distribution of the gold deposits. This is specifically true for the Wulong and Sidaogou gold deposits, the two biggest deposits in the goldfield, both of which are located near the fault intersections (Fig. 1c and 8). We urge that there is a large potential exploration space in the deep part of the WLGF. Apart from the deep part of the Wulong gold deposit, where the existence of economic gold mineralization has been attested by drilling, we propose other three potential metallogenic areas for future exploration (Fig. 8a).\nThe first potential area is located about 3\u00a0km southwest of the Wulong gold deposit. The reasons for selecting this area are as below: 1) it belongs to the intersection region of the L1 and L2 low-velocity anomaly zones; 2) it is located in detail at and around the intersection of the NNE-trending Yangjia Fault with the L2 low-velocity anomaly zone; 3) several small-scale gold deposits and occurrences have been delineated on the surface and\/or shallow level of the area; 4) this potential area is located to the northwest of, and not far from, the Early Cretaceous Sanguliu pluton that has a genetic relation to the gold mineralization.\nThe second potential area is located at about 7\u00a0km southeast of the Wulong gold deposit. The favourable conditions for choosing this area mainly include that it is situated around the intersection of the NNE-trending Zhengjiapuzi Fault and the known NW-trending NWF1 that occurs along the northern boundary of the L2 anomaly zone (Fig. 8), and that it is directly located at the contact of the Sanguliu pluton. Additionally, this area is at or around the midpoint of the NWF1 segment between the Wulong and Sidaogou deposits, implying a high possibility of the gold mineralization provided that the equidistant distribution of gold deposits exists in the WLGF, like that recognized in the Linglong goldfield in the Jiaodong Peninsula (Wen et al., 2015).\nThe third potential area is situated around the intersections of the L2 anomaly zone with the two NNE-trending faults in the northwest of the WLGF, (Fig. 8). Selection of this area as a potential one is mainly due to its location within the L2 anomaly and several gold occurrences have been discovered in the area. In addition, although this area is far from the Early Cretaceous Sanguliu pluton and there are no low-velocity anomaly zones along the segments of the two NNE-trending faults outside the L2 anomaly, which seems to be unfavorable for the gold mineralization, the intensity of low-velocity of the area gradually increased with increasing depth compared with the adjacent segments of the L2 anomaly (Fig. 8b). This may indicate another fluid activity and\/or gold mineralization center existing below the area. Meanwhile, it appears that this center gradually migrates to the south with increasing depth. The idea of the existance of the center is consistent with the suggestion that deeply concealed Early Cretaceous plutons might have provided partial ore-forming fluids for the Wulong gold metallogenic system (Zeng et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020b).\nIn summary, the L1 and L2 low-velocity anomalies reflect the hydrothermal alteration and\/or gold mineralization along the NNE- and NW-trending faults and their intersection is the favorable for gold mineralization. The three areas suggested, based on our new ambient noise tomography results as well as published data, for the future exploration are all associated with these anomalies and are located at the intersections of the NNE- and NW-trending faults.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nOur investigation of the Wulong goldfield, Liaodong Peninsula, using ambient noise tomography with a short-period dense array, allows us to reach the following conclusions.\n\n(1)\nThe shallow crustal shear-wave velocity structures beneath the WLGF are characterized by the existence of mainly 4 low-velocity anomalies (L1-L4) of different dimensions and orientations: the L1 anomaly as a wide band extending along the northern part of several NNE-trending faults in the central-northern WLGF; the L2 anomaly as a narrow zone transverse nearly the whole WLGF in a NW direction; and the L3 and L4 anomalies as relatively rounded bodies occurring on the western and eastern margins of the Sanguliu pluton in the central-southern WLGF.\n\n\n(2)\nThe L1 and L2 anomalies are interpreted to be caused by the intense hydrothermal alteration related to the gold mineralization along some NNE- and NW-trending faults, respectively, whereas the L3 and L4 anomalies difference in lithology of the two margins from the central part the Sanguliu pluton, an Early Cretaceous composite intrusion that is considered to be genetically related to the gold mineralization.\n\n\n(3)\nThe L2 anomaly zone, which is interpreted to reflect the existance of one, or two, NW-trending faults concealed by young sediments, has a larger downward extension (>1.4\u00a0km) than that of the L1 anomaly (\u223c1.0\u00a0km), indicating the NW-trending faults played an ore-conducting role and the NNE-trending ones are likely the structures of ore-distributing and\/or ore-hosting for the Wulong gold metallogenic system.\n\n\n(4)\nAccording to the spatial distribution of the known gold deposits\/occurrences and the velocity anomalies, together with the gold metallogenic model, we suggest three favourable potential areas for future exploration, all of which are located at and around the intersections of the NNE- and NW-trending faults and are close to the known (or concealed) Early Cretaceous granite intrusions.\n\n\n(5)\nOur results demonstrate that ambient noise tomography based on the short-period dense array is effective in determining metallogenic structures at orefield scale and has significant potential application to mineral exploration.\n\n\n\n\n","48":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe East Qinling Metallogenic Belt (EQMB) is a significant mineral resource repository of Au, Mo, W, Pb, Zn and Ag in China, with at least 600\u00a0t gold reserves (Fig. 1\nA and 1B; Deng and Wang, 2016; Dong and Santosh, 2016; Li and Pirajno, 2017). The EQMB is composed of four metallogenic clusters, including the Xiaoqinling, Xiaoshan, Luanchuan, and Xiong'ershan districts from the west to the east (Cao et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2019). Located in the central part of the EQMB, the Xiong'ershan district contains various types of gold deposits that were mainly formed during the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous (Fig. 1C; Cao et al., 2017; Chao et al., 2019; Chen and Santosh, 2014; Mao et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2021a). The gold deposits in the Xiong\u2019ershan district include: (1) orogenic lode gold deposits related to the collisional compression and post-collisional extension of the Qinling Orogenic Belt (e.g. Shanggong; Chen et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2019a), (2) porphyry and breccia pipe type gold deposits related to the Early Cretaceous magmatic activity with ore-forming fluid and material sources from deep-seated magma chamber (e.g. Qiyugou; Qi et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2021a; Wang et al., 2021b), and (3) other types of hydrothermal gold deposits hosted in quartz veins and altered rocks filling faults structures (e.g. Yuanling, Hongzhuang, Qianhe; Feng et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). Although some previous studies have suggested that the ore-forming fluids and materials of these hydrothermal gold deposits were derived from granitoid pluton or ore-hosting strata (Chao et al., 2019, 2020; Feng et al., 2021; He, 2017; Hou and Zhang, 2014), the genesis, gold mineralization mechanism and the relationship with the porphyry systems remain equivocal.\nThe Hongzhuang deposit is a typical hydrothermal gold deposit hosted in altered rocks in the Xiong'ershan district. After more than 30\u00a0years of exploitation, the deposit contains 8.9 tons of gold with an average grade of 4.33\u00a0g\/t. Previous studies mainly focused on the geological characteristics and ore-forming fluids, and few studies addressed the metallogenic ages and material sources. The K-Ar isotopic result of K-feldspar in the fracture zone '96234' of the Hongzhuang gold deposit yielded an isochron age of 147\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0Ma (Hou and Zhang, 2014). Due to the excess argon in the experimental process, it was inferred that the mineralization age of the Hongzhuang gold deposit is later than 147\u00a0Ma (Hou and Zhang, 2014; Zhao, 2020). Some previous studies proposed that basement rocks in the Taihua and Xiong'er Groups provided the main ore-forming materials (Hou and Nie, 2006; Hou and Zhang, 2014). Zhao (2020) proposed that the ore-forming materials were mainly sourced from the mantle-derived components and partially melted Taihua and Xiong'er Groups. Fluid inclusion and H-O isotope studies suggested that the early ore-forming fluid was mainly magmatic water, and mixed with meteoric water in the late stage (Li, 2020). In comparison, the Yuanling Au deposit is hosted in quartz veins along fault zones and shows a close spatial relationship with the Hongzhuang deposit in the Shiyaogou ore field. The metallogenic age of the Yuanling deposit has been constrained as 121.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma (Zhao, 2020). The genesis of the two gold deposits and their genetic relationship with the Shiyao porphyry system remain unclear.\nPyrite is the most common sulfide mineral in continental crust and the main component of hydrothermal Au mineralization in the different stages (Ciobanu et al., 2012; Deditius et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2013). Pyrite is also the predominant sulfide mineral in the Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits. The trace element geochemistry of pyrite is an important indicator for monitoring the change of pH, oxidation state and source of ore-forming fluid (Deditius et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014), and the sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite can reveal the source of the fluid and sulfur, as well as the physico-chemical changes in the process of ore precipitation (Cao et al., 2021; Song et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019a; Tanner et al., 2016). In this study, systematic field investigation, microscopic petrographic observation, backscattered electron (BSE) imaging, in situ LA-ICP-MS trace element and sulfur isotopic analysis of pyrite in the Hongzhuang and Yuanling Au deposits were performed. Our results are helpful to elucidate the chemical characteristics of different pyrite generations, source of ore-forming materials and the genetic link of the Hongzhuang and Yuanling deposits with the Shiyaogou porphyry system. The results also provide a direction for gold prospecting at the distal part of the porphyry system in the Xiong\u2019ershan area.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe E-W trending Qinling Orogenic Belt (QOB) is located in the central segment of the Central China Orogenic Belt and formed by multiple stages of subduction-collision between the North China Craton (NCC) and the Yangtze Craton (YC) (Dong and Santosh, 2016; Dong et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2016). The QOB is subdivided into four tectonic domains from north to south by Sanbao Fault, Luanchuan Fault, Shangdan Suture, Mianlue Suture, and Longmenshan Fault, including the Huaxiong block representing the reactivated southern margin of the NCC, the North Qinling orogenic belt, the South Qinling orogenic belt and the northern margin of the YC (Fig. 1B; Chen and Santosh, 2014; Dong et al., 2016).\nThe Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits are located in the southern part of the Xiong\u2019ershan area which belongs to the central part of the Huaxiong Block and is bounded by the Luoning fault to the north and the Machaoying fault to the south (Fig. 1B and 1C). Four lithologic units are exposed in this district, including the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic Taihua Group, the Paleoproterozoic Xiong'er Group, the Mesoproterozoic Guandaokou Group and the Neoproterozoic Luanchuan Group (Fig. 1C). The Taihua Group comprises a suite of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneiss, graphite-bearing gneiss, banded iron formation (BIF), and amphibolite (Huang et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2009). The Xiong'er Group unconformably overlies the Taihua Group and contains a series of low-grade meta-volcanic rocks with eruptive ages of 1.83\u20131.74\u00a0Ga, including basaltic andesite, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite (He et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2004). The Guandaokou and Luanchuan Groups unconformably cover the Xiong\u2019er Group and are composed of marine carbonates and clastic rocks (Tang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2017).\nFaults are widely developed in the Xiong'ershan area, showing NE, WNW, NNE and NW trends. The nearly E-W trending Machaoying fault dips north and was formed by the Mesozoic continental collision (Han et al., 2009). Numerous NE-\/NNE-striking secondary or high-order faults are developed on both sides of the Machaoying fault and control the distribution of Au, Mo, and Pb-Zn deposits in the Xiong\u2019ershan area (Fig. 1C).\nExtensive magmatic activity has been recorded in this region and can be divided into three periods. Intermediate-felsic volcanic rocks in the Xiong'er Group are the products of Paleoproterozoic volcanism (Zhao et al., 2002). The Triassic magmatic activity is represented by the Mogou syenite pluton and Huangshui\u2019an carbonatite (Tang et al., 2019b; Tang et al., 2021b). Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous granitic batholiths and stocks intrude the Taihua and Xiong\u2019er Groups, and are closely related to the Au and Mo mineralization in the Xiong'ershan area, such as the Qiyugou, Shiyaogou and Leimengou intrusions which have emplacement ages of 136\u2013128\u00a0Ma (Hu et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020). Large-scale magmatic-hydrothermal mineralization occurred in the Xiong'ershan area, including porphyry, quartz-vein, and carbonatite-vein type Mo deposits (Chen et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2021b; Tang et al., 2021c), orogenic lode gold deposits (Chen et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2019a), porphyry and breccia pipe type gold deposits (Tang et al., 2021a; Tian et al., 2017), hydrothermal gold deposits hosted in fractures (Chao et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021) and hydrothermal vein type fluorite deposit (Zhao et al., 2020). These deposits are related to distinct tectono-magmatic-hydrothermal events during the Paleoproterozoic, Triassic and Late Mesozoic (Deng et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2021a; Tian et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021a).\n\n\n3\nOre deposit geology\n\n3.1\nHongzhuang gold deposit\nThe Hongzhuang gold deposit is located in the northern part of the Luanchuan County in the Henan Province and contains gold reserves of 8.9 tons with an average grade of 4.33\u00a0g\/t. The Paleoproterozoic Xiong'er Group is widely exposed in the Hongzhuang deposit (Fig. 2\n\nA), consisting of andesite, basaltic andesite, rhyolite porphyry and dacite porphyry. Several EW-, NW-, NS- and NE-trending faults are developed in the mining area, and the EW-trending faults control the distribution of gold-bearing structural alteration zones (e.g. No. 96234, 98201, 98202 and 98203 orebodies; Fig. 2).\nThe gold orebodies are mainly distributed in the structural alteration zones, among which the orebody of No. 96234 alteration zone is the largest and has the highest grade of gold. The exposed length of No. 96234 orebody is about 7\u00a0km, striking 270\u00b0-280\u00b0 and dipping 50\u00b0-80\u00b0 to the north. It contains 4 large gold orebodies and more than 10 small gold orebodies, which occur as layer, vein and lenticular shapes in the structural alteration zone (Fig. 2B). The main orebody shows an average grade of 7.98\u00a0g\/t gold, a maximum length of 1090\u00a0m and an average thickness of 1.57\u00a0m. The metallic minerals of the deposit include native gold, pyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite (Fig. 4\n), the gangue minerals are dominantly quartz, calcite, sericite, chlorite and fluorite. The alteration types include silicification, K-feldspathization, chloritization, sericitization and carbonation.\nAccording to the crosscutting relationship, alteration characteristics and paragenetic sequences, the ore-forming process of the Hongzhuang deposit can be divided into quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite stage (stage I), quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfides stage (stage II) and quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate stage (stage III). Stage I is characterized by milky quartz and small amount of idiomorphic coarse-grained pyrite, with strong silicification (Fig. 5\na). The major gold mineralization occurs in stage II and is characterized by the intergrowth of smoky quartz and polymetallic sulfides (Fig. 5b). Stage III is characterized by a mineral assemblage of quartz and calcite, with minor amount of fluorite (Fig. 5c).\n\n\n3.2\nYuanling gold deposit\nThe Yuanling gold deposit is located in the western part of the Hongzhuang gold deposit, with 3.25 tons of gold and an average grade of 6.57\u00a0g\/t. The Xiong'er Group in the mining area is composed of andesite, dacite porphyry, rhyolite and trachyandesite. The gold orebodies are controlled by the EW-trending F1 fault and NE-trending F2 fault (Fig. 3A).\nThe economic orebodies in the Yuanling gold deposit include the No. 980 and No. 986 veins. The No. 980 auriferous vein has a total length of 1126\u00a0m and a width of 0.1\u20132.14\u00a0m, and occurs as vein and lenticular in shape (Fig. 3B and 3C). The No. 986 orebody is controlled by the F2 fault and is approximately 100\u00a0m in length and 0.5 to 2.4\u00a0m in thickness. The main metallic minerals are native gold, pyrite and galena, and the gangue minerals include quartz, calcite and fluorite (Fig. 4). Hydrothermal alterations are common and include silicification, sericitization, K-feldspathization, carbonation, followed by chloritization, and kaolinization. Based on the crosscutting relationship, alteration type and mineral assemblage, the hydrothermal mineralization processes can be divided into quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite stage (stage I), quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfides stage (stage II) and quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate stage (stage III). Stage I is featured by milky quartz and coarse-grained pyrite (Fig. 5d), and accompanied by sericitization and chloritization. The stage II mineralization mainly forms smoky quartz and polymetallic sulfides (Fig. 5e), including medium- to fine-grained pyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Stage III is characterized by the appearance of quartz\u00a0+\u00a0calcite veins (Fig. 5f), with a small amount of poorly crystallized fluorite.\n\n\n\n4\nSamples and pyrite types\nIn this study, two sets of representative samples were collected from the Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits, covering the three stages of mineralization, respectively. A total of 32 samples were collected from the Hongzhuang gold deposit, including 6 samples from quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite veins (Stage I), 20 samples from quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfide veins (Stage II) and 6 samples from quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate veins (Stage III). Forty-two samples were collected from the Yuanling gold deposit, among which 20 samples were from quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite veins (stage I), 16 samples from quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfide veins (Stage II), and 6 samples from quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate veins (Stage III). Polished thick and thin sections from these samples were prepared for detailed microscopic observations, to characterize the texture and occurrence of different pyrite generations. After a detailed petrographic study, six representative samples from the Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits were selected for LA-ICP-MS in-situ trace elements and sulfur isotope analysis, including HZ-3 and YL-9 from stage I, HZ-34 and YL-35 from stage II, HZ-C1 and YL-35.1 from stage III.\nPyrite is a common sulfide mineral in different mineralization stages of the Hongzhuang and Yuanling Au deposits. Six types of pyrite were identified in the two gold deposits through petrographic observations of polished sections, including HZ-Py1 and YL-Py1 from stage I, HZ-Py2 and YL-Py2 from stage II, HZ-Py3 and YL-Py3 from stage III. In the Hongzhuang deposit, the first type (HZ-Py1) is represented by coarse-grained cubic pyrite (>500\u00a0\u03bcm) with a rough surface and is generally co-genetic with milky quartz in stage I vein (Fig. 6\na, b). The second type (HZ-Py2) is characterized by medium- to fine-grained pyrites (50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm) which intergrow with polymetallic sulfides of stage II (Fig. 6d). The third type (HZ-Py3) forms coarse-grained idiomorphic pyrite with the size of 1\u20132\u00a0mm in stage III quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate vein (Fig. 6e). The classification of pyrite types in the Yuanling deposit is similar to that in the Hongzhuang deposit. The first type (YL-Py1) is composed of coarse-grained idiomorphic cubic pyrite (1\u20132\u00a0mm), occurring in stage I quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite vein (Fig. 6f, g). The second type (YL-Py2) is characterized by medium- to fine-grained subhedral pyrite with the size of 50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm in the quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfides vein (Fig. 6h). The third type (YL-Py3) is represented by irregular pyrite (50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm) and is associated with calcite in stage III quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate vein (Fig. 6i).\n\n\n5\nAnalytical methods\nThe domains with representative pyrites were cut and cast in a 25\u00a0mm diameter epoxy disc together with standard Sierra for LA-ICP-MS and SIMS analyses. Both sample bases are polished to show the center of grains and get a flat surface. The sample and the standard mounting block were coated with 30\u00a0nm high pure gold and carefully placed into the holder to set the surface of the block at the same level. Standard blocks (cast separately to be reused) were made by mounting 1 to 2-grain fragments of pyrite.\nThe analytical instruments for pyrite trace element analysis included a Resonetics S-155-LR 193\u00a0nm excimer laser ablation system connected to the Agilent 7700X Quadrupole ICPMS, located at the Geological History Facility (GHF) of the John Drayte Centre at Curtin University, Perth, Australia. The methodology was same with those described in Wang et al. (2017). The analytical time of each sample consisted of 30\u00a0s of background analysis and 45\u00a0s of sample analysis. The laser instrument uses a beam of 50\u201375\u00a0\u03bcm, a laser injection rate of 16\u20132.5\u00a0J\/cm2, and a laser repetition rate of 7\u00a0Hz. Oxide polyatomic interferences were minimized by tuning flow rates for a ThO\/Th of\u00a0<\u00a00.5%. Ultra-high purity He (0.68 L min\u22121) and N2 were used to wash the sample cells (2.8\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u22121) and high purity argon was used as plasma carrier gas. The international glass standard GDD-1G was used as the main standard material, and the stoichiometric quantity 57Fe was used as the internal standard element to calculate the element concentration, and the drift of the instrument was corrected. Standard blocks were run every 10 unknowns. After repeated analysis with BCR-2G (GeoReM: http:\/\/georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de\/), the precision of most elements was better than 5%. A total of 24 elements were analyzed, including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Ba, Gd, W, Au, Pb, Bi.\nIn situ sulfur isotope analysis was performed on the CAMECA IMS1280 Large geometric Ion Microprobe (SIMS) microscope, Characterization and Division (CMCA), University of Western Australia (UWA). The analytical setting and conditions, data processing and error propagation for pyrite applications followed the methods described by LaFlamme et al. (2016) and Wang et al. (2017). The instrument mass fractionation was calibrated by the use of matrix-matched standard Serra pyrite (\u03b433S\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u2030 and \u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a02.17\u2030; LaFlamme et al., 2016; LaFlamme et al., 2018). The 2\u03c3 uncertainty of \u03b434S is 0.18\u2030, and that of \u03b433S is 0.19\u2030, based on repeated measurements of the internal reference substance Sierra during the analyses.\n\n\n6\nResult\n\n6.1\nTrace element composition of pyrite\nA total of 86 LA-ICP-MS spot analyses were conducted on the six types of pyrite from Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits, including 18 data of HZ-Py1, 14 data of HZ-Py2, 13 data of HZ-Py3, 10 data of YL-Py1, 20 data of YL-Py2 and 11 data of YL-Py3. The mean and range values for these elements are presented in Table 1\n, and the detailed data sets are available in Supplementary Table 1.\nThe contents of Au in the three pyrite types of the Hongzhuang deposit are 0.510\u201325.0\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a06.12\u00a0ppm), 1.02\u201347.0\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a08.23\u00a0ppm) and 3.20\u201325.0\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a09.16\u00a0ppm), respectively. The Au concentrations show an increasing trend from HZ-Py1, HZ-Py2 to HZ-Py3. However, the silver contents display the opposite pattern to that of gold, showing a decreasing trend from HZ-Py1 (0.018\u2013193\u00a0ppm, mean\u00a0=\u00a016.1\u00a0ppm), HZ-Py2 (0.149\u20131.31\u00a0ppm, mean\u00a0=\u00a00.567\u00a0ppm) to HZ-Py3 (0.011\u20130.075\u00a0ppm, mean\u00a0=\u00a00.034\u00a0ppm). The concentrations of Ti, Co, Ni and As are highly variable in pyrite (Table 1), the ranges of Ti contents in HZ-Py1, HZ-Py2 and HZ-Py3 are 36.6 to 197.2\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a057.5\u00a0ppm), 47.9 to 2810\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a0565\u00a0ppm) and 3.29 to 76.1\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a053.9\u00a0ppm), respectively. The As contents range in 1.06\u2013562\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a099.6\u00a0ppm), 3.46\u2013273\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a034.0\u00a0ppm) and 1.30\u201310.3\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a02.89\u00a0ppm), respectively. Notably, HZ-Py1 has the highest contents of As and the lowest content of Ni, HZ-Py2 contains the highest concentrations of Ti, Co and Ni, whereas HZ-Py3 has the lowest concentrations of Ti, Co and As (Figs. 7 and 8\n\n). In addition, HZ-Py2 has the highest Cr, Cu, Zn, Sb, Te, Pb and Bi contents, but the lowest Se contents compared to HZ-Py1 and HZ-Py3. The content of the Se is generally comparable between HZ-Py1 (mean\u00a0=\u00a07.84\u00a0ppm) and HZ-Py3 (mean\u00a0=\u00a08.34\u00a0ppm).\nThe three types of pyrite (YL-Py1, YL-Py2 and YL-Py3) from the Yuanling gold deposit show a decreasing trend of Ti (285\u00a0ppm; 23.2\u00a0ppm; 4.65\u00a0ppm), Co (140\u00a0ppm; 85.1\u00a0ppm; 0.161\u00a0ppm), Ag (3.94\u00a0ppm; 1.01\u00a0ppm; 0.817\u00a0ppm) and Pb (287\u00a0ppm; 177\u00a0ppm; 6.50\u00a0ppm) contents. However, the variations of Ni (3.35\u00a0ppm; 5.28\u00a0ppm; 95.7\u00a0ppm), Se (1.67\u00a0ppm; 1.87\u00a0ppm; 6.22\u00a0ppm) and Bi (0.332\u00a0ppm; 0.509\u00a0ppm; 55.2\u00a0ppm) contents show the opposite patterns with an increasing trend from YL-Py1, YL-Py2 to YL-Py3. Apart from these trace elements, the concentrations of Zn and Bi are highly variable in these pyrites (Table 1). The ranges of Zn contents in YL-Py1, YL-Py2 and YL-Py3 are 0.191 to 710\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a092.1\u00a0ppm), 0.163 to 1200\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a0198\u00a0ppm) and 0.065 to 193\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a017.7\u00a0ppm), respectively. The corresponding ranges of Bi contents are 0.031 to 1.21\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.332\u00a0ppm), 0.009 to 1.56\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.509\u00a0ppm), and 0.633 to 440\u00a0ppm (mean\u00a0=\u00a055.2\u00a0ppm), respectively. The YL-Py2 has the highest As (15.0\u00a0ppm), Mo (39.3\u00a0ppm) and Sb (3.85\u00a0ppm) contents, but the lowest Cu (3.17\u00a0ppm) and Te (5.82\u00a0ppm) contents compared to YL-Py1 and YL-Py3 (Figs. 7 and 8).\n\n\n6.2\nSulfur isotope characteristics\nThe complete sulfur isotopic dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a044) is provided in Supplementary Table 2, including 9 spots of HZ-Py1, 6 spots of HZ-Py2 and 11 spots of HZ-Py3 from the Hongzhuang deposit, and 4 spots of YL-Py1, 5 spots of YL-Py2 and 9 spots of YL-Py3 from the Yuanling deposit. The \u03b434S values of the three pyrite generations from the Hongzhuang deposit range from 3.92\u2030 to 6.43\u2030, among which the values range from 4.37\u2030 to 6.43\u2030 (mean\u00a0=\u00a05.48\u2030) for HZ-Py1, from 5.46\u2030 to 6.03\u2030 (mean\u00a0=\u00a05.69\u2030) for HZ-Py2 and from 3.92\u2030 to 5.20\u2030 (mean\u00a0=\u00a04.41\u2030) for HZ-Py3. The range of \u03b434S values from the Yuanling deposit is 2.82\u2030 to 4.46\u2030, among which the \u03b434S values range from 2.84\u2030 to 4.38\u2030 (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.32\u2030) for YL-Py1, from 2.86\u2030 to 4.46\u2030 (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.72\u2030) for YL-Py2 and from 2.82\u2030 to 4.30\u2030 (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.47\u2030) for YL-Py3.\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nTrace element characteristics of pyrite\nPrevious studies have indicated that trace elements in pyrite occur in the following forms: (1) as structurally bound elements within the crystal lattice (Deditius et al., 2014; Reich et al., 2013); (2) as invisible nanoparticles of sulfides (Ciobanu et al., 2012); (3) as micro- to nano-sized mineral inclusions (Deditius et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2011). According to the analytical results of this study, the different distribution of trace element composition leads to the diversity of pyrite compositions.\nThe siderophile and chalcophile elements, including Co, Ni, As, Se and Te, are commonly distributed in pyrite as structurally bound elements. Cobalt and nickle enter the crystal structure of pyrite by substituting Fe in form of isomorphism, and are not released during the recrystallization of hydrothermal pyrite, whereas As, Se and Te enter the lattice via replacing S (Campbell and Ethier, 1984; Koglin et al., 2010; Large et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014). In the LA-ICP-MS time-resolved depth profiles, the signal curves of Co, Ni, As, Se and Te are generally stable and approximate to Fe (Fig. 9\n), which confirm that these elements enter the different types of pyrite via isomorphism.\nThe metallogenetic elements mainly include Au, Pb, Zn, Cu and a small amount of Ag. Gold occurs in pyrite as visible native Au and invisible Au. As shown in Fig. 10\nb, the Au concentrations in pyrite plot below the solubility saturation line where Au occurs as structurally bound element within the crystal lattice, in contrast to nanoparticles of native Au above the line (Li et al., 2019a; Reich et al., 2005). In addition, the LA-ICP-MS time-resolved depth profiles show a multi-peak Au signal curve, indicating that Au occurs as invisible nanoparticles or nanosized inclusions in pyrite (Fig. 9). Arsenic, Te, Se and Sb lead to structural deformation and size reduction of pyrite particles by replacing the position of S in pyrite structure or lattice, i.e. the increase of the surface\/volume ratio, thus increasing the incorporation of invisible Au (Agangi et al., 2014; Deditius et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2018). However, there is no correlation between the concentrations of Au versus As, Te, Se and Sb (Fig. 10a, d-f). Therefore, we propose that the incorporation of invisible Au in pyrite is through absorption-chemisorption of invisible nanoparticles during the growth or as nanosized Au-bearing mineral inclusions, rather than as the solid solution (Ciobanu et al., 2012). Gold and silver show a relatively good correlation in HZ-Py1 and YL-Py2 (Fig. 10c), suggesting that part of the Au and Ag exist in the form of electrum, which is also confirmed by the LA-ICP-MS time-resolved depth profiles where the signals of Au and Ag have synchronous peaks (Fig. 9a, c). The signals of Ag, Sb, Bi and Pb show the approximate peak distribution (Fig. 9c, f), in combination with their well-correlated element concentrations in HZ-Py2 and YL-Py3 (Fig. 11\na-e), implying that silver, galena, sphalerite and Sb- or Bi-compounds (e.g. argyrythrose, matildite) occur as nanoparticles and micro to nanosized mineral inclusions in pyrite. The signal of Cu shows multiple peaks in HZ-Py2 (Fig. 9c), in combination with the varied concentrations over two orders of magnitudes (Table 1), indicating that it occurs as chalcopyrite inclusions.\n\n\n7.2\nSource of ore-forming materials\nThe sulfur isotopic composition of sulfide minerals and \u03a3\u03b434S value of the ore-forming fluid have implication for the source of ore-forming materials, sulfur isotopic fractionation and the related physico-chemical conditions (Ohmoto, 1972, 1986). The \u03b434S values of the three types of pyrite (HZ-Py1\u00a0=\u00a04.37\u2030 to 6.43\u2030, HZ-Py2\u00a0=\u00a05.46\u2030 to 6.03\u2030 and HZ-Py3\u00a0=\u00a03.92\u2030 to 5.20\u2030) from the Hongzhuang deposit and the three generations of pyrite (YL-Py1\u00a0=\u00a02.84\u2030 to 4.38\u2030, YL-Py2\u00a0=\u00a02.86\u2030 to 4.46\u2030 and YL-Py3\u00a0=\u00a02.82\u2030 to 4.30\u2030) from the Yuanling deposit are slightly higher than the \u03b434S values of the mantle (Fig. 12\n; Chaussidon and Lorand, 1990). Notably, the sulfur isotopic data are roughly within the range of the Huashan pluton (1.8\u2030 \u2212 6.6\u2030; Fan et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2010), Taihua Group (1.3\u2030 \u2212 5.7\u2030; Chen et al., 2004; Fan et al., 1994) and Xiong'er Group (2.5\u2030 \u2212 5.4\u2030; Chen et al., 2004). However, the \u03b434S values of the two deposits do not overlap with those of the Guandaokou and Luanchuan Groups, indicating that biogenic sulfur from the subducted marine sediments did not participate in mineralization. Extensive fluid-rock interaction with the host rock Xiong\u2019er Group during the mineralization process can lead to the mixed sources of sulfur and other materials from the wall rock. The gold ore bodies of the Hongzhuang deposit occur in the compressional fracture zone and show a strong fluid-rock interaction with the ferrous iron-rich andesites in the Xiong'er Group, resulting in the decrease of the \u03b434S values (5.48\u2030 to 4.41\u2030) from HZ-Py1 to HZ-Py3. During the fluid-rock interaction, the SO4\n2- is continuously reduced to H2S by the Fe2+ in the andesites of the Xiong\u2019er Group, the 32S-O bond was broken more easily than the 34S-O bond, resulting in the enrichment of 32S and the decrease of \u03b434S value (Ohmoto, 1986). On the contrary, the ore bodies in the Yuanling deposit are represented by quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite veins in extensional faults, and show weaker fluid-rock interaction, leading to the constant \u03b434S values around 3.5\u2030 in different pyrite generations. The sulfur isotopic results indicate that the material sources of the Hongzhuang deposit involved more contributions of the wall rock Xiong'er Group than those in the Yuanling deposit.\nNickel can easily enter into pyrite lattice in the form of isomorphism and is not readily released even during the recrystallization of hydrothermal pyrite (Huerta-Diaz and Morse, 1992; Koglin et al., 2010; Luther, 1998; Tribovillard et al., 2006). Therefore, the content of Ni in pyrite can provide information for the source of ore-forming fluid (Zhao et al., 2011). The concentration of Ni is strongly enriched in ultramafic and mafic rocks, such as the mean Ni concentration of mantle-derived rock is 2200\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0500\u00a0ppm (Palme and O'Neill, 2003) which is obviously higher than those in felsic rocks. The Ni contents in the upper continental crust range from 19 to 60\u00a0ppm (Rudnick et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2015), thus the Ni content of pyrite associated with post-granitic hydrothermal fluid is rather low. The nickel contents in the pyrites of the Hongzhuang deposit are 0.052\u2013300\u00a0ppm (average 71.4\u00a0ppm), and those of the Yuanling deposit are 0.027\u2013489\u00a0ppm (average 29.7\u00a0ppm), which show affinity with felsic rocks. In addition, the contents of compatible elements Cr (<10\u00a0ppm) and V (<5 ppm) in different pyrite generations are also low, indicating that the ore-forming fluids and materials could not have been directly derived from the mantle and are probably related to the late Mesozoic granites in the region. The Early Cretaceous granitic magma of the Shiyaogou, Qiyugou, Leimengou and Huashan plutons were mainly sourced from the mixed components of the mantle and partial melted lower crust (Han et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2021). Previous fluid inclusion and stable isotope (C, H, O) data also indicated that the hydrothermal mineralization of the Hongzhuang and Yuanling deposits were resulted from post-magmatic fluids (Li, 2020; Zhao, 2020). Therefore, we propose that gold and other ore-forming materials in the Hongzhuang and Yuanling deposits were mainly related to the Late Mesozoic granitic magmatism with significant contribution of mantle-derived components.\n\n\n7.3\nGenesis of the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits and link with the Shiyaogou porphyry system\nTrace element chemistry of pyrite (especially Co\/Ni ratio) has been widely used to characterize the origin of pyrite and to elucidate the origin of hydrothermal deposits (Bralia et al., 1979; Brill, 1989; Reich et al., 2016). The Co\/Ni ratios < 1 (with a typical value of 0.63) are generally considered to be the characteristic of sedimentary pyrite. In contrast, the Co\/Ni ratio of hydrothermal pyrite is highly variable and is typical\u00a0>\u00a01 (Brill, 1989; Price, 1972). The Co\/Ni ratios of pyrites from the Hongzhuang deposit are\u00a0>\u00a01 (Fig. 11f), indicating hydrothermal origin. The Co\/Ni ratios of YL-Py1 and YL-Py2 in the Yuanling deposit are\u00a0>\u00a01, but the ratios of YL-Py3 are\u00a0<\u00a01 (Fig. 11f), indicating that the late stage pyrite may be affected by the mixture with meteoric water which introduces the material from sedimentary rocks. The Co\/Ni ratios also indicate that the precipitation temperature of pyrite with higher values in high-temperature conditions (Sheng and Fan, 1999). The Co\/Ni values of pyrite in different stages of the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits show a decreasing trend from Py1 to Py3, respectively, indicating that the temperature decreases gradually during the mineralization process. The available fluid inclusions and H-O isotope data also support the decreasing of temperature and the incorporation of meteoric water in the late stage (Hou and Zhang, 2014; Li, 2020).\nThe Hongzhuang and Yuanling gold deposits show a close spatial relationship and are closely related to the porphyry pluton in the Shiyaogou ore field (Fig. 1C). The K-Ar isotopic data of K-feldspar in the fracture zone '96234' of the Hongzhuang deposit yielded isochron age of 147\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0Ma (Hou and Zhang, 2014). The mineralization age of the Hongzhuang deposit was considered to be later than 147\u00a0Ma due to the excess argon in the experimental process (Zhao, 2020). Zhao (2020) reported the pyrite Rb-Sr isochron age of 121\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Ma, which was proposed to represent the metallogenic age of the Yuanling deposit. In comparison, LA-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb dating showed that the Shiyaogou pluton was emplaced at 135\u2013132\u00a0Ma (Han et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2021). The available geochemical data and Hf isotope data indicated that the Shiyaogou granite porphyry was mainly derived from the mixed source of partial melted lower crust and mantle-derived components (Zhang et al., 2021). In combination with the ore-forming materials of the two gold deposits which were mainly correlated with the Late Mesozoic granitic magmatism with significant contribution of mantle-derived components, we propose that the Au mineralization in the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits is the distal product of the Shiyaogou porphyry system. The Shiyaogou pluton was emplaced during 135\u2013132\u00a0Ma, and Mo mineralization occurred at 132.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2021). The subsequent post-magmatic hydrothermal fluids migrated along fractures, and generated different degrees of fluid-rock interaction with the ferrous iron-rich andesites in Xiong\u2019er Group, leading to the precipitation of auriferous pyrite in the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits.\nTherefore, the metallogenic model of the Shiyaogou porphyry system is proposed as follows. The voluminous magmatic activities were generated from the Early Cretaceous lithospheric thinning in eastern China (Deng et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019b; Mao et al., 2010; Yang and Santosh, 2020). The asthenospheric upwelling led to partial melting of the lower crust, introducing the Au and other ore-forming materials into the Shiyaogou magmatic-hydrothermal system. After that, the post-magmatic hydrothermal fluids migrated along the EW-trending faults and the NE-trending secondary faults, resulting in the extensive fluid-rock interaction, temperature decreasing and hydrothermal gold mineralization in the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits (Fig. 13\n).\n\n\n\n8\nConclusion\n\n\n\n(1)\nThree types of pyrite are identified from each deposit, including coarse-grained cubic pyrite (HZ-Py1) in stage I milky quartz vein, medium- to fine-grained pyrite (HZ-Py2) in stage II polymetallic sulfide veins and irregular coarse-grained pyrite (HZ-Py3) in stage III quartz-calcite vein from the Hongzhuang deposit, coarse-grained idiomorphic cubic pyrite (YL-Py1) in stage I quartz vein, medium- to fine-grained pyrite (YL-Py2) in the polymetallic sulfide veins and co-genetic pyrite with calcite (YL-Py3) in stage III vein from the Yuanling deposit.\n\n\n(2)\nLA-ICPMS analysis shows that gold in pyrite from the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits mainly occurs as visible native Au and invisible nanoparticles or nanosized inclusions. Co, Ni, As, Se and Te replace Fe and S in pyrite in the form of isomorphism, whereas Ag, Pb and Cu are distributed primarily as invisible or visible sulfide inclusions.\n\n\n(3)\nThe \u03b434S values of the Hongzhuang and Yuanling Au deposits range from 3.92\u2030 to 6.43\u2030 and 2.82\u2030 to 4.46\u2030, respectively. Sulfur and other ore-forming materials were mainly related to the Late Mesozoic granitic magmatism with significant contribution of mantle-derived components, and the material source of the Hongzhuang deposit is more influenced by the wall rock Xiong'er group than the Yuanling deposit.\n\n\n(4)\nThe Hongzhuang-Yuanling Au deposits and the Shiyaogou pluton are genetically linked with consistent source materials, and we propose that the Au mineralization in the Hongzhuang-Yuanling deposits is distal product of the Shiyaogou porphyry system.\n\n\n\n\n","49":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Western Hunan-Eastern Guizhou (WHEG) Pb-Zn metallogenic belt is located in the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block in South China and is bounded by the Jiangnan Orogenic belt to the southeast (Fig. 1\na) (Li, 2018; Wei et al., 2020). This belt contains \u223c300 Pb-Zn deposits with a total endowment of >20\u00a0Mt of Pb and Zn reserves, including the world-class Huayuan, Niujiaotang, and Danaopo deposits (Ye et al., 2012; Duan et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2021). This belt also hosts numerous Ag, Au, Hg, and Sb deposits (Chen et al., 2006), and significant resource endowments of Cd, Ga, and Ge, all of which make it an attractive target for future mineral exploration (Zhou et al., 2020).\nThe Pb-Zn deposits in the WHEG metallogenic belt are generally hosted by the Ediacaran-Devonian carbonate rocks (Tang et al., 2012, Li et al., 2013). These deposits are characterized by: i) low ore grades (average 4\u00a0wt% Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn); ii) critical metal enrichments (e.g., Cd, Ga, and Ge); iii) stratabound, veined, and lenticular orebodies jointly controlled by faults and lithological boundaries; iv) low temperatures (140\u00a0\u00b0C-220\u00a0\u00b0C) and moderate salinities (11.0\u201319.0\u00a0wt% NaCl equivalent) mineralizing fluids; and v) mostly positive sulfur and radiogenic crustal Pb isotopic compositions (Duan et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2020). Although many studies have focused on the mineralization within this belt, the nature of the mineralizing fluids and the process involved in the precipitation of hydrothermal minerals remain poorly constrained. In addition, previous studies have focused mainly on the Ediacaran-Cambrian carbonate-hosted Cd-rich Zn deposits (Ye et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018).\nMining of the Devonian carbonate-hosted Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit began in 2000 (Chen et al., 2006), and reserves for the deposit published in 2020 indicate that it contains 7.7 million tons (Mt) at 5.1% Zn and 110\u00a0ppm Ge, with significant potential for expansion (Zhou et al., 2020). The deposit consists of stratabound-like orebodies, which led Chen et al. (2006) to suggest that the deposit formed syn-genetically during the Devonian. Other research suggests that the deposit formed as a result of sedimentary reworking (Zuo, 2013). As such, the origin of the Banbianjie deposit remains unclear.\nHydrothermal dolomite is present throughout the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit and is closely associated with sulfide minerals. Trace elemental compositions of hydrothermal dolomite have often been used to understand the source and evolution of ore-forming fluids (Bau et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2016a; Luo et al., 2019). In addition, C-O-S-Pb isotopes have been successfully utilized to constrain the source of ore-forming elements, the processes involved in ore formation, the thermal evolution of mineralizing systems, and water\u2013rock (W\/R) interaction (e.g., Ohmoto, 1972; Zheng, 1990; Lottermoser, 1992; de Oliveira et al., 2019). Here we present geological, mineralogical, and geochemical (in-situ trace elements and C-O-S-Pb isotopes) data for the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit and use these data to outline the origin and evolution of the hydrothermal fluids that formed this deposit. These data also allow the development of a genetic model for the deposit that can be used to guide exploration elsewhere in the WHEG Pb-Zn metallogenic belt and other similar geological setting regions worldwide.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe WHEG Pb-Zn metallogenic belt is located at the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block (Fig. 1a; Chen et al., 2006). The regional stratigraphy comprises a metamorphosed basement and overlying sedimentary cover (Gao et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2017; Zhou and Li, 2021). The oldest unit in the sedimentary cover is the Upper Proterozoic Banxi Group, which comprises low-grade metamorphosed sandstone and slate with minor amounts of carbonate rocks (Wu et al., 2022). No Middle-Upper Silurian strata are preserved in the area, but a Paleozoic-Quaternary sedimentary sequence consisting of carbonate rocks, muddy sandstones, and shale is exposed, containing no igneous rocks. These strata include Lower-Middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician carbonate platform sequences that are the main hosts of the sulfide mineralization in this area (Li, 1991; Yang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016b; Wang et al., 2018).\nThe tectonic evolution of the WHEG Pb-Zn metallogenic belt includes a Neoproterozoic regional metamorphic event that generated the metamorphic basement (Zhao et al., 2011). Subsequent transgressive events formed passive continental marginal basins that led to the deposition of thick sequences of marine carbonates (Xu et al., 2010). A subsequent regression led to the lack of Middle-upper Silurian and Lower Devonian strata, with the deposition of Middle-Upper Devonian restricted carbonate platform sedimentary rocks recording another transgressive event. This was followed by Caledonian compression and the subsequent development of a series of E-W- and N-S-trending extensional and strike-slip faults (Dai, 2010; Li, 2018), all of which acted as conduits for mineralizing hydrothermal fluids.\nThe southwestern WHEG Pb-Zn belt includes the Southern Guizhou Depression, which is bounded by many NE-SW- to E-W-trending crustal-scale faults, including the NE-SW-trending Mandong and E-W-trending Huangsi faults (Fig. 1b). This region also contains the N-S-oriented Huangsi and Wangsi anticlines. The Yanshanian E-W compression generated Jura-type folds with wide anticlines and closed synclines (Wang, 1991). These faults and folds are genetically related to the formation of Pb, Zn, and other polymetallic deposits in this region, including the Niujiaotang, Banbianjie, Zhulingou, and Jiangzhou deposits (Fig. 1b; Chen et al., 2006; Ye et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2020).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\n\n3.1\nSedimentary strata and tectonic setting\nThe Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit is located in the northwestern Southern Guizhou Depression close to the E-W-trending Huangsi fault (Fig. 1b). Ore bodies are hosted mainly by fine-grained dolostone of the Upper Devonian Gaopochang Formation. The main strata exposed in the study area, from top to bottom, are the Lower Carboniferous Xiangbai Formation, consisting mainly of quartz sandstone and mudstone; the Upper Devonian Zhewang Formation, comprising micritic limestone and dolostone; the Upper Devonian Yaosuo Formation, consisting mainly of dolostone; the Upper Devonian Gaopochang Formation, which is composed of bioclastic fine-grained dolostone; the Upper Devonian Mangshan Formation, which is composed mainly of fine-grained quartz sandstone; and Silurian-Ordovician calcareous sandstones (Fig. 2\n).\nThe Ge-Zn mineralization in the Banbianjie deposit is controlled by secondary structures associated with the Early Paleozoic E-W trending Huangsi fault and the northwestern limb of the Huangsi anticline (Fig. 2; Chen et al., 2006). The Huangsi fault is arcuate, centrally concave, and splits into a secondary NW-SE-trending fault that dips to the south at angles of 40\u00b0\u201370\u00b0. The fault is associated with angular-subangular fault breccias and peripheral alteration, including pyrite and bitumen alteration, indicating that this fault is closely associated with the formation of the mineralization in this area.\n\n\n3.2\nOrebodies\nThe two main orebodies (I and II) in the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit have widths of 3\u201310\u00a0m and lengths of 750\u00a0m and 520\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 2). The No. I orebody is located at the base of the mineralized sedimentary rocks, whereas the No. II orebody is located within the middle-upper section of these strata. The mineralization within the Gaopochang Formation is strata-bound, lenticular, or present as bedding-parallel veins and trends NW-SE, dipping at 5\u00b0-18\u00b0 (Figs. 2 and 3\na, b). The No. II orebody is the largest known orebody in the study area and contains >80% of the total Zn reserves in the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit. The Zn metal grades range from 2.4 to 15.6\u00a0wt%, with accompanying average Ge contents as high as 110\u00a0ppm (Zhou et al., 2020). The No. I orebody is closer to the Huangsi fault than the No. II orebody. The strata-bound and lenticular orebodies have sharp boundaries with the surrounding fine-grained dolostone of the Devonian Gaopochang Formation (Fig. 3a), and veined mineralization commonly occurs along faults or surrounds wall rock lenses (Fig. 3b, c).\n\n\n3.3\nMineralogy and mineral paragenesis\nThe Banbianjie deposit contains sulfide mineralization with only minor oxide minerals. Sulifide ores are dominated by sphalerite, pyrite, and marcasite with minor amounts of galena, all of which are associated with a hydrothermal dolomite gangue assemblage containing minor amounts of calcite (Figs. 3 and 4\n). The mineralization is massive (Fig. 3d), vein-hosted (Fig. 3e), banded (Fig. 3f), brecciated (Fig. 3g, h), and disseminated (Fig. 3i). Massive mineralization consists of aggregates of fine-grained pyrite, marcasite, and sphalerite (Fig. 3d), whereas the veined mineralization often cements hydraulic breccias within the hosting dolomite (Fig. 3e). Banded sulfide mineralization contains vein-hosted aggregates of sphalerite that define bands with alternating pyrite veinlets. The brecciated mineralization consists of sulfide and dolomite fragments enclosed by wall rocks (Fig. 3f, g, h), whereas the disseminated mineralization consists of sulfides irregularly distributed within wall rocks (Fig. 3i).\nOre textures are commonly colloform (Fig. 4a\u2013c), fibrous (Fig. 4d), granular (Fig. 4e), dendritic (metasomatic, Fig. 4f, g), acicular (Fig. 4h, i), and present as veined aggregates (Fig. 4j, k). Sphalerite occurs as fibrous-radiated aggregates with reddish-brown to brown fibers oriented perpendicular to banding and coarsening toward the peripheries of grains (Fig. 4d), or as dendritic crystals coexisting with pyrite and dolomite (Fig. 4f, g). It also occurs frequently as colloform minerals within the cleavages of carbonaceous mudstone (Fig. 4a) and is occasionally replaced by pyrite (Fig. 4k, l). Pyrite in the deposit is subhedral-anhedral, fine-grained, coexists with sphalerite and dolomite (Fig. 4e), and crosscuts carbonaceous mudstone layers or is locally surrounded by sphalerite (Fig. 4a, c). Acicular marcasite formed with the sphalerite and fills interstitial space as euhedral-subhedral granular aggregates (Fig. 4h, i). Galena is typically euhedral to anhedral, fine-grained (0.1\u20130.2\u00a0mm), coexists with sphalerite and dolomite and fills fractures within sphalerite (Fig. 4j, k). The hydrothermal dolomite is euhedral-subhedral, medium-coarse-grained, and coexists with pyrite and sphalerite (Fig. 4l). Field geological and polished thin-section petrography combined with the results of previous research suggests that the alteration and mineralization at Banbianjie occurred in three main stages (Fig. 5\n): i) diagenetic (dolomite\u00a0+\u00a0calcite); ii) hydrothermal (sphalerite\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite\u00a0+\u00a0marcasite + (galena)\u00a0+\u00a0dolomite\u00a0+\u00a0calcite); and iii) supergene (limonite).\n\n\n3.4\nWall rock alteration\nWall rock alteration in the Banbianjie mining district is relatively weak and includes carbonatization, pyritization and bituminization, mainly of the altered dolostone, with local silicification. Carbonation, pyritization and bituminization are closely associated with Ge-Zn mineralization and thus can be important prospecting indicators. Bituminization occurs extensively in carbonaceous mudstones.\n\n\n\n4\nSamples and analytical methods\nAll of the samples in this study were collected from the main orebodies and surrounding rocks within underground developments in the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit. The in-situ determination of trace elements and rare earth elements (REEs) in hydrothermal dolomite was undertaken at the State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy Sciences (SKLODG-IGCAS), Guiyang, China using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and employing a standard-sample-standard analysis approach. The resulting data were calibrated by analysis of the SRM610, SRM612 (trace elements in glass), and MACS-3 (synthetic calcium carbonate microanalysis reference material) standards, with the accuracy of these data determined by analysis of the SRM610, SRM612, and MACS-3 standards every 15 unknowns. All analyses used a 44\u00a0\u03bcm diameter laser beam, and the resulting data have precision values better than 5%.\nHydrothermal dolomite C-O and pyrite and sphalerite S isotopic compositions were determined at the SKLODG-IGCAS. Representative samples were selected and hand crushed in a pestle and mortar to pass a 40\u201360 mesh. Single hydrothermal dolomite, sphalerite, and pyrite separates were then selected using binocular microscopy, yielding >99% pure separates. A total of 24 single mineral samples were analyzed, including 8 hydrothermal dolomite, 5 pyrite, and 11 sphalerite samples. These single mineral separates were soaked in 70% alcohol for 1\u20132\u00a0h before being dried and ground to pass a 200 mesh prior to further analysis. Hydrothermal dolomite C-O isotopic compositions were determined using a MAT-253 mass spectrometer and the 100% phosphoric acid method. The resulting \u03b413C and \u03b418O data are reported relative to the V-PDB and V-SMOW standards, respectively, with an analytical precision value of \u00b10.2\u2030 (2\u03c3). Sphalerite and pyrite S isotopic compositions were also determined using the MAT-253 spectrometer and are reported relative to the Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite (V-CDT) standard. The STD-1 (\u03b434SCDT\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.22\u2030), STD-2 (\u03b434SCDT\u00a0=\u00a022.57\u2030), and STD-3 (\u03b434SCDT\u00a0=\u00a0\u221232.53\u2030) standards were used for drift correction, and the precision of the resulting data is \u00b10.1\u2030 (2\u03c3).\nThe in situ Pb isotope analyses of sulfides were undertaken using a Neptune Plus multicollector ICP-MS instrument (MC-ICP-MS) equipped with a Geolas HD excimer ArF laser ablation system at the Wuhan Sample Solution Analytical Technology Co., Ltd, Hubei, China. Laser spot diameters ranged from 44 to 90\u00a0\u03bcm depending on Pb signal intensity with laser pulse frequencies ranging between 4 and 10\u00a0Hz and with a constant laser pulse intensity of \u223c5\u00a0J\/cm2. A new signal-smoothing and mercury-removing device was used downstream from the sample cell to efficiently eliminate the short-term variation of the signal and remove mercury from the background and sample aerosol particles. The isotopes 208Pb, 207Pb, 206Pb, 204Pb, 205Tl, 203Tl, and 202Hg were collected in Faraday cups using the static mode. The mass discrimination actor for Pb was determined using a Tl solution nebulized at the same time as the sample employing an Aridus II desolvating nebulizer. The mass fractionation of Pb isotopes was corrected using 205Tl\/203Tl employing an exponential law. Optimized values of 205Tl\/203Tl were calibrated using the reference materials MASS-1 (Wilson et al., 2002) and Sph-HYLM (Feng et al., 2018). The Sph-HYLM standard was used to monitor the precision and accuracy of the measurements after ten unknowns, yielding accuracy estimates of \u00b10.2\u2030 for 208Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb, and 206Pb\/204Pb compared with solution MC-ICP-MS analysis, which has a typical precision of 0.4\u2030 (2\u03c3).\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nRare earth elements\nThe REE contents of the seven hydrothermal dolomite and three altered wall rock samples are listed in Table 1\n and shown in Fig. 6\n. The total REE (\u03a3REE, excluding Y) contents of hydrothermal dolomites range from 53.3 to 98.5\u00a0ppm (mean 76.0\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a07), with light REE (LREE) contents ranging from 47.1 to 90.0\u00a0ppm (mean 67.8\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a07) and heavy REE (HREE) contents ranging from 6.17 to 10.3\u00a0ppm (mean 8.19\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a07). The \u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE ratios of the hydrothermal dolomite range from 5.32 to 10.6 (mean 8.40, n\u00a0=\u00a07), with (La\/Yb)N values of 3.47\u201313.76 (mean 8.76, n\u00a0=\u00a07) (subscript N indicates normalization to the chondrite values of Masuda et al., 1973). The hydrothermal dolomite records the fractionation of Eu, resulting in negative Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.43\u20130.68, mean 0.55, n\u00a0=\u00a07) as well as weakly positive Ce anomalies (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a01.13\u20131.20, mean 1.17, n\u00a0=\u00a07).\nThe \u03a3REE values of the hydrothermal dolomite are higher than those of the altered wall rock carbonates, although both have similar \u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE values. The altered wall rocks have \u03a3REE contents of 10.1\u201316.8\u00a0ppm (mean 12.9\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a03), and LREE and HREE contents of 8.94\u201315.2\u00a0ppm (mean 11.5\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a03) and 1.20\u20131.61\u00a0ppm (mean 1.40\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a03), respectively. Their \u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE ratios are 7.40\u20139.44 (mean 8.10, n\u00a0=\u00a03) and they have (La\/Yb)N values of 12.5\u201318.6 (mean 15.16, n\u00a0=\u00a03). They have distinctly fractionated Eu contents, with negative Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.43\u20130.74, mean 0.59, n\u00a0=\u00a03) that are similar to those of the hydrothermal dolomite. The altered wall rock carbonates also have negative Ce anomalies (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a00.71\u20130.79, mean 0.75, n\u00a0=\u00a03). All of these samples have similar Y\/Ho ratios (28.7\u201350.7, mean 35.93, n\u00a0=\u00a010).\n\n\n5.2\nCarbon-oxygen isotopic compositions\nThe C-O isotopic compositions of the eight hydrothermal dolomite and five wall rock samples analyzed during this study are given in Table 2\n and shown in Fig. 7\n. Hydrothermal dolomite has \u03b413CPDB and \u03b418OSMOW values of \u22120.97\u2030 to \u22120.24\u2030 (mean \u22120.62\u2030, n = 8) and +13.89\u2030 to +21.84\u2030 (mean\u00a0+\u00a017.64\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a08), respectively. In comparison, the wall rock carbonates have \u03b413CPDB and \u03b418OSMOW values of \u22120.51\u2030 to +1.46\u2030 (mean\u00a0+\u00a00.29\u2030, n = 5) and +23.87\u2030 to +25.36\u2030 (mean\u00a0+\u00a024.76\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a05), respectively, similar to those of the hydrothermal dolomite, but with slightly lower \u03b418OSMOW values (Fig. 7).\n\n\n5.3\nSulfur isotopic compositions\nThe S isotopic compositions of the 16 sulfide samples analyzed during this study are given in Table 3\n and are shown in Fig. 8\n. The \u03b434S values of sulfide samples from the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit range from \u221211.23\u2030 to \u22124.95\u2030 (mean \u22128.46\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a016) with sphalerite and pyrite separates having value from \u221211.23\u2030 to \u22127.72\u2030 and from \u221210.50\u2030 to \u22124.95\u2030, respectively, with average of \u22128.96\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and \u22127.37\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a05), respectively. These negative values have a decreasing trend of \u03b434Spyrite\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b434Ssphalerite (Fig. 8).\n\n\n5.4\nIn situ Pb isotopic compositions\nThe results of in-situ Pb isotope analysis of pyrite and sphalerite samples from the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit are given in Table 4\n and shown in Fig. 9\n. They have homogeneous Pb isotopic compositions with 206Pb\/204Pb ratios of 18.335\u201318.343 (mean 18.338, n\u00a0=\u00a05), 207Pb\/204Pb ratios of 15.725\u201315.735 (mean 15.729, n\u00a0=\u00a05), and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios of 38.288\u201338.326 (mean 38.308, n\u00a0=\u00a05).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSource and nature of mineralizing fluids\n\n6.1.1\nEvidence from rare earth elements\nThe REE geochemistry of Ca-bearing minerals such as calcite, dolomite, and fluorite can provide information on the source of ore-forming elements, temperature conditions, fluid migration, water\/rock (W\/R) interaction and ratios, and the nature of fluids involved in mineralization (Gagnon et al., 2003; Schwinn and Markl, 2005; Castorina et al., 2008; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2010). The fact that Ca2+ has a similar radius to most REEs means that REEs can be easily substitute for Ca2+ in Ca-bearing minerals as a result of the reaction 2Ca2+ \u2194 REE3+ + Na+ (Wood, 1990; Bau et al., 2003). Sulfide minerals (e.g., pyrite, galena, and sphalerite) also have negligible \u03a3REE contents (Zhou et al., 2011), indicating that the REE contents of the hydrothermal dolomites in the study area may be similar to the REE contents of the ore-forming fluids. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns for hydrothermal dolomites and altered wall rocks associated with the Banbianjie deposit are LREE depleted, similar to those of Devonian carbonate rocks in the Yangtze Block (Fig. 6b). The REE contents of the altered wall rocks are significantly lower than those of the Devonian strata, indicating leaching of REEs from the wall rocks (Fig. 6b). The hydrothermal dolomites also have similar \u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE and (La\/Yb)N values to the altered wall rocks (Table 1). Therefore, we suggest that the REEs in the hydrothermal dolomites are most likely derived from the Devonian carbonate wall rocks.\nTetravalent Ce and divalent Eu are typically fractionated from REE3+ during precipitation, generating positive or negative Eu and Ce anomalies (Chen and Fu, 1991; Ma and Liu, 1999). Trivalent Ce is easily oxidized to Ce4+ in alkaline and oxidizing conditions, and the solubility of Ce4+ is lower than the solubility of Ce3+, meaning that Ce4+ is easily adsorbed by hydroxides and thus lost from hydrothermal fluids (Elderfield and Sholkovitz, 1987; Lottermoser, 1992). This means that the weakly positive Ce anomalies of the hydrothermal dolomites from the Banbianjie deposit are indicative of interaction with acidic and reduced ore-forming fluids (Fig. 6a). Temperatures of >200\u00a0\u00b0C mean that Eu2+ dominates over Eu3+ and may substitute preferentially for Ca2+ over trivalent REEs, leading to positive Eu anomalies in the mineral precipitates (Bau and M\u00f6ller, 1993). The lack of positive Eu anomalies in the hydrothermal dolomite from the Banbianjie deposit indicates that the fluids that formed these carbonates never reached temperatures over 200\u00a0\u00b0C. This is supported by the presence of marcasite, which is stable at temperatures\u00a0<\u00a0240\u00a0\u00b0C and pH conditions\u00a0<\u00a05 (Figs. 3d and 4d, j; Murowchick and Barnes, 1986), suggesting that the ore-forming fluids were low temperature and acidic.\nThe Y\/Ho ratios of the hydrothermal dolomites vary from 28.7 to 35.6 and there is no evidence of magmatic activity in the study area, indicating that the fluids associated with these dolomites were not magmatic (Bau and Dulski, 1995). The presence of vein network-type mineralization is also indicative of an epigenetic system (Fig. 3b-c). In addition, M\u00f6ller and Morteani (1983) suggested that an Yb\/Ca vs. Yb\/La diagram can be used to determine the origin and evolution of hydrothermal fluids. All of the hydrothermal dolomite and altered wall rock samples plot in the hydrothermal field of this diagram (Fig. 10\n), suggesting W\/R interaction between the wall rocks and hydrothermal fluids.\n\n\n6.1.2\nEvidence from C-O isotopes\nHydrothermal dolomite is the main C-bearing mineral in the Banbianjie deposit (Figs. 3 and 4). This means that HCO3\n\u2212 or H2CO3 [present as CO2 (aqueous)] were the two dominant C species within the Banbianjie hydrothermal system (Zheng, 1990). Given that C isotope fractionation between HCO3\n\u2212 or H2CO3 (fluid) and CO2 (gas) is negligible, the calculated \u03b413CCO2 values could approximate theoretical \u03b413Cfluid values (i.e., \u03b413CCO2\u00a0\u2248\u00a0\u03b413Cfluid (Ohmoto, 1972; Zheng and Hoefs, 1993; Hoefs, 2009; Zhou et al., 2018a). The \u03b413CCO2 values were calculated using the following formula: 1000ln\u03b1 (CO2 - carbonate)\u00a0\u2248\u00a0\u03b413CCO2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b413CCarbonate\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.4612\u00a0+\u00a07.663\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\/(T\u00a0+\u00a0273.15)\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.988\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\/(T\u00a0+\u00a0273.15)2 (Bottinga, 1968), where T\u00a0=\u00a0temperature, and assuming an average temperature of 150\u00a0\u00b0C for the ore-forming fluid (Murowchick and Barnes, 1986; Leach et al., 2005; Leach et al., 2010). The \u03b418OH2O values were also calculated using the following formula: 1000ln\u03b1 (Carbonate - H2O)\u00a0\u2248\u00a0\u03b418OCarbonate - \u03b418OH2O\u00a0=\u00a02.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\/(T\u00a0+\u00a0273.15)2\u00a0\u2013\u00a03.39 (O'Neil et al., 1969). Calculated \u03b413Cfluid and \u03b418Ofluid values were based on the \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of the hydrothermal dolomite and range from \u22121.52\u2030 to \u22120.79\u2030 (average \u22121.2\u2030) and +1.75\u2030 to +9.71\u2030 (average +6.1\u2030), respectively (Table 2).\nThe C-O isotopic compositions of hydrothermal dolomite can constrain the source of C and O within a hydrothermal system (Zheng, 1990; Huang et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2016b). There are generally three potential reservoirs of C and O within hydrothermal fluid systems: i) mantle-derived magmas (\u03b413C and \u03b418O values from \u22128\u2030 to \u22124\u2030 and +6\u2030 to +10\u2030, respectively; Taylor et al., 1967; Dem\u00e9ny et al., 1998); ii) marine carbonates (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0-4\u2030 to +4\u2030, \u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0+20\u2030 to +30\u2030; Veizer and Hoefs, 1976); and iii) sedimentary organic matter (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u221230\u2030 to \u221215\u2030, \u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0+24\u2030 to +30\u2030; Kump and Arthur, 1999; Hoefs, 2009).\nThe theoretical \u03b413Cfluid (average \u22121.2\u2030) and \u03b413C (\u22120.97\u2030 to \u22120.24\u2030) values of the hydrothermal dolomite are higher than the values expected for organic matter and mantle-derived magmas, but they are similar to the values expected for marine carbonates and the compositions of the wall rocks in the study area (Fig. 7a; Table 2). This suggests that the C within the deposit was derived predominantly from the wall rocks, which can be compared to the Pb-Zn deposits in the region (Fig. 7b; Li et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2016b; Li et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018). Theoretical \u03b418Ofluid (average +6.1\u2030) and \u03b418O (+13.62\u2030 to +21.84\u2030) values for the hydrothermal dolomite are lower than the expected values for organic matter but lie between values expected for mantle-derived magmas and marine carbonates (i.e., the wall rocks in the study area; Fig. 7). The lack of magmatism in this region (Figs. 1 and 2; Dai et al., 2013), and the O isotopes data further suggest the W\/R interaction between hydrothermal fluids and the carbonate wall rocks.\n\n\n6.1.3\nEvidence from S isotopes\nThe main S-bearing minerals within the Banbianjie deposit are sphalerite, pyrite, and marcasite with minor amounts of galena (Figs. 3 and 4). Coexisting sulfides have \u03b434S values that decrease in the form \u03b434Spyrite\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b434Ssphalerite, suggesting that the reduced sulfur in the ore-forming fluids had attained thermodynamic equilibrium (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Ohmoto, 1986). This means that the \u03b434S values of these sulfides approximate the \u03b434S\u03a3S values of the ore-forming fluids (i.e., \u03b434S\u03a3S\u00a0\u2248\u00a0\u03b434Ssulfides; Ohmoto, 1972; Seal, 2006). Pyrite has \u03b434S values that range from \u221210.50\u2030 to \u22124.95\u2030 (average \u22127.37\u2030; Table 3) that are indicative of formation from hydrothermal fluids enriched in light S isotopes.\nPossible sources of sulfur within sulfide deposits include the mantle (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a0-3\u2030 to +3\u2030) and marine sulfate (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a0+10\u2030 to +30\u2030; Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Claypool et al., 1980). The C-O isotopic data above indicate that the mineralization did not involve a significant mantle-derived input. Sulfides from the Banbianjie deposit have \u03b434S values (\u221211.23\u2030 to \u22124.95\u2030) that are much lower than those expected for mantle-derived S but are similar to the compositions of sulfides from Devonian Pb-Zn deposits in South China (e.g., the Siding, Huodehong, and Beishan deposits) that contain S2\u2212 originally derived from evaporitic sulfates (Jin et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017; Fig. 8). Previous research has indicated that the Devonian carbonate rocks in this area contain numerous sulfate-bearing evaporate layers (Li et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2018), suggesting that these Devonian marine sulfates are the main source of the sulfur within the Banbianjie deposit.\nThe processes that can reduce SO4\n2\u2212 to S2\u2212 include thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR, \u039434Ssulfate - sulfide\u00a0=\u00a0\u223c15\u2030 \u00b1 5\u2030) and bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR, \u039434Ssulfate - sulfide\u00a0=\u00a040\u2030\u201360\u2030; Basuki et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2020; de Oliveira et al., 2021). Marine sulfate evaporates within the mineralized Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks in the study area have \u03b434S values that range from +21.9\u2030 to +25.9\u2030 (Ren et al., 2018). This strongly suggests that BSR was the main process responsible for the reduction of sulfur during the formation of the Banbianjie deposit. In general, BSR processes usually occur under low temperature conditions (<110\u00a0\u00b0C, Li et al., 2006; Basuki et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2018b), contrasting with the slightly higher temperature of the hydrothermal fluids associated with the deposit, which reach 150\u00a0\u00b0C; this temperature is too high for bacteria to survive. This suggests that BSR occurred before deposition of the sulfides within the study area. The presence of H2S in a closed system can also inhibit the reproduction of bacteria, with BSR requiring H2S concentrations to be generally <5% (Krouse et al., 1988; Worden and Smalley, 1996; Machel, 2001). This means that the BSR-derived H2S most likely migrated from the Devonian rocks to the site of ore deposition, and that the organic-enriched Devonian carbonaceous mudstones could have acted as a reducing agent as follows: 4Rx\u00a0\u2212\u00a0CH3\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a0+\u00a0H+\u00a0=\u00a04Rx\u00a0\u2212\u00a0COOH\u00a0+\u00a04H2O\u00a0+\u00a03H2S (Machel et al., 1995).\n\n\n6.1.4\nEvidence from in situ Pb isotopes\nSulfides usually contain extremely low U and Th contents and hence very low radiogenic Pb (Carr et al., 1995; Muchez et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2018). Hence, the Pb isotopic compositions can be used to constrain the sources of ore-forming materials and Pb within mineral deposits (Zhang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). Previous research has suggested that Pb in hydrothermal fluids is derived from mantle, crustal, or mixed mantle and crustal sources (Zartman and Doe, 1981), with variations in the proportions of Pb from these sources controlling the Pb isotopic compositions of different Pb-Zn deposits.\nSamples from the Banbianjie deposit plot above the average upper crustal Pb evolution curve of a 207Pb\/204Pb vs. 206Pb\/204Pb diagram (Fig. 9a; Zartman and Doe, 1981), suggesting that the Pb within the deposit was derived from the upper crust. These sulfide samples are compositionally similar to samples from the Niujiaotang and Huayuan Pb-Zn deposits (Fig. 9; Wu et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2005). They follow the trend of the Proterozoic Banxi Group instead of the Lower Cambrian reef limestone and black shale in this area. This suggests that the metals were derived from metamorphic basement rocks (Liu and Zhu, 1994; Schneider et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2003).\nThere are differences in the 206Pb\/204Pb composition of samples from the Ge-rich Banbianjie deposit relative to the Cd-rich Niujiaotang and Huayuan deposits, potentially reflecting the isotopic heterogeneity of the basement rocks. This is consistent with the fact that the mineralization in different parts of the South China low-temperature metallogenic domain has characteristic features that reflect differences in the nature and composition of the associated basement rocks (Hu et al., 2017). Nevertheless, a local mixture of Pb from basement rocks and Ge-rich organic matter layers cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n\n6.2\nPrecipitation mechanisms\n\n6.2.1\nDolomite precipitation\nA decrease in the temperature of hydrothermal fluids leads to an increase in the solubility of dolomite within the same fluid, indicating that dolomite cannot be precipitated directly from hydrothermal fluids by cooling alone (Zheng, 1990; Hoefs, 2009). There are three dominant processes involved in the precipitation of hydrothermal dolomite (Zheng and Hoefs, 1993; Zhou et al., 2018a): i) fluid mixing leads to the precipitation of dolomite; ii) CO2 degassing, where volatile components are removed from the hydrothermal fluid, causing precipitation of carbonate minerals such as hydrothermal dolomite and calcite; and iii) W\/R interaction, where fluids interact with wall rocks, allowing Ca2+, Mg2+ and other cations to enter hydrothermal fluids that gradually become carbonate saturated, leading to the precipitation of dolomite.\nThe C isotopic data presented in this study indicate that the majority of the carbon within the Banbianjie deposit is derived from the wall rocks (Fig. 7). This indicates that fluid mixing played an insignificant role in the precipitation of dolomite in the study area, and the dolomite may have formed as a result of W\/R interaction or carbon dioxide degassing (Zhou et al., 2018c). The results of the simulation of the C-O isotopic evolution curves of hydrothermal dolomite precipitated as a result of W\/R interaction between hydrothermal fluids (initial \u03b413Cfluid\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.2\u2030, \u03b418Ofluid\u00a0=\u00a0+6.1\u2030) and wall rocks are shown in Fig. 11\n and were calculated using the fractionation factors and C-O isotope equations of O'Neil et al. (1969) and Zheng and Hoefs (1993). These simulations indicate that the measured C-O isotopic compositions of samples from the study area plot along the evolution curves for HCO3\n\u2212 as the dominant C species within the mineralizing system (Fig. 11a). We also simulated the expected C-O isotopic evolution curves for CO2 degassing using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4\u00a0mol fractions of total C and O, an initial \u03b413Cfluid value of \u22121.2\u2030, and an initial \u03b418Ofluid value of +6.1\u2030 (Fig. 11b, c). The results show that the C-O isotopic data match well with the evolution curves of H2CO3 as the dominant C species, which is indicative of acidic mineralizing fluids (Fig. 11b, c). In addition, cyclic precipitation, dissolution, and reprecipitation processes can generate relatively metastable conditions (Zhou et al., 2018a), enabling the continuous formation of minerals such as hydrothermal dolomite. All of these data therefore suggest that the formation of the hydrothermal dolomite was the result of both CO2 degassing and W\/R interaction.\n\n\n6.2.2\nSulfide precipitation\nPrevious studies have shown that sulfide precipitation in hydrothermal systems is the result of three main processes (Anderson and Macqueen, 1982; Corbella et al., 2004; Leach et al., 2005; de Oliveira et al., 2019): i) mixing of metals and reduced sulfur, where metal-rich fluids mix with reduced sulfur-rich fluids at the deposit site; ii) sulfate reduction, involving a local source of sulfate reduced organically or inorganically; and iii) the addition of reduced sulfur, where metals and reduced sulfur are transported together to the deposit site. The significantly negative \u03b434S values obtained for sulfides from the study area indicate that the sulfur within the deposit was derived from marine sulfate by BSR (Jin et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b). However, the Pb isotopic data for the Banbianjie deposit indicate that the metals within the mineralizing system were derived mainly from basement rocks (Tang et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2016b; Li, 2018). This means that rapid mixing between fluids carrying metals and fluids carrying S2\u2212 is the main process responsible for sulfide precipitation. This is consistent with the extensive development of colloform and fibrous sulfides (Fig. 4a\u2013d), with these textures indicative of sulfide supersaturation and rapid precipitation.\n\n\n\n6.3\nOre genesis\nAs the mineralization within the Banbianjie deposit is predominantly stratabound and contains banded sulfides (Fig. 2), some studies suggested that it is quasi-syn-sedimentary in origin (e.g., Chen et al., 2006). However, the Banbianjie deposit has a number of characteristics that are similar to those of typical MVT deposits (Leach et al., 2005; Leach et al., 2010), including: i) orebodies hosted by dolostone within a passive margin-type platform carbonate sequence in an orogenic foreland basin setting; ii) the lack of a genetic link to igneous rocks or magmatism; iii) ores are controlled by structures and lithological boundaries (Fig. 2); iv) cross-bedding, open space filling, and metasomatic sulfides with clear epigenetic characteristics (Figs. 3 and 4); and v) simple wall rock alteration (i.e. carbonatization and pyritization) and sulfide assemblages (mainly sphalerite, pyrite and marcasite) with low ore grades (5.1\u00a0wt% Zn). All of this suggests that the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit is similar to the Huayuan and Niujiaotang deposits (Table 5\n), which are considered to be a typical MVT deposit (Ye et al., 2005 Ye et al., 2012; Cai et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016b; You, 2019). The geochemical characteristics of the deposit are indicative of formation as a result of mixing between basement- and basin-derived fluids. The acidic metal-rich fluids derived from the basement migrated into sedimentary rocks via structures such as the Huangsi fault-fold system. These fluids mixed with reduced sulfur-rich fluids at the transition between the Devonian carbonate rocks and carbonaceous mudstones (Fig. 12\n), with the carbonaceous mudstones acting as both an aquitard and a key geochemical reductant for the migrating hydrothermal fluids. Hence, the Banbianjie Ge-Zn deposit is the product of fluid\u2013structure-lithology coupled mineralization.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe REE and C-O-S-Pb isotopic data presented in this study indicate that the carbonate wall rocks, evaporates within the ore-hosting strata, and Precambrian basement are the main sources of the ore-forming elements.\n\n\n(2)\nWater-rock (W\/R) interaction and CO2 degassing were responsible for carbonate minerals precipitation. This carbonate buffering provided a relatively stable low-temperature, weakly acidic and reduced environment that was conducive to the formation of the Banbianjie deposit.

The known Sb deposits in China are mainly distributed along transition zones between different tectonic units or regional faults, and constitute a series of Sb metallogenic belts in different regions (Zhang et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2013). Among these belts, >500 Sb deposits with varying scales and grades have been found within the transition zone between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks in southern China, which constitute the giant Sb metallogenic belt in South China (i.e., the GSMB; Fig. 1\n; Xiao et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2020). However, despite decades of substantial efforts, the timing of Sb mineralisation in this belt remains highly variable because of the absence of suitable minerals for reliable radiometric dating, and a wide range of ages from\u00a0\u223c\u00a0420 to\u00a0\u223c\u00a0120\u00a0Ma has been obtained from various dating methods (Hu et al., 1996; Peng et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2018, 2020; Fu et al., 2019, 2020b; Zhang et al., 2019). Uncertainties over mineralisation ages and the significance of a possible link between tectonic events and abnormal Sb enrichment have hampered the understanding of the genetic model of these deposits in the GSMB.\nThe South China Block is tectonically bounded by the North China Craton by the Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt and North China Craton to the north, the Tibetan Plateau by the Longmenshan Fault to the northwest, and the Indochina Craton by the Song-Ma Fault to the south (Li and Li, 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Hu and Zhou, 2012; Fig. 1). It comprises the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks, which were welded along the Neoproterozoic Jiang-Shao tectonic suture zone, which coincides with the GSMB. The Cathaysia Block is well known for its Mesozoic large-scale granite province with a width of\u00a0>\u00a01,000\u00a0km and granite-related W-Sn polymetallic deposits, which have supplied >50% of the world\u2019s W and 20% of Sn reserves (Hu and Zhou, 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2013). Numerous studies have suggested that the subduction and subsequent post-subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate are responsible for producing large-scale magmatism and W-Sn mineralisation (John et al., 1990; Li and Li, 2007; Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012a,b; Hu and Zhou, 2012; Mao et al., 2013, Mao et al., 2021a, Mao et al., 2021b). However, though a possible link between the Sb mineralisation in the GSMB and large-scale magmatism in the South China Block was also proposed (Peng and Hu, 2001), the detailed relationship between this belt and subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate remains poorly understood.\nIn the past two decades, abundant new data on Sb deposits in the GSMB have been obtained and demonstrate that Sb deposits in this belt dominantly formed during the Late Mesozoic, although multiple episodes of Sb mineralisation have been identified (Peng and Hu, 2001; Xiao, 2014; Hu et al., 2017a, b; Fu et al., 2016, 2019, 2020a, Fu et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2018, 2020; Zhang et al., 2019). In this study, we compiled and reviewed available data of geological, geochemical and geochronological data of the Sb deposits in the GSMB and presented a comprehensive synthesis of Sb metallogeny in this belt. In compilation with reported geochronological data of Mesozoic granites in South China, we put forward a consistent geodynamic model for the giant Sb metallogenic belt in South China in relation to the flat-slab subduction of paleo-Pacific plate during Late Mesozoic.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Sb metallogenic belt in South China is predominantly located at the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block and to a lesser extent in the adjacent Cathaysia Block, comprising the traditional Jiangnan orogen and Xiangzhong basin to the north, and the Xiang-Gui-Yue basin and Youjiang basin to the south (Fig. 1; Xiao et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1998; Peng and Hu, 2001; Zhang et al., 2019). This NE-trending metallogenic belt extends approximately 1900\u00a0km long and 200\u00a0km wide, spanning seven provinces from Anhui to Yunnan (Fig. 1). It has provided more than 83.1% of the total Sb reserves in China, including 9 of 10 large Sb deposits in China and the world\u2019s largest Sb deposit at Xikuangshan (Zhang et al., 1998; Hu et al., 2016, 2017a, Hu et al., 2017b; Fu et al., 2020a, Fu et al., 2020b).\nThe GSMB experienced a complicated geological history as transition zone between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks (Liu et al., 1998; Shu, 2006, 2012; Li and Li, 2007; Zhao et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Fu, 2015). This history includes the following: (i) The paleo-South China Ocean (Cathaysia) subducted beneath the Yangtze block nucleus (Jinning Terrain) caused the continental collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks during Early Neoproterozoic (1000\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800\u00a0Ma) and resulted in a residual basin in the western part of Jiangshan in the GSMB (850\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800\u00a0Ma); (ii) The GSMB underwent continuous intra-continental sedimentation for approximately 400\u00a0Ma and the residual basin in South China was broken-up since Late Neoproterozoic, and the Caledonian orogeny during Early Paleozoic resulted in the final convergence of the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks in Caledonian; (iii) During Early Mesozoic, the westward subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate underneath the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent caused the formation of voluminous granitic plutons in the Cathaysia Block and eastern part of the Yangtze Block, and the associated deformation might have been caused by the collision between the Indochina and South China block, which is responsible to the closure of Paleotethys; (iv) During the Late Mesozoic Yanshanian event, the subduction and post-subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate beneath the Eurasian continent resulted the formation of the giant Yanshanian granitic province with a swath of\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0km.\nThe lithostratigraphic sequences of the GSMB were highly variable. The basement of the Yangtze Block is mainly composed of Neoproterozoic epimetamorphosed rocks (e.g., slates and other metasedimentary rocks) in the east, including the Banxi, Lengjiaxi, Fanjingshan, and Sibao groups. The sedimentary succession consists mainly of Cambrian to Triassic marine sedimentary rocks and Jurassic-Cretaceous and Cenozoic terrigenous sedimentary rocks (Peng and Hu, 2001; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). In contrast, however, only a small volume of igneous intrusions outcrop in the GSMB. There are sparse granites in the northeastern part of the Jiangnan Orogen belt, with ages from the Neoproterozoic to Early Cretaceous (Wang et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2005; Peng et al., 2006; Fu, 2015; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2017). In addition, a few small granitic intrusions and mafic dykes with Mesozoic ages also have been found in the Xiangzhong and Youjiang basins (Hu and Zhou, 2012; Mao et al., 2013; Pi et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017). However, the genetic link between these igneous rocks and Sb deposits remains debatable because of no significant spatial association between them.\nOn a regional scale, the Sb deposits in the northern part of the GSMB are distributed along with the NE- and NNE-trending regional deep faults whereas those in the southern part are distributed with NE- or NW-trending regional faults and mainly controlled by related deposit-scale faults. Host strata of these deposits vary from Neoproterozoic to Tertiary, where host rocks are mainly composed of sedimentary and carbonate rocks and counterpart epimetamorphic rocks.\nConsidering the reserve and quantity of Sb deposits and tectonic background, three featured regions of Sb mineralisation can be identified, notably, the Xiangzhong basin, Southeast Guizhou Province and the Dian-Qian-Gui area. The Xiangzhong basin is located at the eastern margin of the Yangtze Block (Fig. 1). Sb deposits in this area mostly occur along NE-striking regional structures on the margin and interior of the Xiangzhong basin including the Xikuangshan, Banxi, Woxi, and Zhazixi deposits (Fig. 2\n). This area underwent continuous sedimentation from the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic (Wang and Li, 2003). Ductile shearing, intense folding and granitic magmatism were produced by the Early Paleozoic Caledonian orogeny (Faure et al., 2009; Charvet et al., 2010). Additionally, beaded uplifts such as the Baimashan- Longshan, Weishan-Nanyue and Simingshan-Guandimiao uplifts formed during this period (Liu, 2005; Bai et al., 2013). Subsequently, the Xiangzhong basin formed between these uplifts and sedimentation resumed on the Pre-Devonian metamorphosed clastic strata (Fig. 2), which were unconformably overlain by the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic marine sedimentary sequence (Shi et al., 1993; Ma et al., 2002). In the Late Triassic, the NE-striking regional structures (e.g., the Xuefengshan uplift belt) were produced by the Indosinian orogeny (Shu et al., 2009; Chu et al., 2012a, b; Fig. 2). These regional structures were reactivated and the Xuefengshan belt was further uplifted during the Late Mesozoic tectonic event (Li et al., 2013). The geophysical data suggest that some concealed intrusions might be present at depth although igneous rocks of this period are rarely outcropped in the Xiangzhong basin (Li, 1996; Rao et al., 1999).\nThe Southeast Guizhou area is a polymetallic mineralisation region containing abundant Sb, Au, and Hg deposits, and is located at the southwestern edge of the Yangtze Block, the area adjacent to the Tethys and Pacific tectonic domain (Xu et al., 2010; Fig. 1). This area is a Paleozoic basin which was covered by a Paleozoic marine carbonatite sequence and underwent multiple tectonic events from Hercynian to Yanshanian (Zheng et al., 2019, Fig. 3\nA), in which the Dushan Sb ore field, Sandu-Danzhai Hg-Sb-Au ore field, and Leigongshan Sb-Au ore field have been found in this area. Sb deposits in the Dushan Sb ore field, including the Banpo, Banian, Beida and Weizhai deposits mostly occur within secondary faults of the NNE-trending Dushan and Lantu structures (Fig. 3B). Geophysical data suggest that concealed granites might be present at depth in the southeastern part of this area (Diao et al., 2017).\nThe Dian-Qian-Gui area is located at the southwestern margin of the Yangtze Block, and is structurally defined by the Mile-Shizong fault to the northwest, the Shuicheng-Ziyun-Bama fault to the northeast, and the Red River fault to the southwest (Fig. 4\n; Cai and Zhang, 2009; Yang et al., 2012; Faure et al., 2014). Early studies have suggested that the Dian-Qian-Gui area overlies the basement of Early Paleozoic strata and recorded significant marine sedimentation between the Late Paleozoic and Middle Triassic, experiencing a marine sedimentation with a thickness of ca.7000\u00a0m (Galfetti et al., 2008; Song et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2012). The marine sedimentary sequence was folded as an EW-trending Youjiang fold and thrust belt by the Indosinian uplift during the Late Triassic (Cai and Zhang, 2009; Yang et al., 2012). Magmatic rocks occurring in this area mainly include Late Permian dolerites (Zhang and Xiao, 2014), quartz porphyry dykes (Zhu et al., 2016) and lamprophyre dykes (Liu et al., 2010). However, only scarce magmatic rocks are present in known Sb deposits such as the Qinglong, Maxiong and Muli deposits (Wang et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2015).\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of representative Sb deposits\nThe geological features of most Sb deposits have been described in the literature, and the most important details of representative Sb deposit in the GSMB are summarised as follows. Notably, igneous rocks are rare in each Sb deposit, although some magmatism is observed in the GSMB.\n\n2.2.1\nBanxi Sb deposit\nThe Banxi Sb deposit is situated within the transition zone of the transitional region from the Xuefengshan uplift belt to the Xiangzhong basin (Fig. 2) with a total Sb reserve of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0100,000 tons and an average grade of 15.3%\u201325.9% Sb. This deposit contains two ore blocks, Jiangjiachong and Xiaogang, from south to north. The Neoproterozoic Wuqiangxi Formation of the Banxi Group is the major strata exposed in this deposit, which is lithologically composed of epimetamorphic clastic rocks with original features of littoral facies to neritic facies flysch sedimentary sequences (Fig. 5\nA). Quartz-porphyry dykes in the northern part of this deposit are the only intrusion rocks with a U-Pb age of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0220\u00a0Ma, which were cut by quartz-stibnite veins and thus were considered to be earlier than Sb mineralisation (Zhao et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2019). Orebodies of the Banxi deposit mainly occur as veins in the Neoproterozoic epimetamorphic rocks of the Wuqiangxi Formation and are controlled by the NE-trending regional fault F1 (a part of the regional Taojiang-Chengbu fault) and a set of secondary compressional torsional faults with an angle\u00a0>\u00a070\u00b0 (Fig. 5A; Li et al., 2018). The ore composition is simple, with stibnite as the principal ore mineral with minor arsenopyrite; the gangue mineral is dominated by quartz. Two types of fluid inclusions were identified in quartz as liquid-rich two-phase inclusions and CO2-rich inclusions. The fluid inclusion data suggested a low-temperature (170\u2013260\u00a0\u00b0C) and low-salinity (3%\u20136% NaClequiv.) metallogenesis (Li et al., 2019). The wall-rock alteration related to Sb mineralisation mainly includes silification, sericitisation and chloritisation (Li et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.2.2\nXikuangshan Sb deposit\nThe giant Xikuangshan Sb deposit within the Xiangzhong basin in Hunan Province is situated at the intersection of the NE-trending Taojiang-Chengbu and NW-trending Xikuangshan-Lianyuan basement faults (Fig. 2) with a total Sb metal reserve of\u00a0\u223c\u00a02.5 Mt and an average grade of\u00a0\u223c\u00a04% Sb. The dominated host rocks in the Xikuangshan deposit are Middle to Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous strata, which are mainly composed of carbonates and locally interbedded with siltstone, argillite, and shale (Fan et al., 2004; Peng et al., 2003a). These strata have been intensely deformed into a kilometre-scale, NNE-trending major fold structure referred to as the Xikuangshan complex anticline (Fig. 5B; Peng et al., 2003a; Yang et al., 2006). Fault F75 (a part of the Taojiang-Chengbu regional fault) cuts the northwest limb of the anticline, and almost all ore-bodies occur in the footwall of this fault (Fig. 5B). A NNE-trending lamprophyre dyke with a length of\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u00a0km is the only outcropping intrusive rock in the Xikuangshan deposit (Fan et al., 2004; Hu et al., 1996; Peng et al., 2003a). The Sb mineralisation in the Xikuangshan deposit consists of four ore blocks, referred to as Laokuangshan, Tongjiayuan, Wuhua, and Feishuiyan (Hu et al., 1996; Peng et al., 2003a). Orebodies mainly occur as stratiform and are strictly controlled by interlayer fault zones in silicified carbonates (Fig. 5B). Ore minerals in this deposit are primarily composed of stibnite with trace disseminated pyrite, and gangue minerals are dominated by quartz and calcite with minor barite, fluorite, and talc (Fan et al., 2004; Fu et al., 2020a; Hu et al., 1996; Hu and Peng, 2018; Peng et al., 2003a). Four types of fluid inclusions in the Xikuangshan Sb deposit were identified in quartz, fluorite, barite and stibnite including pure liquid phase, liquid-rich aqueous phase, vapour-rich aqueous phase and pure vapour phase. The fluid inclusion data suggested a low to meso-thermal (112\u2013366\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity (0.2%\u201315.4% NaClequiv.) ore-forming fluid. (Hu and Peng, 2018). Silicic alteration is the primary wall- rock alteration in the deposit and Sb orebodies never appear to exceed the limit of silicification zone (Hu et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2006). A lamprophyre dyke occurs in the eastern part of the orebodies as the eastern boundary of antimony mineralisation in the Xikuangshan ore district (Liu and Jian, 1983; Shi et al., 1993).\n\n\n2.2.3\nWoxi Sb polymetallic deposit\nThe Woxi Sb polymetallic deposit is situated in the northeast corner of Xuefengshan uplift belt in western Hunan province, China, which contains five ore blocks including Hongyanxi, Yuershan, Lijiaxi, Shiliupenggong, and Upper Woxi (Fig. 2; Gu et al., 2012; Zhu and Peng, 2015). The metal reserves for the Woxi deposit amount to 0.22 Mt of Sb, >50\u00a0t of Au, and 25,000\u00a0t of WO3, and the average grades of Sb, Au, W in the ores are 2.84%, 9.77\u00a0ppm and 0.3%, respectively. The dominated strata exposed in the Woxi region consist of the Proterozoic Lengjiaxi Group, Banxi Group and Cretaceous conglomerate. The Banxi Group is composed of Madiyi Formation and Wuqiangxi Formation. The Madiyi formation consist of low-grade metamorphic purple-red sericite slate, sandstone slate and calcareous sericitic slate. The orebodies in this deposit occur in the purple-red calcareous sericitic slate as quartz veins and are controlled by interlay Woxi faults (Fig. 5C; Gu et al., 2012). These quartz veins can be divided into banded vein, veinlet and discordant vein, and the banded vein provides about 70% of metal accumulation (Luo et al., 1984). Ore minerals are dominated by scheelite, pyrite, stibnite, native gold and wolframite with minor arsenopyrite, sphalerite and galena. The gangue minerals consist of quartz with minor sericite, carbonate and chlorite. The mineral paragenesis for this deposit was divided into four stages, including quartz-carbonate stage, quartz-scheelite stage, quartz-sulfide-gold stage, and late quartz-carbonate stage (Zhu and Peng, 2015). Fluid inclusion data yield homogenization temperatures of 180\u2013240\u00a0\u00b0C at quartz-scheelite veins with 2.41%\u20135.56% NaClequiv salinity, and 140\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C at quartz-sulfide-gold stage with a 0.88%\u20136.88% NaClequiv salinity. It suggested a low-salinity, low-to-moderate temperature ore fluid, consistent with other gold deposits in the Xuefengshan uplift belt (Zhu and Peng, 2015). The magmatic activities are absent in the mining area or adjacent regions.\n\n\n2.2.4\nBanpo-Banian Sb ore field\nThe Banpo-Banian Sb ore field is situated in southeast Guizhou, which contains two large Sb deposits of Banpo and Banian and a set of other medium-small scale Sb deposits, with a total Sb reverse of >200,000 tons (Diao et al., 2017). The dominant wall-rocks comprise Paleozoic carbonates and sandstone and Triassic limestone and dolomite, which are overlain on the Precambrian epimetamorphic rocks. The structural frame of this area is defined by the NE-trending Lantu Fault and Dushan Fault which is southern part of Songtao-Dushan regional fault. The Banpo and Banian Sb deposits were strictly controlled by the NNW-trending Dushan Fault (Fig. 3B). Sb mineralisation is mainly hosted in Devonian marine sedimentary rocks in the form of quartz-stibnite veins (Fig. 6\n; Xiao, 2014; Xue et al., 2019). The ore minerals are dominated by stibnite with trace pyrite, cinnabar, realgar and gangue minerals mainly quartz, calcite, dolomite, clay and barite (Shen et al., 2013; Xiao, 2014). Fluid inclusions occurring in quartz and calcite suggest a low temperature (120\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity (1.8%\u20138.3% NaClequiv.) ore-forming fluid. (Wang, 1995) Carbonization and silicification are the primary wall-rock alterations related to Sb mineralisation in these deposits.\n\n\n2.2.5\nQinglong Sb deposit\nThe Qinglong Sb deposit is in the northwestern part of the Dian-Qian-Gui area and contains eight ore blocks, including Dachang, Shuijingwan, Dishuiyan, Gulu, Houpo, Xishe, Sanwangping and Heishanjing. The proved total Sb reserve of this deposit is up to 0.27 Mt with an average grade of 2.6% Sb. Local strata outcropping in the deposit area are composed of carbonate rocks of the Maokou Formation and \u201cDachang\u201d layer of Middle Permian, E\u2019meishan basalt of Upper Permian, and sandstone and shale of the Longtan Formation (Fig. 7\nA), of which Sb mineralisation is mainly hosted in the \u201cDachang layer\u201d as quartz-stibnite veins. The \u201cDachang layer\u201d is lithologically composed of tuff, silicified breccia, which overlays the limestone of the Maokou Formation and is covered by E\u2019meishan basalt. The ore-controlling regional fault in the deposit is the NE-trending Mile-Shizong fault (Fig. 4), which controlled the distribution and occurrence of ore blocks (Fig. 7A; Peng et al., 2003b; Chen et al., 2018). The Qinglong deposit contains several ore blocks, including Gulu, Zhimi, Houpo, Heishanjing, Xishe and Dachang. Individual orebodies range from 50 to 610\u00a0m long and 40 to 120\u00a0m wide, dipping at 3\u00b0\u20138\u00b0 to the northwest. The primary ore minerals are composed of euhedral-subhedral stibnite, arsenian pyrite and fine-grained stibnite, and the gangue minerals are mainly jasperoid quartz, fluorite and barite. Ore-forming fluid is characterised by low temperature (130\u2013195\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity (4.3%\u20138.1% NaClequiv.) (Cai et al., 1997). Wall-rock alterations associated with Sb mineralisation include silicification and kaolinisation.\n\n\n2.2.6\nMaxiong Sb deposit\nThe Maxiong Sb deposit is in the southeastern part of the Dian-Qian-Gui area, which includes three ore blocks of the Maxiong, Poyan and Kagu with a total Sb reserve of\u00a0\u223c\u00a056,400 tons and an average grade of\u00a0\u223c\u00a05.4% Sb. Tectonically, the deposit is situated at the western margin of the Youjiang rift valley in the transitional area between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. The orebodies are mainly hosted in the unconformity between the Cambrian dolomite and the Upper Devonian Yujiang Formation muddy-carbonaceous clasolite and are controlled by NW-trending compression and scissor faults in the southwest wing of Maxiong anticline (Fig. 7B). The orebodies occur as irregular veins and lenses with a total length of 3200\u00a0m and dipping at 50\u00b0\u201380\u00b0 to the northwest. The primary ore minerals are composed of stibnite with trace pyrite and arsenopyrite and the gangue minerals are mainly quartz and minor calcite. Stibnite mainly occurs as grains with quartz, and minor columnar and acicular stibnite occurs in vein quartz (Wei, 1993). Ore-forming fluids revealed by fluid inclusions from quartz are characterised by low temperature (141\u2013210\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity (6.6%-10.1% NaClequiv.; Cai et al., 1997). Wall-rock alterations are dominated by extensive silicification.\n\n\n2.2.7\nMuli Sb deposit\nThe Muli Sb deposit is in the southwestern part of the Dian-Qian-Gui area and the central part of the Dian-Qian intercontinental rift valley, which is part of the ancient Yangtze Block margin rift (Wang, 1994). The stratigraphy in this area is semi-deep to shallow water shelf faces ranging from the Lower Devonian to Middle Triassic carbonate and shale. The orebodies are mainly hosted in Devonian Pojiao (D1p) thick-bedded silica rocks with multiple folds controlled by NW-trending faults (Fig. 7C). The total Sb reserve is approximately 0.17 Mt with an average grade of 5.2% Sb. The orebodies occur as veins and lenses and are consistent with the stratum attitude. The primary ore mineral is stibnite associated with pyrite, quartz, calcite and barite. Calcite mainly occurs in metallogenic fault structures in the late or post-ore stage (Han et al., 2019). Fluid inclusions from quartz and calcite suggest a low temperature (95\u2013196\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity ore-forming fluid (3.7%\u20138.8% NaClequiv) (Cai et al., 1997). Silification is the majority wall-rock alteration which is close to the Sb mineralisation (Fig. 7C).\n\n\n\n\n3\nTiming of Sb mineralisation in the GSMB\nPrecisely determining the timing of mineralisation is critical for constraining the ore genesis of hydrothermal deposits. However, the precise ages of Sb deposits in the GSMB remain scarce because of the absence of suitable minerals for traditional radiometric dating (Hu et al., 2017b; Fu et al., 2020b). Many Sb deposits in this belt have been mined for more than a century (e.g., Xikuangshan and Banxi) and widely studied by geologists for decades, but few studies have investigated the precise ages of Sb deposits because of the simple mineral assemblages. Over the past two decades, a wide range of Sb mineralisation ages from ca. 420\u00a0Ma to ca. 50\u00a0Ma have been determined by applying various radio-isotope dating methods such as Pb-Pb, K-Ar, 40Ar\/39Ar, Rb-Sr, Re-Os, Sm-Nd, (U-Th)\/He and electron spin resonance. On the basis of the methods and samples used, the reported ages of Sb mineralisation using different methods must be evaluated with caution. For example, Pb-Pb dating of sulfide minerals is widely recognised as unreliable, particularly in low-Pb systems such as those of Sb deposits in the GSMB, thus, they are not considered in this study.\nIn this study, we mainly reviewed and investigated the mineralisation ages of these representative Sb deposits obtained by Sm-Nd, Ar-Ar, Rb-Sr and (U-Th)\/He radio-isotope dating methods. For example, multiple dating methods, including hydrothermal calcite and stibnite Sm-Nd isochron and zircon (U-Th)\/He dating, have been employed to determine the mineralisation age of the giant Xikuangshan Sb deposit in the Xiangzhong basin and yielded an age range of 120\u2013155\u00a0Ma (Hu et al., 1996; Fu et al., 2020b). An age of ca.130\u00a0Ma of the Banxi Sb deposit was obtained using Rr-Sr isochrons of major ore minerals such as stibnite, arsenopyrite, and zircon (U-Th)\/He dates (Li et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2019). More recently, an age of ca. 130\u00a0Ma of the Woxi deposit was also obtained using scheelite and wolframite U-Pb dates (unpublished data). In the southeast Guizhou area, Sm-Nd isochrons of hydrothermal calcite were used to date the Banpo and Banian Sb deposits in the Dushan ore field and yielded ages of 130\u00a0Ma and 126\u2013128\u00a0Ma, respectively (Wang, 2012; Xiao, 2014). In comparison, however, the mineralisation ages of Sb deposits in the Dian-Qian-Gui area were slightly older. For example, Peng et al. (2003b) proposed the Qinglong Sb deposit formed at 142\u2013148\u00a0Ma using Sm-Nd dating of hydrothermal fluorite from ore veins. The Maxiong Sb deposit was dated at 141\u2013156\u00a0Ma using K-Ar and Rb-Sr isochron methods of quartz from quartz-stibnite veins (Wei, 1993) while the Muli Sb deposit was dated at ca.165\u00a0Ma using Ar-Ar isochrons of hydrothermal quartz (Hu et al., 2007; Han et al., 2019).\nIn summary, the aforementioned age data of representative Sb deposits indicate that Sb mineralization in the GSMB mainly took place during the Late Mesozoic (160 \u2013120\u00a0Ma), and a possible age distribution trend of Sb mineralisation in GSMB was also identified, i.e., from ca. 120\u2013130\u00a0Ma for Sb deposits in the central and northeastern part of this belt (e.g., Xikuangshan, Banxi, Woxi, Banpo, and Banian deposits) to ca. 140\u2013165\u00a0Ma for Sb deposits in the southwestern part (e.g., the Qinglong, Muli and Maxiong deposits; Fig. 11B). Notably, however, more geochronological studies using robust dating methods are required to further constrain the precise timing of large-scale Sb mineralisation in the GSMB.\n\n\n4\nOrigin of Sb deposits in the GSMB\nThe origin of the Sb deposits in South China has long been debated and various viewpoints have been invoked including intrusion-related and intrusion-unrelated models (Hu et al., 2017a; Chen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020; and references therein). Continuing argument in this respect is driven principally by uncertainties over the significance of a possible magmatic link with Sb mineralisation. Over the past two decades, abundant new data including fluid inclusion, stable isotopes, noble gas, and other geochemical data, have been obtained that enable improvement in understanding the origin of these Sb deposits.\nFluid inclusion studies suggest that ore-forming fluids of Sb deposits in the GSMB are generally characterised by low temperature (average temperature with 140\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C) and low salinity (0.2%-10% NaClequiv.) (Wang and Jin, 1994; Wang and Cui, 1996; Cai et al., 1997; Shen et al., 2008; Su et al., 2015; Hu and Peng, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). The fluid inclusion data of each Sb deposit revealed an increasing trend of mineralisation temperature of Sb deposits in the GSMB from southwest to northeast, 95\u2013210\u00a0\u00b0C for those in the Dian-Qian-Gui area, 120\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C for those in Southeast Guizhou area, and 112\u2013366\u00a0\u00b0C for those in the Xiangzhong basin. In general, the \u03b4DVSMOW-\u03b418O composition can place a first-order constraint on the origin of the ore-forming fluids for hydrothermal deposits. The \u03b4DVSMOW and \u03b418O values of ore-forming fluids for Sb deposits in the GSMB calculated from fluid inclusions in ore-related hydrothermal minerals range from \u2212128\u2030 to \u221246\u2030 and \u221210.2\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a011.9\u2030, respectively (Wang, 1995; Xie et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1998; Yin and Dai, 1999; Peng et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2012; Lin, 2014; Zhu and Peng, 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Pan and Wu, 2017; Li et al., 2019). In a \u03b4DVSMOW-\u03b418O diagram of fluid inclusions trapped in hydrothermal quartz and calcite, most samples from representative Sb deposits plot within the transition field of meteoric water and magmatic\/metamorphic water (Fig. 8\n), indicating a mixing origin of ore-forming fluids, i.e., admixture of magmatic or metamorphic water and meteoric water. However, because the latest metamorphic event documented in this district (460\u2013400\u00a0Ma; Faure et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010) occurred many hundred millions of years ago before the timing of Sb mineralisation in the GSMB, metamorphic fluids thus are unlikely to be candidates as one end-member of ore-forming fluids. In addition, the majority of large Sb deposits is primarily hosted in Neoproterozoic epimetamorphic clastic rocks or Devonian-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, with no obvious direct spatial relationship to magmatic activity, indicating that magmatic fluids seem unlikely to be the major component of ore-forming fluids for these Sb deposits. Recent experiment study demonstrated that weak partitioning of Sb into magmatic fluids makes it unlikely that primary magmatic fluids serve as the Sb source of large epithermal Sb deposits (Fu et al., 2020c). Alternatively, the Mesozoic meteoric water can be one of the end members of ore-forming fluid sources since lots of H-O isotope plots of all investigated Sb deposits are close to the meteoric water line (Hu et al, 2016; Pan and Wu, 2017). The other end member could be interpreted as a result of water\u2013rock interaction between meteoric water and \u03b418O-enriched wall rocks or \u03b418O-enriched basement rock (Peng et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017a), which can be further favoured by following He-Ar isotopic data.\nArgon and He isotope ratios in fluid inclusions entrapped hydrothermal sulfide minerals such as pyrite and stibnite have been proved effective for identifying the sources of ore-forming fluids for hydrothermal deposits because of the significant difference in 3He\/4He and 40Ar\/36Ar ratios for fluids derived from different geochemical reservoirs (Stuart et al., 1994; Burnard et al., 1999; Burnard and Polya, 2004; Davidheiser-Kroll et al., 2014). For example, crustal fluids are characterised by low 3He\/4He (0.01\u20130.05 Ra, where Ra is the atmospheric 3He\/4He ratio, 1.39\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6) while the 3He\/4He of mantle-derived fluids can be up to 6\u20139 Ra (Burnard et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2009; Mark et al., 2011). The 3He\/4He values for ore-forming fluids from the Banxi and Qinglong Sb deposits are ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 Ra and 0.13\u20130.46 Ra, respectively (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018), which are close to that of crustal fluids but much lower than mantle-derived fluids. This indicates that the ore-forming fluids of these Sb deposits were dominantly generated from crustal fluids. Accordingly, the 40Ar\/36Ar values are range from 409 to 545 and 305\u2013326, respectively (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018), which are comparable to those of air-saturated water (meteoric), implying that ore-forming fluids are probably dominated by Mesozoic meteoric water. In the 3He\/4He-40Ar\/36Ar diagram (Fig. 9\n), all samples from the Banxi deposit plot within the field of crustal fluid, whereas most samples from the Qinglong deposit plot in the field between crustal fluids and air-saturated water. More recently, Hu (2021) proposed that ore-forming fluids of the giant Xikuangshan Sb deposit are also dominated by Mesozoic modified air-saturated meteoric water based on similar He-Ar isotopic compositions. Therefore, the ore-forming fluids of the Sb deposits in the GSMB were likely to be dominated by Mesozoic meteoric water but were compositionally modified by fluid-rock interaction during the evolution of fluids.\nThe sulfur isotopic composition of a sulfide deposit can be variable because of multiple possible sources of sulfur in the metallogenetic environment, thus, sulfur isotopes can provide insights into the origins of sulfide minerals in hydrothermal deposits (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Hoefs, 2009). Advances in analytical methods, particularly in micro-analytical techniques (e.g., LA-ICP-MS), enable new sulfur isotope data of some representative Sb deposits in the GSMB to be obtained. The S isotope compositions of Sb deposits in the GSMB are shown in the Fig. 10\n, ranging from 4.8\u2030 to 6.7\u2030 in Banxi, 6.8\u2030 to 10.2\u2030 in Xikuangshan, \u22122.8\u2030 to \u22121.2\u2030 in Woxi deposit, \u22126.3\u2030 to 2.6\u2030 in Banian, 3.4\u2030 to 7.5\u2030 in Banpo, \u22125.0\u2030 to 2.3\u2030 in Qinglong, \u221214.5\u2030 to 3.8\u2030 in Muli and 3.6\u2030 to 7.7\u2030 in Maxiong (Cui, 1992, 1995; Wang, 1995; Gu et al., 2004, 2012; Shen et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2020a). The wide range of \u03b434S values of the fluid in these deposits indicates a complex source of sulfur in different Sb deposits. The \u03b434SV-CDT values of deposits in the Xiangzhong basin, such as Banxi, Xikuangshan and Woxi show a narrow range, whereas the \u03b434SV-CDT values of deposits such as Banian-Banpo, Qinglong and Muli in southeast Guizhou and the Dian-Qian-Gui area range within a wider range (Fig. 10). The wide \u03b434SV-CDT values of Sb deposits in the GSMB can be generated by mixing between wall-rocks and magmatic sulfur, or dissolution of sulfides in basement sequences (Hu et al., 2017a; Li et al., 2018, 2019; Fu et al., 2020a). However, as discussed above, the H-O isotope and He-Ar isotopes and the absence of magmatic rocks in ore field suggest that the input of magmatic sulfur into the Sb deposits is insignificant. Trace elements and isotope geochemical data of Precambrian sedimentary strata in South China (Ma et al., 2002, 2003; Ma, 2008; Xu et al., 2012) revealed that the Proterozoic strata are generally enriched of W, Sn, Sb, and Au. The ore-forming metals in Proterozoic basement strata might have been pre-concentrated during previous magmatic events during early tectonic events (Hu, 2021). Therefore, it can be inferred that Proterozoic basement strata could have been the potential sulfur source of these deposits in the Sb belt (Ma, 2008; Hu et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2020a; Hu, 2021 and references therein).\nIn conclusion, Sb deposits in the GSMB may have formed from evolved meteoric water, which circulated through regional faults and leached Sb and S from the basement metamorphic rocks because of the interaction between the rocks and circulating meteoric fluids. By contrast, deep-seated magmas may have served as heat sources for the circulation and transportation of Mesozoic meteoric water along regional faults (Hu et al., 2017a).\n\n\n5\nPossible link between the paleo-Pacific plate subduction and Sb mineralisation\nExtensive magmatism in South China produced one of the largest magmatic provinces worldwide by widespread igneous rocks consisting of granites, rhyolites and subordinate mafic intrusions and volcanic rocks (Li and Li, 2007; Hu and Zhou, 2012; Mao et al., 2013, Mao et al., 2021a, Mao et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2016). Geochronological data indicate that the magmatic events in South China mainly occurred during the Indosinian Period (251\u2013205\u00a0Ma), Early Yanshanian Period (180\u2013150\u00a0Ma), and Late Yanshanian Period (140\u201370\u00a0Ma) (Zhou et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011). The spatiotemporal distribution of Mesozoic igneous rocks reveals an increasing density and a younger trend toward the ocean (southeastward) (Li and Li, 2007; Li et al., 2007). Additionally, the distribution of igneous rocks with progressively younger northeastwards was also identified (Fig. 11A; Zhou et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). Pacific plate subduction into the Eurasian continent during the Early Yanshanian (>140\u00a0Ma) and post-subduction during Late Yanshanian Period (140\u201370\u00a0Ma) is widely believed to be responsible for the formation of abundant granitic rocks in South China, with the most famous models including the low-angle subduction model (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2006), flat-slab subduction model (Li and Li, 2007; Li et al., 2007) and large-scale extensional model (Mao et al., 2021a, Mao et al., 2021b). The low-angle subduction model interpreted that the overall southeastward migration of magmatism in Southeast China was a result of a northwest- to west-north- westward subduction of the Pacific oceanic lithosphere during the Late Mesozoic (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2006). The flat-slab subduction model proposed that a flattened Pacific oceanic lithosphere that was caused by underflow of an oceanic plateau with a diameter of approximately 1000\u00a0km migrated further into the South China Block, followed by slab foundering (Li and Li, 2007; Li et al., 2007). The large-scale extensional model suggested that the subducted Paleo-Pacific plate was broken in the mantle transition zone in the deep of eastern China, and left a stagnant fragment in asthenospheric mantle during slab retreat. The eastern Asian continent margin undergone extension which led to the formation of related structure, metamorphism and magmatism (Mao et al., 2021a, Mao et al., 2021b). However, the drifting direction of the Paleo-Pacific plate changed several times, of which the major transition event occurred in 125\u2013122\u00a0Ma when the drifting direction changed by 80\u00b0 from southwest to northwest (Sun et al., 2007). Combining the younger trend northeastward of igneous rocks during 180\u2013125\u00a0Ma (Fig. 11A; Zhou et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011), Wang et al. (2011) proposed that a southwestward subduction was followed by a northeastward rollback of the Pacific oceanic slab.\nIn previous study Peng and Hu (2001) proposed a model of two-stage tectonic- magmatic activation to interpret the formation of the GSMB in the Southeast Yangtze Block, in which W-Sn-Zn-Pb and granite-related rare-metal deposits were considered to form at first stage (J3-K1) in South China, and the low-temperature deposits are formed at the second stage (K2-E1). However, the model is conflicted with the temporal consistence between the Sb deposits in GSMB and the granite-related W-Sn polymetallic deposits in the Cathaysia block (Hu and Zhou, 2012; Mao et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017a, Hu et al., 2017b). Furthermore, the ages of major large or giant Sb deposits in the GSMB, as investigated in this study, are mainly concentrated in a limited range (160\u2013120\u00a0Ma) and show a consistent geochronological trend with those of igneous rocks in South China (Fig. 11\nB). Therefore, considering the presence of deep-seated granites in the GSMB revealed by geophysical data, we propose that the formation of the GSMB in southeastern edge of the Yangtze Block also was related to the subduction and post-subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during Late Mesozoic, same as that of the igneous rocks and related W-Sn deposits in the Cathaysia block.\n\n\n6\nDynamic model of Sb mineralisation in the GSMB\nBased on the aforementioned discussion, we invoked a model of the west-northwestward slab-flat subduction and post-subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during Late Mesozoic for the formation of the giant Sb metallogenic belt in South China. Firstly, the west-northwestward slab-flat subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate occurred during the transformation of the tectonic regimes in South China at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0180\u00a0Ma (Maruyama 1997; Zhou and Li, 2000; Scotese, 2002; Zhou et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011). The subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during 180\u2013140\u00a0Ma and followed extensive crustal extension not only triggered large-scale magmatism and related W-Sn and Cu-Ag (Au) mineralisation in Cathaysia Block (Fig. 12\nA, B; Zhou et al., 2006; Li and Li, 2007; Wang et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2021a, b), but also produced extensive concealed magmatism in the GSMB, which display a younger trend from the Dian-Qian-Gui area towards the Xiangzhong area that is broadly consistent with the age distribution trend of the Sb deposits in the GSMB (Fig. 12C). Therefore, in combination of reported geological and geochemical data, a new geodynamic model for the formation of GSMB in South China can be invoked that assumes deep circulation of low-temperature and low-salinity crustal fluids through faults under an extensional tectonic setting during Late Mesozoic (160\u2013120\u00a0Ma), mobilization of Sb and sulfur from the basement sequences and ascending along deep faults and subsequently deposition of Sb in or around fault\/fracture zones (Fig. 12C). Concealed magmatism may have served as heat sources for circulation and transportation of crustal fluids to form Sb deposits in GSMB.\n\n\n7\nSummary and remaining issues\nThe GSMB in South China contains >500 Sb deposits with various scales and grades. Available studies suggest that the majority of large Sb deposits in the GSMB mainly formed during the Late Mesozoic (160\u2013120\u00a0Ma), and the ages of these Sb deposits show a younger trend from southwest to northeast, which is similar to that of igneous rocks in the Cathaysia Block, implying that they formed under a similar geodynamic setting. The west-northwestward slab-flat subduction and post-subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during the Late Mesozoic are probably responsible for both Sb deposits in the GSMB and igneous rocks and associated W-Sn deposits in South China. Deep-seated granitic magmatism that occurred during the subduction and rollback of the paleo-Pacific plate provided a heat source for the circulation of possible meteoric fluids and leaching of Sb from basement sequences to form Sb deposits in the GSMB. However, a critical issue is that the sources of huge Sb metal in these large Sb deposits remain poorly understood because the Sb content is relatively low (typically\u00a0<\u00a01\u20132\u00a0ppm) in the potential candidates of source rocks in this region (Ma et al., 2002; Hu, 2021), and further work is required to clarify the mechanisms of super- enrichment and transportation of Sb in hydrothermal systems to form large Sb deposits.\n\n","51":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Southeast Missouri Iron Metallogenic Province in the Midcontinent region, USA occurs within an area of 35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0115\u00a0km and hosts seven major and over twenty minor iron ore deposits\/prospects that are found within early Mesoproterozoic (\u223c1500\u20131440\u00a0Ma) igneous rocks of the Eastern granite-rhyolite province (Fig. 1\nA, B; Kisvarsanyi and Proctor, 1967; Kisvarsanyi and Kisvarsanyi, 1989; Seeger, 2000). In addition to iron ore, these deposits and prospects are also speculated to contain economically significant amounts of copper, cobalt, manganese, and rare earth elements (Kisvarsanyi and Proctor, 1967; Kisvarsanyi and Kisvarsanyi, 1989; Seeger, 2000; Day et al., 2016). In the western part of the Southeast Missouri Iron Metallogenic Province, iron ore deposits such as Pea Ridge, Kratz Spring, Bourbon, Boss, and Camels Hump, are overlain by 200\u2013500\u00a0m thick Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. In the eastern part of the metallogenic province, i.e., in the St. Francois Mountains, deposits such as Iron Mountain, the Pilot Knob Magnetite and Hematite deposits, Shepherd Mountain, and Cedar Hill, occur at shallower depths (<120\u00a0m) or in outcrop (Fig. 1B, C). Outcropping deposits such as Iron Mountain, the Pilot Knob Hematite deposit, Shepherd Mountain, and Cedar Hill, were mined for iron since the early 1800\u00a0s (Starkey and Seeger, 2016). Deeper deposits (\u2265120\u00a0m; Kratz Spring, Bourbon, Pea Ridge, Camels Hump, and the Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit) were discovered through aeromagnetic surveys in the 1940\u00a0s. Of these, only Pea Ridge (mined from 1964 to 2001) and the Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit (1965\u20131980) were developed into underground mining operations (Seeger, 2000).\nAlthough the near-surface iron ore deposits were periodically mined for >150\u00a0years, most of them remain poorly studied. Pea Ridge is the most extensively studied deposit and has been proposed to be an Iron Oxide Apatite (IOA) deposit (e.g., Nold et al., 2014; Aleinikoff et al., 2016; Ayuso et al., 2016; Day et al., 2016; Harlov et al., 2016; Hofstra et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Neymark et al., 2016). Other relatively well-studied deposits are the Boss deposit, proposed to be an Iron Oxide Copper Gold-type deposit (IOCG; Seeger, 2003; Groves et al., 2010; Nold et al., 2014; Day et al., 2016), and the magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal Pilot Knob Magnetite IOA deposit and the overlying hydrothermal Pilot Knob Hematite deposit (Nold et al., 2013; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021).\nIt is well established that IOA and IOCG-type deposits are structurally or stratigraphically controlled (Hitzman, 2000; Williams et al., 2005; Groves et al., 2010). Several genetic models for the formation of IOA-type deposits have been proposed that are highly debated and include: (1) A magmatic model wherein an intermediate silicate melt separates into coexisting immiscible Fe-P-rich and Si-rich melts. In this model, volatiles such as F, Cl, and H2O are hypothesized to preferentially partition into the Fe-P melt, making it less dense and thus allowing it to ascend from the source magma to a shallower depth and form an IOA-type deposit (Nystr\u04e7m and Henr\u00edquez, 1994; Naslund et al., 2002; Tornos et al., 2017; Hou et al., 2018); (2) A magmatic-hydrothermal model in which a fluid exsolves from a magma and extracts metals from a silicate melt (Hildebrand, 1986; Jonsson et al., 2013; Westhues et al., 2017); (3) A hydrothermal or metasomatic model involving a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid (Menard, 1995; Dare et al., 2015) or a mixed ore fluid that consists of magmatic-hydrothermal and basinal brines (Rhodes and Oreskes, 1999); and (4) a combined magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal model in which primary igneous magnetite microlites serve as nucleation sites for fluid bubbles and, therefore, are extracted to exsolving hypersaline magmatic-hydrothermal fluid along with Fe, Cu, Au, S, Cl, and P. As the fluid cools during ascent and emplacement, the igneous magnetite grows larger, sourcing metals from the fluid (Knipping et al., 2015, 2019; Ovalle et al., 2018; Simon et al., 2018).\nIn contrast to the different models proposed for the formation of IOA deposits, there is a growing consensus that IOCG-type deposits form primarily through hydrothermal processes, although the fluid source remains a topic of debate (Barton and Johnson, 1996; Pollard, 2006; Groves et al., 2010; Barton, 2014). Proposed fluid sources range from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that scavenge metals from silicate melts (Pollard, 2006; Nystr\u04e7m et al., 2008; Rieger et al., 2010, 2012; Corriveau et al., 2016; Acosta-G\u00f3ngora et al., 2018) to basinal brines that incorporate metals from the crust (Barton and Johnson, 1996; Sillitoe and Burrows, 2002; Barton, 2014). Based on the spatial and temporal associations between the IOA-IOCG deposits observed in the Chilean Iron Belt and the Great Bear Magmatic Zone, researchers suggested that these types of deposits form a continuum in which IOCG deposits are surface-near expressions of deeper IOA systems (Sillitoe, 2003; Knipping et al., 2015; Corriveau et al., 2016; Reich et al., 2016; Simon et al., 2018).\nThe iron ore deposits in the Southeast Missouri Iron Metallogenic province generally fit into the IOA\/IOCG group of deposits and have been broadly compared with Kiruna-type IOA and Olympic Dam-type IOCG deposits (Kisvarsanyi and Kisvarsanyi, 1989). In addition to these IOA\/IOCG-type deposits, a series of shallow vein-hosted iron oxide deposits occurs in the metallogenic province, such as the Shepherd Mountain, Shut-Ins, and Hogan deposits (Nold et al., 2014). If (and how) the shallow vein-type deposits are genetically related to the deeper IOA\/IOCG-type deposits remains poorly understood although Nold et al. (2014) speculated that the vein-type deposits represent parts of a plumbing system connected to deeper magmatic iron ore deposits although currently no solid evidence exists to support such a hypothesis.\nPrevious studies on the ore-forming processes in the Shepherd Mountain deposit (Fig. 1B, C) have been controversial. Kisvarsanyi (1966) suggested that the deposit formed from a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid that was contemporaneous with faulting in the region. In contrast, Dudley and Nold (2001) proposed Si-poor hydrothermal fluids from which the iron oxides precipitated, although the fluid source was not specified. Consequently, the processes that formed the Shepherd Mountain deposit, and its relation to the geodynamic evolution of the Southeast Missouri Iron Metallogenic province, remain poorly understood. To constrain the genesis of the Shepherd Mountain deposit, we combine new petrographic observations with whole-rock geochemical data of iron oxide-mineralized samples and host rocks, as well as trace element and Fe isotope compositions of the iron oxide minerals. The data are used to characterize both the iron source and the processes that facilitated the formation of the vein-type mineralization. The Shepherd Mountain data are integrated with new and previously published (Tunnell et al., 2021) data from the nearby Pilot Knob deposits to reflect on a possible genetic link between the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob ore system.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nIron oxide deposits in Southeast Missouri occur in the Mesoproterozoic St. Francois Mountains, part of a larger Granite-Rhyolite terrane that spans from Ohio through Illinois and Missouri to Texas (Fig. 1A, B; Van Schmus et al., 1996; Rohs and Van Schmus, 2007; Bickford et al., 2015). The Granite-Rhyolite terrane is comprised of early Mesoproterozoic (\u223c1500\u20131440\u00a0Ma) and middle Mesoproterozoic (1330\u20131300\u00a0Ma) bimodal plutonic rocks (Kisvarsanyi, 1981; Van Schmus et al., 1996; Menuge et al., 2002; Bickford et al., 2015; du Bray et al., 2021). The early Mesoproterozoic suite is broadly distributed in the eastern mid-continent and therefore is commonly referred to as the Eastern Granite-Rhyolite Province (EGRP), whereas the younger middle Mesoproterozoic suite is largely spread in the southern mid-continent, and thus is referred to as the Southern Granite-Rhyolite Province (Fig. 1A; Van Schmus et al., 1993). Overlap of the two suites occurs in the St. Francois Mountains terrane, wherein the younger suite intruded into the older rocks (e.g., Bickford et al., 2015).\nThe Granite-Rhyolite terrane lies between the older Mazatzal (1680\u20131600\u00a0Ma) province to the west and the younger Grenville (1300\u2013900\u00a0Ma) province to the east, all of which form northeast-trending accretionary provinces that were added to the Laurentia supercontinent during an\u00a0\u223c\u00a0800 Myrs period of accretionary orogenesis (Karlstrom et al., 2001; Whitmeyer and Karlstrom, 2007). After an episode of tectonic inactivity between 1600\u00a0Ma and 1550\u00a0Ma, juvenile terranes and arcs resumed to accrete to the Laurentia supercontinent (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom, 2007). During the accretionary stage, the Granite-Rhyolite province has been proposed to be a product of back-arc extension, possibly caused by lithospheric delamination (Bickford et al., 2015; Day et al., 2016; Watts and Mercer, 2020; du Bray et al., 2021; Tunnell et al., 2021). The Nd-line within the Granite-Rhyolite province (Fig. 1A), delineated by Van Schmus et al. (1996), separates an older cratonic (>1550\u00a0Ma) source to the northwest from a juvenile source (<1550\u00a0Ma; possibly oceanic arc crust) to the southeast for the extensive magmatism of the early Mesoproterozoic (Bickford et al., 2015), and marks the western margin of the St. Francois Mountains terrane and the iron metallogenic province.\nIron deposits and prospects in the southeastern Missouri metallogenic province are genetically associated with the early Mesoproterozoic magmatic event from 1500 to 1440\u00a0Ma (Aleinikoff et al., 2016; Ayuso et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021) and are hosted in caldera-forming volcanic and volcanoclastic sequences composed of voluminous dacite to high-silica rhyolite ignimbrites, lava flows, volcaniclastic breccias and sediments, ring fractures, and lesser amounts of basaltic andesite to dacite and trachyte volcanic and subvolcanic rocks (Kisvarsanyi, 1980, 1981; Day et al., 2016). The parental magma that is considered as the source for iron has been proposed to be derived from a subduction-modified subcontinental lithospheric mantle (Watts and Mercer, 2020; Tunnell et al., 2021) and remelting of the presumed oceanic island arc crust of calc-alkaline composition due to underplating of the mafic magma (Ayuso et al., 2016; Bickford et al., 2015; du Bray et al., 2021).\n\n2.1\nGeology of the Shepherd Mountain deposit\nThe Shepherd Mountain deposit is located southwest of the town of Pilot Knob in Precambrian outcrops on Shepherd Mountain (Fig. 1C). Previous studies of the Shepherd Mountain deposit are rare and generally limited to conference abstracts (Dudley and Nold, 2001, 2004) or short sections in regional-scale studies that primarily focus on other deposits (Kisvarsanyi, 1966; Kisvarsanyi and Kisvarsanyi, 1989; Nold et al., 2014; Day et al., 2016). Iron ore extraction at the Shepherd Mountain deposit started in 1815 and continued until the American Civil War, with 75,000 tons of iron ore produced (Crane, 1912). Ore production was restricted to two trenches (Fig. 1C) that contained magnetite ore that has been fully extracted. The northern trench is approximately 15\u00a0m wide and 140\u00a0m long, whereas the southern trench is about 20\u00a0m wide and 400\u00a0m long. The thickness of the magnetite veins varies between 1 and 7\u00a0m, pinching and swelling both along the strike and with depth. The two magnetite veins are hosted in the 1466\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0Ma Shepherd Mountain rhyolite (U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age; du Bray et al., 2021). In addition to magnetite, the deposit also contains subordinate hematite and minor pyrite. The iron ore is structurally localized along two brittle fault and fracture systems, contemporaneous with the deposition of the ore (Kisvarsanyi, 1966), that strike NE 40-60\u00b0 and dip steeply to the northwest at 70-80\u00b0 (Day et al., 2016). The contact between the vein and host rock is relatively sharp (Fig. 2), while alteration is largely limited to an assemblage of K-feldspar\u00a0+\u00a0hematite\u00a0+\u00a0quartz in the rhyolite adjacent to the ore veins. Fragments of rhyolitic host rock entrained in the magnetite veins (Fig. 2) show evidence for K feldspar alteration with locally abundant pyrite, quartz, calcite, epidote, albite, and hematite (Day et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nSample preparation\nThree rhyolitic host rock and eighteen iron oxide-mineralized samples from the Shepherd Mountain deposit were collected from unmineralized outcrops (Fig. 2A, B) and an unprocessed ore pile next to the northern mining trench (Fig. 1C, 2C, D). The ore samples were prepared as polished one-inch diameter mounts. Additionally, five thin sections were prepared: three from the Shepherd Mountain rhyolite (Fig. 2B), one from the contact between ore and host rock (Fig. 2E; sample ID: SM-F11), and one from the breccia ore (Fig. 2F; Sample ID: SM-F2).\nUltra-pure two mushketovite and two magnetite concentrates (30\u201350\u00a0mg) were prepared from four Shepherd Mountain ore samples for iron isotope analysis. Two samples also contained specularite and were used to prepare 30\u201350\u00a0mg of ultra-pure specularite concentrates. All mineral concentrates were prepared in the Department of Geosciences and Geological and Petroleum Engineering (GGPE) at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T), Rolla, Missouri following the method described in Tunnell et al. (2021).\n\n\n3.2\nPetrographic studies\nThe samples were examined under reflected- and transmitted-light using a Leica DVM 6 digital microscope at Missouri S&T. A subset of samples was further characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) backscattered electron (BSE) imaging and wavelength dispersive spectra (WDS) elemental x-ray mapping with a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Milan (Italy).\n\n\n3.3\nElectron microprobe analysis\nThe major and minor element chemistry of magnetite and hematite was determined using a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe equipped with wavelength and energy dispersive spectrometers (WDS and EDS) in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Milan, Italy. The analyses were conducted in WDS mode using a 1\u20132\u00a0\u00b5m diameter beam with an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV, a beam current of 10nA, and a counting time for each element of 30\u00a0s on peak and 10\u00a0s on background. Calibration and data reduction were done with measurements on natural and synthetic standard materials. The standards used were grossular (for Ca, Si), omphacite (Na), K-feldspar (K), olivine (Mg), fayalite (Fe), anorthite (Al), ilmenite (Ti), Cr metal (Cr), nickeline (Ni), Co metal (Co), rhodonite (Mn) and V-metal (V). Elemental concentrations were determined after applying \u03c6(\u03c1z) algorithm and corrections for X-ray fluorescence, absorption, atomic number (Z) and matrices, and by evaluating spectral interferences. Typical detection limits were 140\u00a0ppm for Ca and Al, 190\u00a0ppm for Mg, 200\u00a0ppm for Si, 220\u00a0ppm for Ti, 235\u00a0ppm for Na, 350\u00a0ppm for Mn and V, and 400\u00a0ppm for Cr, Co and Ni. Analyses were performed after verifying that Ixstd\/Istd was 1.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 for each element, where Ixstd was the intensity of the analyzed standard and Istd the intensity of the same standard checked after calibration for each element. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were collected by means of the scanning electron microscope adjoined to the probe apparatus. Elemental x-ray maps for Si, Al, and Ti were acquired in WDS mode with a beam current of 100nA and with 0.5 and 1\u00a0\u00b5m steps.\n\n\n3.4\nLaser ablation ICP-MS analysis\nTrace element concentrations of iron oxides were determined using a Resonetics Resolution M\u221250 Excimer 193\u00a0nm laser coupled with an Agilent 7900x inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) at LabMaTer, University du Quebec a Chicoutimi (UQAC), Canada. The analysis used a spot size of 15\u00a0\u00b5m to 50\u00a0\u00b5m with an energy of 12\u00a0mJ\/pulse and a fluence of 4.8\u00a0J\/cm2. Thirty seconds of background were measured followed by 30\u201340\u00a0s of data acquisition. The following mass stations were measured: 23Na, 24Mg, 27Al, 29Si, 31P, 39K, 44Ca, 45Sc, 47Ti, 51V, 52Cr, 55Mn, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 63Cu, 65Cu, 66Zn, 71Ga, 74Ge, 89Y, 90Zr, 92Zr, 93Nb, 95Mo, 118Sn, 139La, 140Ce, 141Pr, 146Nd, 147Sm, 153Eu, 157Gd, 159Tb, 161Dy, 165Ho, 167Er, 169Tm, 173Yb, 175Lu, 178Hf, 181Ta, 182W, and 208Pb. All data were reduced using the Glitter software (Griffin et al., 2008). Elemental abundances were determined using the USGS Fe-rich glass reference material GSE-1 as a bracketing standard and Fe concentrations obtained by electron microprobe as the internal standard. The certified reference material glasses GSD (USGS glass: Jochum et al., 2007), Gprob6 (USGS-matrix artificial basalt glass), and the Ti-rich magnetite standard BC-28 (Dare et al., 2014) were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the analyses. As summarized in Online Resource ESM-1, most trace elements were determined with an accuracy of\u00a0<\u00a05% and a 2\u03c3 precision of\u00a0<\u00a010% for the GSD standard, an accuracy of\u00a0<\u00a015% and a 2\u03c3 precision of\u00a0<\u00a015% for the Gprobe6 standard. However, higher uncertainties were observed for a few elements with low concentrations in the Gprobe6 standard, whereas higher uncertainties were found in the BC-28 standards for most trace elements, as it is a natural sample from Bushveld Complex and, therefore, some elements are heterogeneously distributed within the crystal lattice (cf.\nDare et al., 2014).\n\n\n3.5\nIron isotope analysis\nThe ultra-pure mushketovite, magnetite, and specularite concentrates were dissolved in 4\u00a0ml heated ultrapure aqua regia and the solutions were dried. Iron was purified using a BioRad MP-1 anion exchange resin after drying the Fe solution following the procedure by Mar\u00e9chal et al. (1999). The analysis was then performed using a Neptune multi-collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at Pennsylvania State University, USA. The instrument setup, sample introduction, and running conditions used are described in Yesavage et al. (2016). Individual samples were measured twice at approximately 2\u00a0ppm in high-resolution mode, which generated a 13\u00a0V signal on the shoulder of the Fe peak. The instrumental mass bias was corrected for all measurements by bracketing with international IRMM-014 standard (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, Belgium, Taylor et al., 1992). Results are reported relative to IRMM-014 using Eq. (1):\n\n(1)\n\u03b456Fe (\u2030)\u00a0=\u00a0[(56Fe\/54Fe)measured\/(56Fe\/54Fe)IRMM-14 \u2013 1] * 1000\n\n\n\nThe in-house standard SRM-3126a with reported value of \u03b456Fe\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u2030\u00b10.1\u2030 2\u03c3 (Yesavage et al., 2016) yielded an average value of \u03b456Fe\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a06). The international standard HPS-WU with reported value of \u03b456Fe\u00a0=\u00a00.60\u2030\u00b10.07\u2030 2\u03c3 (Beard et al., 2003) yielded an average value of \u03b456Fe\u00a0=\u00a00.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a06). All errors fall within the range of 0.1\u2030 2\u03c3 of the standards.\n\n\n3.6\nWhole-rock analysis\nMajor, minor, and trace element whole rock analyses of host rocks and ore samples were carried out at Activation Laboratories, Ontario, Canada. Major elements were measured using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis with detection limits of 0.001\u20130.01\u00a0wt%. Trace element contents were determined by open vessel multi-acid digestion followed by ICP-MS analysis (detection limits of 0.01\u201330\u00a0ppm). Comparison of analyzed reference materials (DNC-1, GBW 07113, TDB-1, W-2a, SY-4, and BIR-1a) with certified values show that major elements were determined with a precision of better than 7% accuracy and a 2-sigma external precision\u00a0\u2264\u00a03%. Trace elements were mostly determined with an accuracy of better than 10% and a precision of\u00a0\u2264\u00a04% (2-sigma; ESM-2).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrography of the Shepherd Mountain deposit\n\nVolcanic host rocks: The volcanic host rock of the Shepherd Mountain deposit is a porphyritic rhyolite containing phenocrysts of alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and devitrified fiammes (Fig. 2B). The fiammes are replaced by quartz and feldspar in a microcrystalline matrix of quartz (Fig. 3\nA). Alkali feldspar phenocrysts (<2 mm long) show subhedral to anhedral textures and advanced signs of alteration to calcite and locally contain epidote and chlorite (Fig. 3B). Plagioclase phenocrysts (<1 mm long) display subhedral to anhedral textures (Fig. 3C). Most plagioclase phenocrysts show evidence for clay alteration, while only a few phenocrysts kept their polysynthetic twinning (Fig. 3C). It is noted that the volcanic host rocks locally contain disseminated magnetite that is partially martitized (Fig. 3A, B).\n\nContact Zone: The contact between the ore veins and the volcanic host rock (Fig. 2E) is characterized by the presence of abundant calcite, epidote, chlorite, and quartz (Fig. 3D, E). In the contact zone, the host volcanic rock and its phenocrysts (e.g., plagioclase) are largely replaced by microcrystalline quartz and minor calcite (Fig. 3F). Locally, fragments of host rock that are cemented by iron oxides (Fig. 2F) within brecciated parts of ore veins show potassic and silicic alteration (Fig. 3G, H, I), while abundant epidote with minor chlorite occur between iron oxides (e.g., mushketovite, specularite) and K feldspars (Fig. 3G, I). Central portions of the fragments entrained from the host rock are characterized by silicification wherein the pre-existing minerals are replaced largely by quartz with minor calcite (Fig. 3H).\n\nOre veins: The iron ore veins consist of brecciated (Fig. 2F) and massive ores (Fig. 2G, H). Brecciated ores are characterized by elongated mushketovite, a magnetite pseudomorph after specularite, which was identified under reflected light based on its reflectance, color and lamellar-like habit (Fig. 4\nA, B), whereas massive ores contain euhedral to subhedral granular magnetite (Fig. 4C, D, E, H, I). Ore veins also contain lesser hematite and minor to trace amounts of pyrite. In SEM-BSE images, mushketovite exhibits patchy zoning with dark and bright domains (Fig. 4B). Granular magnetite shows oscillatory zoning patterns with alternating dark-gray and light-gray bands of varying widths and bright domains that do not show any sign of zonation (Fig. 4C, E, F, I). Hematite occurs as specularite and as martite, a pseudomorph after magnetite (Fig. 4A, C, D, H). Both mushketovite and granular magnetite are partially altered to martite (Fig. 4A-E, G, H) and martitic alteration locally shows zoning patterns with a colloform texture (Fig. 4D). Locally restricted disseminations of anhedral pyrite fill open-spaces between iron oxides (Fig. 4G).\n\n\n4.2\nChemical composition of iron oxides from the Shepherd Mountain deposit\nThe results of the electron microprobe analyses on iron oxides and laser ablation ICP-MS data are presented in Online Resource ESM-1. Iron oxides from the Shepherd Mountain deposit can be divided into mushketovite, high-Si magnetite, low-Si magnetite, specularite, and martite. Here, high-Si magnetite refers to magnetite with\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0wt% SiO2, as per Shiga (1988), and corresponds to darker domains of magnetite in the SEM-BSE images shown in Fig. 4C, E, F, and I. In contrast, low-Si magnetite has\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0wt% SiO2 and corresponds to brighter domains of magnetite in BSE images (Fig. 4E, F, I). Elemental X-ray maps in Fig. 5\n display clearly distinct bands of Si and, to a lesser extent, Al. Darker domains in the BSE images correspond to the elevated Si contents with alternating bands within the oscillatory zonation. Along with Si, Al and Ti appear to be slightly elevated in the darker domains (although less so than Si). However, in some cases, Ti does not change correspondingly with either Si or Al such as shown in Fig. 5B; instead Ti shows a different chemical behavior during magnetite growth.\n\nMagnetite: Electron microprobe analyses show that high-Si magnetite, with\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0wt% SiO2, contains between 67.6 and 71.1\u00a0wt% Fe (average of 69.3\u00a0wt%) and 0.5\u20132.4\u00a0wt% Si, while low-Si magnetite, with\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0wt% SiO2, is characterized by 71.2\u201374.5\u00a0wt% of Fe (average of 72.8\u00a0wt%) and 0.01\u20130.5\u00a0wt% Si (ESM-1). Laser ablation-ICP-MS analyses show that the high-Si magnetite contains between 660 and 12400\u00a0ppm Al, 390 to 5000\u00a0ppm\u00a0Mg, and 1500 to 9200\u00a0ppm Ca. In contrast, low-Si magnetite contains between 140 and 2000\u00a0ppm Al, 12 to 840\u00a0ppm\u00a0Mg, and 25 to 2200\u00a0ppm Ca. Low-Si magnetite is further characterized by lower contents of high field strength elements (HFSE: Ti, Nb, and Sc) (Fig. 6\nA); typically between 25 and 340\u00a0ppm Ti, 0.004\u20130.73\u00a0ppm Nb, and 0.1 \u2013 3.7\u00a0ppm Sc, whereas high-Si magnetite contains between 14 and 550\u00a0ppm Ti, 0.05\u20131.6\u00a0ppm Nb, and 3\u201340\u00a0ppm Sc. Conversely, both high-Si and low-Si magnetite grains have similar concentrations of first-row transition elements (FRTE), i.e., between 420 and 1900\u00a0ppm Mn, 45\u2013140\u00a0ppm Co, and 4\u201317\u00a0ppm Ni, except for Cr and V. Chromium and V concentrations vary from 0.4 to 22\u00a0ppm Cr and 1 to 66\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, respectively, in high-Si magnetite, whereas they range from 0.3 to 2.1\u00a0ppm Cr and 10 to 110\u00a0ppm\u00a0V in low-Si magnetite (Fig. 6A, ESM-1). With regards to granitophile-group elements (Pb, W, Sn, Mo), high-Si magnetite is relatively more enriched as it contains between 0.3 and 8.4\u00a0ppm Pb, 7.7\u201368\u00a0ppm\u00a0W, 0.8\u20135.6\u00a0ppm Sn, and 0.2\u2013122\u00a0ppm Mo. Low-Si magnetite grains are characterized by between 0.01 and 4.4\u00a0ppm Pb, 0.01\u201348\u00a0ppm\u00a0W, 0.1 \u2013 1.2\u00a0ppm Sn, and 0.03 \u2013 7.8\u00a0ppm Mo (Fig. 6A, ESM-1).\n\nMushketovite: Electron microprobe analyses show that mushketovite contains between 72.6 and 73.9\u00a0wt% Fe (average of 73.3\u00a0wt% Fe) and 0.01\u20130.4\u00a0wt% Si (Fig. 6B; ESM-1). Laser ablation-ICP-MS analyses show that mushketovite contains between 370 and 1550\u00a0ppm Al, 110 \u2013 720\u00a0ppm\u00a0Mg, and 1180 \u2013 1450\u00a0ppm Ca. With regards to HFSE, mushketovite contains between 35 and 90\u00a0ppm Ti, 0.05 and 0.7\u00a0ppm Nb, and 1.8 and 4.8\u00a0ppm Sc. In terms of FRTE, mushketovite contains between 6 and 37\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, 4.2\u00a0ppm Cr (detected in only one analysis), 720\u20131000\u00a0ppm Mn, 64\u201369\u00a0ppm Co, and 6\u201310\u00a0ppm Ni. Additionally, it contains 3.8 to 8\u00a0ppm Pb, 980 to 3450\u00a0ppm\u00a0W, 0.7 to 26.5\u00a0ppm Sn, and 10.7 to 34\u00a0ppm Mo.\n\nSpecularite: Electron microprobe analyses show that specularite contains between 69.2 and 71.4\u00a0wt% Fe (average of 70.4\u00a0wt% Fe) and 0.004\u20130.2\u00a0wt% Si (Fig. 6B; ESM-1). Laser ablation-ICP-MS analyses show that specularite contains between 110 and 3400\u00a0ppm Al, 2\u20131075\u00a0ppm\u00a0Mg, and 6 \u2013 620\u00a0ppm Ca. In terms of HFSE, specularite contains between 130 and 4200\u00a0ppm Ti, 0.2\u201310\u00a0ppm Nb, and 1.4\u2013147\u00a0ppm Sc (Fig. 6b). Among the FRTE, V contents in specularite vary between 16 and 140\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, 0.2\u20135.3\u00a0ppm Cr, 36\u2013810\u00a0ppm Mn, 0.1\u201323\u00a0ppm Co, and 0.03\u201310\u00a0ppm Ni. With respect to granitophile-group elements, specularite contains between 0.4 and 7\u00a0ppm Pb, 22\u20132800\u00a0ppm\u00a0W, 0.4\u201317\u00a0ppm Mo, and 2\u2013135\u00a0ppm Sn (Fig. 6B).\n\nMartite: Electron microprobe analyses show that martite contains between 68.1 and 71.5\u00a0wt% Fe and 0.02\u20130.5\u00a0wt% Si. Laser ablation-ICP-MS data show that martite contains between 820 and 1700\u00a0ppm Al, 12\u2013450\u00a0ppm\u00a0Mg, 32 \u2013 1550\u00a0ppm Ca. Among the HFSE, martite contains 42\u2013280\u00a0ppm Ti, 0.02 \u2013 0.2\u00a0ppm Nb, and 1.3\u20134.4\u00a0ppm Sc (Fig. 6B). Additionally, martite contains between 30 and 86\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, 0.6\u20132.0\u00a0ppm Cr, 550\u20131430\u00a0ppm Mn, 56\u201366\u00a0ppm Co, and 11\u201314\u00a0ppm Ni (Fig. 6B). In terms of granitophile group elements, martite contains between 0.1 and 218\u00a0ppm\u00a0W, 0.1 \u2013 0.6\u00a0ppm Sn while Pb is between 1.4 and 7.4\u00a0ppm and Mo is between 0.1 and 6.8\u00a0ppm, which are similar to that within specularite (Fig. 6B).\n\n\n4.3\nChemical composition of iron oxides from the Pilot Knob magnetite deposit\nIn addition to the new mineral data from Shepherd Mountain, this study also presents the first trace element data for magnetite, martite, and hematite from the PKM deposit obtained by laser ablation ICP-MS (Fig. 6, ESM-1) that complements a single LA-ICP-MS analysis reported by Huang et al. (2019). It is noted that the trace element composition of martite and hematite was only measured on a sample from shallow depth (\u223c177\u00a0m; sample ID: PKM-1098\u2013580) as samples from deeper portions only contained very minor hematite and martite. The trace element data are integrated with Fe contents obtained by electron microprobe from Tunnell et al. (2021).\n\nMagnetite from the PKM deposit contains between 70.8 and 74.0\u00a0wt% Fe (average of 73.1\u00a0wt% Fe) and between\u00a0<\u00a0140\u00a0ppm and 6600\u00a0ppm Si. It is noted that, in contrast to the Shepherd Mountain deposit, no high-Si magnetite was observed in the PKM deposit. Laser ablation-ICP-MS data show that magnetite contains between 20 and 8900\u00a0ppm Al, 3.4\u20131040\u00a0ppm\u00a0Mg, and 5 \u2013 1140\u00a0ppm Ca (Fig. 6A, ESM-1). In terms of HFSE, PKM magnetite contains between 70 and 3500\u00a0ppm Ti, 0.01\u20135\u00a0ppm Nb, and 0.1\u20137\u00a0ppm Sc (Fig. 6A, ESM-1). Among the FRTE, the PKM magnetite contains between 36 and 340\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, 0.2\u201356\u00a0ppm Cr, 340\u20131850\u00a0ppm Mn, 10\u201367\u00a0ppm Co, and 5\u201340\u00a0ppm Ni (Fig. 6A, ESM-1).

The average \u03b456Fe values for mushketovite, magnetite, and specularite are \u22120.35\u2030, \u22120.21\u2030, and \u22120.13\u2030, respectively.\n\n\n4.5\nWhole-rock geochemistry\nNew whole-rock data for iron oxide-mineralized samples from the Shepherd Mountain deposit and their volcanic host rocks are integrated with publicly available USGS whole-rock data that have been compiled by Day et al. (2017). All new whole-rock data discussed here are presented in ESM-2.\n\nVolcanic host rocks: The volcanic host rocks of the Shepherd Mountain deposit are classified as rhyolite and dacite based on the immobile element diagram of Nb\/Y vs. Zr\/Ti (Pearce, 1996) that is used to eliminate alteration effects (Fig. 8\nA). Consequently, the host rocks of the Shepherd Mountain deposit are similar to the host rocks of the PKM deposit (Fig. 8A). The rhyolites and dacites plot as volcanic arc granite on Y vs. Nb diagram (Fig. 8B; Pearce et al., 1984), but approximately half the samples display A-type signatures while the others show I & S type granite on Ga\/Al*104 vs. Zr diagram (Fig. 8C; Whalen et al., 1987). The host rocks of the Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit mostly plot as within-plate A-type granites. On the (Y\/Nb)N vs. (Th\/Nb)N diagram, the host volcanic rocks fall within the field of A2 type granite that indicates emplacement at a convergent boundary (Fig. 8D; Moreno et al., 2014).\nC1 chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of the host rhyolites of the Shepherd Mountain deposit display a strong fractionation between light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE) with a flat trend from medium REE (MREE) to HREE, similar to the host rhyolites of the PKM deposit (Fig. 9\nA). However, the host rocks of the Shepherd Mountain deposit show a pronounced Eu negative anomaly (EuN\/EuN* = 0.4 \u2013 0.7), while the PKM host rocks display only a slight and\/or no negative Eu anomaly (EuN\/EuN* = 0.6 \u2013 0.9; Fig. 9A; ESM-2). Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE)-normalized multi-element spider diagrams for both the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob deposits show negative anomalies for Nb, Ta, Sr and Sc, and enrichments in Th, La, Ce, Pb, and Nd (Fig. 9B).\n\nOre samples: Magnetite- and hematite-mineralized whole-rock ore samples from the Shepherd Mountain deposit contain between 47\u00a0wt% and 97\u00a0wt% Fe2O3 (ESM-2). C1 chondrite normalized REE patterns show a decreasing trend from La to Lu with a wide range of variability with respect to LREE, whereas less variability is observed in MREE and HREE (Fig. 10\nA). The PKM ore samples display a similar decreasing trend from LREE to MREE, but a flat trend from MREE to HREE. Pronounced negative Eu anomalies (EuN\/EuN* = 0.3\u20130.7) are observed for the Shepherd Mountain mineralized samples, while the PKM ore samples show variable Eu anomalies (EuN\/EuN* = 0.7 \u2013 1.6; Fig. 10A). Bulk silicate Earth (BSE)-normalized multi-element spidergrams show negative anomalies for Nb, Ta, Sr, Ti, and Al, while the PKM ore samples display similar negative peaks for Nb, Ta, and even a stronger Sr depletion (Fig. 10B). The Shepherd Mountain ore samples have higher concentrations of Sc, but lower concentrations of Ti and Al compared to the PKM ores (Fig. 10B).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nAlthough the Shepherd Mountain iron ore deposit was previously mined from 1815 to 1865, studies on its genesis are rare and limited to conference abstracts (Dudley and Nold, 2001, 2004) and short paragraphs in papers that otherwise focus on different deposits and\/or regional geologic aspects (Kisvarsanyi, 1966; Kisvarsanyi and Kisvarsanyi, 1989; Nold et al., 2014; Day et al., 2016). Previous studies proposed either a (i) magmatic-hydrothermal deposition of ore controlled by contemporaneous fault systems (Kisvarsanyi, 1966); or (ii) a hydrothermal origin related to infiltration by a Si-poor fluid (Dudley and Nold, 2001). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that identify the fluid source(s) and quantitatively discuss how the Shepherd Mountain deposit is genetically related to the nearby magmatic-hydrothermal Pilot Knob ore system. Although Nold et al. (2014) hypothesized that vein-type deposits in southeast Missouri represent part of plumbing system where they form from ascending Fe-bearing ore fluids from magmatic deposits at depth, this hypothesis remained untested until this study. Furthermore, previous studies did not fully unravel the order of mineralizing events in the Shepherd Mountain deposit that are indicated by the different ore minerals and textures. Here, we investigate the following aspects:\n\n(i)\nThe order of events that formed the different ore textures which we propose in Fig. 11\n.\n\n\n(ii)\nThe genesis of the Shepherd Mountain deposit and whether it is of magmatic-hydrothermal or hydrothermal origin.\n\n\n(iii)\nA possible genetic link between the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob deposits which we propose in the illustration shown as Fig. 12\n.\n\n\n\n\n5.1\nOre-genetic sequence of the Shepherd Mountain deposit\n\n5.1.1\nOrigin of the breccia ores\nAt Shepherd Mountain, mushketovite occurs in brecciated samples where it forms a cementing groundmass between individual clasts derived from the host rocks (Fig. 2F). Mushketovite is a pseudomorphic replacement of specularite by magnetite that forms under reducing conditions commonly below the hematite-magnetite buffer (Ohmoto, 2003; Mucke and Cabral, 2005). Although the veins are mined out and structural relationships are no longer discernable in the field, we interpret that the breccias represent samples close to the wall rock contact based on the ubiquity of host rock clasts as illustrated in Fig. 12A. Conversely, the granular to massive magnetite ores do not contain any host rock fragments (Fig. 2G, H) and thus are speculated to occur in the central portions of the veins (Fig. 12B). Based on these observations, we argue that the brecciated ores formed at an early stage of the ore-genetic sequence at Shepherd Mountain when an Fe-rich hydrothermal fluid infiltrated the volcanic host rocks and created veins that entrained clasts from the wall rock. The clasts were cemented by early specularite that precipitated from a hydrothermal fluid (Fig. 11); the temperature of this hydrothermal fluid is constrained by the formation temperature of specularite, i.e., 100\u00a0\u00b0C to 460\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g., Catling and Moore, 2003; Cabral and Rosi\u00e8re, 2013; Childress et al., 2020). Our model for the formation of the brecciated ore is consistent with the observations by Kisvarsanyi (1966) who proposed that the iron oxides were deposited contemporaneously with the fault systems resulting in the breccia ores. It is noted that, at this stage, specularite, with its characteristic needle-like habit, was likely the first iron oxide mineral to precipitate from the oxidized fluid, but subsequently was reduced to mushketovite during a later pulse of hotter ore fluid and\/or drop in a redox state (Fig. 11). Similar reductions of early specularite to later mushketovite are common in iron ore systems such as IOCG (e.g., Marschik and Fontbot\u00e9, 2001; De Haller and Fontbot\u00e9, 2009; Rieger et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2020a) and skarn deposits (e.g., Boni et al., 1990; D\u00fcnkel, 2002; Ciobanu and Cook, 2004; Prendergast et al., 2005) and are generally attributed to magmatic-hydrothermal processes.\nThe mushketovite at Shepherd Mountain shows patchy zoning patterns with dark and bright domains wherein the dark domains are characterized by elevated Si, Ca, and Al while the bright domains contain negligible amount of these elements based on x-ray mapping and EMPA results (Fig. 4B, 5A; ESM-1). The dark mushketovite domains with elevated Si, Al, and Ca contents overprint the bright domains (Fig. 4B, 5A); the overprinting might have been contemporaneous with the later-stage formation of high-Si granular magnetite in the central portion of the veins as further discussed in the next section, similar to processes observed for the Mina Justa IOCG deposit, Peru (Hu et al., 2020b).\nThe alteration assemblage in the brecciated ores at Shepherd Mountain gives insight into the temperature of the early specularite forming hydrothermal event. The breccias are characterized by potassic (K-feldspar) alteration and notably do not show any sign of sodic (albite) alteration. The potassic alteration is closely associated with Fe metasomatism (as implied by the early specularite formation) and silicification which generally records cooling of high temperature saline fluids in the H2O-NaCl-KCl-FeCl2 system degassed from a magma at temperatures between 250 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C (Giggenbach, 1984; De Haller and Fontbot\u00e9, 2009; Williams et al., 2005; Barton, 2014). Consequently, we argue that the early specularite at Shepherd Mountain formed from a saline hydrothermal fluid at a temperature between 250 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C. Later infiltration by a hotter magmatic-hydrothermal fluid (>400\u00a0\u00b0C as discussed below) triggered mushketovitization due to a decrease in a redox state below the hematite-magnetite buffer.\n\n\n5.1.2\nOrigin of the massive magnetite ores: Textural and compositional characteristics of high-Si vs. low-Si magnetite\nThe texture and trace element chemistry of magnetite and its compositional variations can be useful in constraining the ore-forming environments and discriminating between different styles of mineralization (Dupuis and Beaudoin, 2011; Dare et al., 2012, 2014; Nadoll et al., 2014). At Shepherd Mountain, two different types of granular magnetite exist that allow us to better constrain the massive ore forming events after the early formation of specularite\/mushketovite in the brecciated contact ore. One type of granular magnetite displays distinct oscillatory zoned patterns (Fig. 4C, E, F), whereas the second type is largely homogenous (Fig. 4E, F, I). The oscillatory magnetite is notably darker in BSE images when compared to the homogenous magnetite (cf.\nFigs. 4, 5). Similar oscillatory zonation patterns, typical of Si-rich magnetite, are observed in several IOA and IOCG deposits (e.g., El Laco, El Romeral, Sossego, Salobo, Candelaria, and Los Colorados), and were shown to reflect rapid crystal growth from a compositionally fluctuating fluid rather than solely being related to variation in temperature and oxygen fugacity (Shore and Fowler, 1996; Reich et al., 2013; Dare et al., 2015; Deditius et al., 2018; Huang and Beaudoin, 2019). Consequently, the oscillatory zonation observed in the darker domains of magnetite at Shepherd Mountain likely implies that the magnetite grew rapidly from a compositionally fluctuating fluid.\nIt is noted that the oscillatory zoned magnetite has significantly higher concentrations of lithophile elements (i.e., Si, Al, Ca, and Mg) than the homogeneous low-Si magnetite that, as a consequence, is more Fe rich and therefore brighter in BSE images (Figs. 4,\u00a05,\u00a06,\u00a013\nA). High Si and Ca contents in magnetite are commonly attributed to magnetite precipitation from hydrothermal fluids (Shimazaki, 1998; Dare et al., 2014; Nadoll et al., 2014) because lithophile elements such as Si and Ca preferentially partition into silicates in evolved magmatic systems due to the low partitioning coefficients of Si (DSi\u00a0=\u00a00.0017) and Ca (DCa\u00a0=\u00a00.035) into magnetite (Dare et al., 2012). Accordingly, the elevated Si\u00a0+\u00a0Ca contents of the oscillatory zoned magnetite observed here (7,200\u201332,000\u00a0ppm Si\u00a0+\u00a0Ca) are indicative of hydrothermal magnetite, which is consistent with the indication from oscillatory zonation that the magnetite formed from a hydrothermal fluid.\nOscillatory zoned high-Si magnetite with elevated concentrations of Al, Ca, and Mg has been reported in magmatic-hydrothermal ore systems such as skarn and IOCG deposits wherein the formation temperature was shown to be at least 400\u00a0\u00b0C. For example, the silician magnetite reported at the Olympic Dam deposit marks the onset of hydrothermal activity and for which the formation temperature was inferred to be at least 400\u00a0\u00b0C (Ciobanu et al., 2019; Verdugo-Ihl et al., 2019). At skarn-type deposits, such as Makeng and Chengchao in China, high-Si magnetite grains were shown to form from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids during retrograde stages with formation temperatures of\u00a0>\u00a0450\u00a0\u00b0C (Hu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019). The trace element composition of high-Si magnetite further supports a high temperature hydrothermal formation, although the\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0\u00b0C proposed by Dare et al. (2014; cf.\nFig. 13A) appear to be too high for the Shepherd Mountain deposit. Based on the similarities between the oscillatory zoned high-Si magnetite at Shepherd Mountain and other magmatic-hydrothermal systems, we argue that the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid at Shepherd Mountain that formed the high-Si magnetite had temperatures of at least 400\u00a0\u00b0C and was possibly sourced from the same magma that facilitated the formation of the nearby PKM deposit as further discussed in section 5.5. A magmatic-hydrothermal origin for the high-Si magnetite is also supported by the elevated trace element concentrations within high-Si magnetite such as granitophile-group elements (Pb, W, Sn, Mo), HFSE (Ti, Nb, Sc), and REE\u00a0+\u00a0Y (Figs. 5,\u00a013A, E). It is noted that Nadoll et al. (2015) suggested that elevated P, REE, and Si contents in magnetite from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids may reflect the presence of apatite and\/or silicate micro- to nano-inclusions rather than presence of these elements as solid solution in the magnetite lattice. However, we did not observe any such inclusions during our time-resolved laser ablation ICP-MS analysis. Verdugo-Ihl et al. (2019) attributed relative enrichments of REE\u00a0+\u00a0Y and negligible Ni and Cr in silician magnetite at the Olympic Dam to percolation by granite-derived magmatic ore fluids. Elevated concentrations of Al, Mg, Ca, Fe and Si in the Olympic Dam silician magnetite were likely provided from the breakdown of feldspars and mafic minerals during fluid-wall rock interactions (Kontonikas-Charos et al., 2017) and\/or a granite-derived magmatic fluid (Ciobanu et al., 2019). We propose a similar scenario for Shepherd Mountain, wherein a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid with temperature\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C carried Fe and Si from a magma and ascended through the Ironton Fault (Fig. 12; Panno and Hood, 1983) and leached Al, Ca, and Mg from magmatic minerals (e.g., feldspars and biotite\/hornblende) during the ascension through the rhyolitic wall rocks (Fig. 12), thus facilitating the formation of high-Si magnetite that is further enriched in REE\u00a0+\u00a0Y, Pb, and Sc.\nWe suggest that the high-Si magnetite forming event is directly related to the mushketovite forming event discussed above. As a second, hotter magmatic-hydrothermal fluid infiltrated and widened the veins, it reduced the specularite to mushketovite due to a drop in the redox state and nucleated high-Si magnetite on the surface of mushketovite, resulting in the formation of the darker domains shown in Fig. 4B. Contemporaneously, the granular high-Si magnetite such as shown in Fig. 4C, F precipitated in the central portions of the veins upon widening. Similar processes, i.e., mushketovitization and subsequent overprinting with high-Si magnetite which are contemporaneous with the formation of high-Si granular magnetite in central parts of the deposit, were also observed at the Mina Justa IOCG deposit in Peru (Hu et al., 2020). The observations from Mina Justa support our speculation that the mushketovitization, followed by the overprinting with high-Si domains in the outer portions of the veins, and the contemporaneous formation of high-Si granular magnetite in the central parts of the veins, reflect the same hydrothermal fluid event with a temperature of\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAs opposed to the zoned high-Si magnetite, low-Si magnetite is homogeneous and displays dissolution-reprecipitation textures (Putnis, 2009; Putnis and John, 2010) by replacing the zoned magnetite with sharp and irregular contacts (bright domains in Fig. 4F). The dissolution-reprecipitation textures suggest that a third hydrothermal fluid(s) interacted with the zoned high-Si magnetite, locally dissolved it, and reprecipitated homogeneous secondary magnetite with higher Fe content. Replacement patterns with dissolution-reprecipitation textures generally reflect a mixture of magmatic ore fluids with surface-derived fluids as observed in several magmatic-hydrothermal iron ore systems such as the Makeng skarn Fe deposit in China, the Chadormalu IOA deposit in Iran, and the Mina Justa IOCG deposit in Peru (Heidarian et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2020b). Several factors may have triggered the dissolution-reprecipitation process, such as changes in temperature, pressure, pH, or oxygen fugacity. As the results of the dissolution-reprecipitation process, the secondary low-Si magnetite contains lesser amount of trace elements such as Si, Ca, Y, Pb, Zr, Hf, W, Sc, Ta, Nb, Sn, Ga, Mg, and Ti except for V (Fig. 13A) compared to the primary high-Si magnetite, which may have been due to a decrease in temperature, as temperature is one of the controlling factors of trace element partitioning into magnetite (Nadoll et al., 2014; Dare et al., 2014). In addition to temperature, the dissolution-reprecipitation process may also have been driven by fluctuations in fO2 which can be assessed via multi-valent element systematics, for example, V and Sn. The oxidation state of V in natural systems varies from 2\u00a0+\u00a0to 5+, with divalent V only being dominant in highly reducing environments (fo2 more reducing than IW buffer; Sutton et al., 2005; Shearer et al., 2006). Vanadium partitioning into magnetite is redox dependent with V3+ or V4+ being the most compatible species whereas V5+ (i.e., under higher oxygen fugacity) is incompatible in magnetite (Toplis and Corgne, 2002; Balan et al., 2006; Righter et al., 2006). Vanadium concentrations in low-Si magnetite (10\u2013110\u00a0ppm\u00a0V) from Shepherd Mountain are slightly higher than in the high-Si magnetite (0.7\u201366\u00a0ppm\u00a0V; Fig. 6). Therefore, the increase of V in the low-Si magnetite from Shepherd Mountain may imply a decrease in oxygen fugacity when compared to the stage when the high-Si magnetite formed. Lower Sn contents in the low-Si magnetite (0.1\u20131.1\u00a0ppm Sn) compared to the high-Si magnetite (1\u20136\u00a0ppm Sn; Fig. 6A) also support such a decrease in oxygen fugacity at Shepherd Mountain because Sn4+ (with 4\u00a0+\u00a0valence state at\u00a0>\u00a0FMQ\u00a0+\u00a03 buffer) substitutes more easily for Fe3+ in magnetite under more oxidizing condition (Linnen et al., 1996; Carew, 2004; Barkov et al., 2008). Therefore, the lower Sn contents in low-Si magnetite likely represent a decrease in fO2. Overall, the dissolution-reprecipitation process that formed the low-Si magnetite was likely triggered through late-stage mixing with a third surface-derived, lower temperature meteoric water with an fO2 lower than the high-Si magnetite forming hydrothermal fluid.\nIn summary, our textural and mineral-chemical observations suggest that at least two generations of magnetite exist that formed after the early precipitation of specularite at the Shepherd Mountain deposit (Fig. 11). The high-Si magnetite formed from a high temperature magmatic-hydrothermal fluid (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) with a fluctuating composition that facilitated the formation of the oscillatory zonation. Percolation of the fluid through the rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs (Fig. 8A) and minor intermediate volcanic rocks (Panno and Hood, 1983) caused a breakdown of magmatic minerals such as feldspars, biotite and hornblende in the host rocks and provided Al, Ca, and Mg to the ore-forming fluid while Fe and Si may have been extracted from the magma with the exsolving fluid. In contrast, the low-Si magnetite formed through dissolution-reprecipitation processes at temperatures lower than the high-Si magnetite formation temperature upon mixing with a third, likely meteoric, water source.\n\n5.1.2.1\nFormation of late stage martite and specularite at the Shepherd Mountain deposit\nHematite in the Shepherd Mountain deposit occurs as martitic hematite partially replacing magnetite and mushketovite (Fig. 4A-H), and as late specularite with elongated laths both in breccia and massive ores (Fig. 4C, F, H). It is noted that the specularite discussed in this section is different from the early formed specularite that is fully replaced by mushketovite.\n\nMartite: Martitic alteration of magnetite occurs selectively, often following the colloform texture of magnetite, as shown in Fig. 4D, as well as along d111\n planes of magnetite as shown in Fig. 4H. The selective martitic alteration was likely caused by a fourth fluid that affected primarily magnetite with low Si, Ca, Al, and Mg concentrations, because high-Si magnetite was demonstrated to be more resistant to martitization based on observations from other locations, such as the Copiapo Nordeste IOCG prospect (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2018) and the Hamersley BIF (Huberty et al., 2012). The presence of pores and cracks in martite (Figs. 4, 5) suggests that the martitic alteration likely reflects a non-redox transformation, i.e., an interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation reaction (ICDR). During the ICDR process, Fe2+ is removed from the crystal structure of magnetite which results in a volume decrease of 33% (Zhao et al., 2019; Xing et al., 2021) and thus creates pore space. Conversely, redox transformation of magnetite to hematite would have resulted in a volume increase by 1.66% (Xing et al., 2021) which is not consistent with the petrographic observations that are indicative of grain shrinkage rather than volume increase (Fig. 4A, D, G). Martitization via non-redox reactions is further supported by the indistinguishable concentrations of V and Sn between magnetite (10 \u2013 110\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, 0.1 \u2013 1.1\u00a0ppm Sn) and martite (30 \u2013 86\u00a0ppm\u00a0V, 0.07 \u2013 0.6\u00a0ppm Sn), which, due to the redox-sensitive nature of V and Sn discussed above, is indicative of relatively constant redox conditions (Swann and Tighe, 1977; Ohmoto, 2003; Huang et al., 2019). A comparison between the mineral chemistry of martite and the low-Si magnetite it replaces shows that the trace element contents remain relatively constant during the replacement process, with the exception of Pb, W, and REE, which are slightly elevated in martitic hematite (Fig. 13A, B). The retention of pristine trace element abundances during martitization was shown to occur at moderate temperatures of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b0C (Sidhu et al., 1981; Angerer et al., 2012). The minor additions of Pb, W, and REE indicate that the late-stage fourth fluid was enriched in these elements upon percolation through the rhyolitic\/dacitic and intermediate composition volcanic rocks.\n\nSpecularite: Textural relationships suggest that specularite at Shepherd Mountain is a late stage phase as its occurrence is restricted to open spaces (Fig. 4C, F, H). However, petrographic observations do not allow us to constrain which formed first, i.e., martitic replacement or specularite formation. Specularite is characterized by greater concentrations of Zr, Hf, Sc, Ta, Nb, Mo, Sn, W, Ti, Mg, and Al when compared to martite (Fig. 13B). Moreover, C1 chondrite normalized REE patterns show lower concentrations of REE in specularite compared to those in martite (Fig. 13F). The differences in composition between martite and specularite suggest that the two hematite groups formed from different fluids, thus implying the presence of a fifth, specularite-forming fluid pulse with a temperature of at least 100\u00a0\u00b0C and up to 460\u00a0\u00b0C based on the formation temperature of specularite (e.g., Catling and Moore, 2003; Childress et al., 2020). Elevated HFSE contents in specularite (Fig. 13B) imply that the late-stage specularite-forming ore fluid was F-bearing because F ligands tend to increase HFSE solubility and thus are considered to be critical for transporting HFSE (Montreuil et al., 2016). The presence of a F-bearing fluid is consistent with field observations that identified cross-cutting fluorite veinlets at Shepherd Mountain (cf.\nNold et al., 2014).\n\n\n5.1.2.2\nConstraints on fluid(s) from Fe isotope compositions\nIron isotopic signatures as possible tracers of geological processes have been broadly applied to constrain ore-forming processes for magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal (Wawryk, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Knipping et al., 2019), hydrothermal (Graham et al., 2004; Markl et al., 2006), and sedimentary deposits (Frost et al., 2007; Mendes et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2020b). The \u03b456Fe values of mushketovite, which occurs in the brecciated ore (Fig. 2E, F; 4A, B), are \u22120.55\u2030 and \u22120.14\u2030 (Fig. 7) with an average of \u22120.35\u2030. These isotopic signatures likely reflect (i) the formation of the initial specularite from a low temperature (<400\u00a0\u00b0C) hydrothermal fluid (Wang et al., 2011; Troll et al., 2019) which is in agreement with the above suggested formation temperature (250\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 400\u00a0\u00b0C), and (ii) the subsequent replacement of specularite by the mushketovite. The petrographic observations discussed above suggest that the mushketovite formed through a dissolution-reprecipitation process in which the primary specularite was reduced to magnetite due to the introduction of a prograde hotter, reducing fluid (Fig. 4A, B). The dissolution and reprecipitation process likely caused a shift toward a lighter Fe isotopic composition because, during dissolution processes, lighter isotopes preferentially partition into fluids which will result in reprecipitation of products from the fluid with lighter Fe isotope compositions (e.g., Weiss, 2013; Troll et al., 2019). The decrease in Fe isotopic values during the dissolution and reprecipitation process is consistent with the reduction process that is required for mushketovite formation as reduction is commonly considered to fractionate Fe towards lighter compositions (Markl et al., 2006).\nThe \u03b456Fe values of the magnetite from Shepherd Mountain are \u22120.26\u2030 and \u22120.15\u2030 (Fig. 7) with an average of \u22120.21\u2030. These values are slightly higher compared to that of mushketovite, but lower than the reported \u03b456Fe values of magnetite from the deeper-seated PKM deposit (0.06\u2030 \u2013 0.27\u2030; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021). The heavier Fe isotopic signatures of Shepherd Mountain magnetite, compared to that of mushketovite, may have resulted from the higher formation temperature (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) of the high-Si magnetite as temperature has been shown to be a controlling factor for Fe isotope fractionation in magmatic-hydrothermal systems (Knipping et al., 2019; Troll et al., 2019). Magnetite also shows dissolution and reprecipitation textures in which the partial dissolution of high-Si magnetite resulted in the formation of secondary low-Si magnetite (Fig. 4D, E, F, I). Analogous to the mushketovite, the dissolution and reprecipitation process may have lowered the Fe isotope compositions to negative values. In addition to the dissolution and reprecipitation process, the lighter Fe isotopic composition of magnetite from Shepherd Mountain compared to PKM likely also reflects a temperature dependent fractionation of Fe isotopes during fluid ascent through the Ironton Fault during which heavier isotope were left behind and the cooling ascending fluid was therefore progressively enriched in lighter isotopes (Markl et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Troll et al., 2019).\nAs opposed to mushketovite and magnetite, the late-stage specularite that formed in open spaces does not show dissolution-reprecipitation textures (Fig. 4F) and has \u03b456Fe values of \u22120.19\u2030 and \u22120.07\u2030 with an average of \u22120.13\u2030 (Fig. 7). These values are slightly heavier compared to the Fe isotope composition of magnetite and mushketovite at Shepherd Mountain. It is plausible to infer that the ore fluid that formed the late stage specularite had a lighter isotopic signature than the specularite itself as because Markl et al. (2006) showed that hematite that precipitates from an oxidizing fluid has a heavier isotopic signature than the original fluid. The presence of an isotopically light hydrothermal fluid (\u03b456Fe\u00a0<\u00a0-0.19\u2030 to \u22120.07\u2030; i.e., the specularite range) may reflect either a temperature depended fractionation of Fe isotopes during fluid and\/or fluid mixing with isotopically lighter meteoric water as discussed above for the formation of specularite.\nIn summary, we argue that the Fe isotope compositions of mushketovite, magnetite, and specularite from the Shepherd Mountain deposit, that formed during different fluid pulses and due to dissolution and reprecipitation processes, reflect a range of processes, including formation temperature, fractionation of Fe isotopes during the ascent of magmatic-hydrothermal fluid through the Ironton Fault, and possibly fluid-mixing with surface-derived meteoric water.\n\n\n5.1.2.3\nSummary for the formation of the Shepherd Mountain deposit\nAlthough the Shepherd Mountain ore veins are mined out and stratigraphic relationships are difficult to constrain, we propose that that the breccia ores represent the outer portions of the veins owing to the abundance of wall-rock clasts in the brecciated samples. Conversely, the massive\/granular magnetite vein ore does not contain wall rock clasts and consequently is interpreted to represent the central portion of the vein (Fig. 12). The veining and iron oxide mineralization are suggested to have formed through the following processes: specularite was the first mineral to precipitate from an oxidizing magmatic-hydrothermal fluid above the hematite-magnetite buffer at a temperature between 250 and 400\u00a0\u00b0C when a high-pressure fluid infiltrated the rhyolitic host rock, opening two initially narrow veins and creating a brecciated texture due to high fluid pressure. The Ironton Fault (Panno and Hood, 1983) may have provided a preferred path for fluid ascent. A second pulse of magmatic-hydrothermal ore fluid with a higher temperature (>400\u00a0\u00b0C) caused a decrease in local oxygen fugacity and the replacement of specularite by mushketovite while preserving the primary specularite texture. The second fluid pulse also widened the veins and caused precipitation of granular, oscillatory-zoned high-Si magnetite wherein the zonation reflects compositional fluctuation of the fluid during percolation. Mixing with surface-derived meteoric waters (third fluid) led to a decrease in temperature and oxygen fugacity which may have promoted the dissolution-reprecipitation process and resulted in the formation of homogeneous low-Si magnetite by replacing high-Si primary magnetite. The low-Si magnetite was subsequently replaced by martite, likely upon draw down of meteoric water (fourth fluid) that caused fluid-mineral reactions at a temperature of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b0C. A final, fifth pulse of F-bearing fluid facilitated the formation of late specularite in open spaces at temperatures\u00a0>\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b0C, possibly up to 460\u00a0\u00b0C. The origin of the fluids and implications for the formation of the Shepherd Mountain deposit within the geodynamic framework of the SE Missouri metallogenic province are discussed in the following section.\n\n\n\n\n5.2\nGenetic link between the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob magnetite deposits\nThe Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob iron ore systems are nearby (i.e., \u223c1000\u00a0m; Fig. 1C) and were emplaced in the same\/similar volcanic rocks as shown in Figs. 8, 9. Therefore, it would be plausible that the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob Magnetite (PKM) deposits are both local expressions of the same magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal plumbing system. Such a link was previously speculated based on their proximity to one another (Nold et al., 2014), but no geological and\/or geochemical studies were conducted to test such a hypothesis. Here we compare whole rock and mineral chemistry data from Shepherd Mountain and PKM (new magnetite LA-ICP-MS data and previously published whole rock data from Tunnell et al. (2021) and Day et al. (2017)) to assess if the two deposits are genetically related.\n\n5.2.1\nInsights from iron ore whole-rock chemistry\nThe Pilot Knob Magnetite deposit has been shown to be magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal in origin (Fig. 12C), i.e., it is composed of a massive magmatic magnetite ore body in the deeper portion of the deposit that transitions into disseminated magmatic-hydrothermal ore towards shallower levels (Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021). It is noted that the magmatic origin for the PKM deposit is not fully constrained. For example, an immiscible sodic syenite magma source, as previously suggested by Nold et al. (2013), would be consistent with an emplacement of the PKM deposit in a post-collisional setting (Watts and Mercer, 2020; Tunnell et al., 2021) due to the alkaline nature of magmas that can be expected in such an environment (e.g., Locmelis et al. 2016; Fiorentini et al., 2018; Holwell et al., 2019; Locmelis et al. 2021). However, it is noted that albite in the PKM deposit, which was used to support a syenite magma by Nold et al. (2013), may not necessarily be magmatic\/syenitic (Day et al., 2016). Therefore, the magma may have been not syenitic, but perhaps either a silicate melt, as proposed for the Pea Ridge and Bourbon deposits in southeastern Missouri close to Shepherd Mountain (Fig. 1B; Watts and Mercer, 2020), or a more intermediate\/andesitic magma as proposed for IOA\/IOCG systems in southeast Missouri (Meighan et al., 2019a) and elsewhere (e.g., Simon et al., 2018). The shallower magmatic-hydrothermal magnetite was likely deposited from magmatic ore fluids that were exsolved from the magma that formed the magmatic portion of the deposit (Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021). The exsolved ore fluids precipitated magnetite by replacing the unwelded sections of an ash-flow tuff and formed a tabular body that is subparallel to the host rock layering within the volcanic sequence (Panno and Hood, 1983).\nIron oxide-mineralized samples from the Pilot Knob Magnetite (13\u201389\u00a0wt% Fe2O3) and Shepherd Mountain (47\u201397\u00a0wt% Fe2O3) deposits display similar whole rock patterns in C1 chondrite-normalized and BSE-normalized spidergrams and are notably enriched in LREE (Fig. 10). The bulk compositional similarity of ores between the two deposits may indicate that these two deposits are genetically related. In such a scenario, ore fluid(s) derived from the magma that formed the PKM deposit at depth ascended and utilized the Ironton Fault as a preferred fluid pathway, forming the Shepherd Mountain deposit at a higher stratigraphic level as illustrated in Fig. 12.\n\n5.2.1.1\nInsights from magnetite chemistry\nThe compositional similarities in the whole rock ore composition between the Pilot Knob Magnetite and Shepherd Mountain deposit are, at least to some extent, also observed in the magnetite chemistry. It is noted that the low-Si magnetite is a product of dissolution and reprecipitation processes that was not observed at PKM; therefore, the low-Si magnetite is not compared to magnetite from PKM.\nLaser ablation ICP-MS analyses of magnetite from PKM and high-Si magnetite from Shepherd Mountain show similar trace element patterns and abundances with respect to Cr, Ni, Mn, Ga, Sn, Nb, Ta, and Ge (Fig. 6A; 13A, C). However, several differences in the trace element composition of magnetite are observed, most notably Ti and V that are depleted in magnetite from Shepherd Mountain, and Si, Ca, Mg and Al that are notably enriched (Fig. 13C). Such compositional variabilities can be expected if the Shepherd Mountain deposit is a surface-near expression of the same plumbing system that formed the PKM deposit at depth due to differences in temperature, redox conditions and draw down of meteoric water which can result in a dilution of elements and cooling of the high T hydrothermal fluids.\nIt is a notable observation that magnetite from the PKM deposit contains between 70 and 3,500\u00a0ppm Ti, of which the higher end values come from deeper (i.e., presumably higher temperature) samples (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the Ti content in high-Si magnetite from the Shepherd Mountain deposit is distinctly lower (15\u2013550\u00a0ppm Ti). It is noted that the Ti range reported here for both deposits (15\u20133,500\u00a0ppm Ti) falls within the global range for hydrothermal magnetite (15 \u2013 3,560\u00a0ppm; Nadoll et al., 2015). In contrast, magmatic magnetite has been proposed to contain overall higher contents globally between 70 and 67,100\u00a0ppm (Dare et al., 2014; Nadoll et al., 2015; Duparc et al., 2016). Although the Ti contents in magnetite from the PKM and Shepherd Mountain deposits are in the lower range for Ti contents globally, the overlap between the hydrothermal and magmatic ranges does not allow to fully discriminate between magmatic and hydrothermal magnetite solely based on Ti contents. However, when integrated with Ni\/Cr contents the magnetite composition indicates a hydrothermal origin (Fig. 14\n; Dare et al., 2014). The significantly lower Ti contents in magnetite from the Shepherd Mountain deposit may reflect ore formation from ascending, cooling hydrothermal fluids when compared to higher temperature magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal magnetite from the PKM deposit (Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al. 2021) as Ti contents in magnetite decrease with decreasing temperature (Dare et al., 2014; Nadoll et al., 2014). It is noted that magnetite formation temperature calculations using the empirical Mg geothermometry proposed by Canil and Lacourse (2020) were not feasible due to the significant hydrothermal and chemical weathering of magnetite in the Pilot Knob Magnetite and Shepherd Mountain deposits, which has been shown to result in inaccurate temperature calculations (Palma et al., 2021)\nThe V contents of high-Si magnetite from Shepherd Mountain (0.7\u201366.4\u00a0ppm\u00a0V) are overall lower when compared to the PKM deposit (36\u2013343\u00a0ppm\u00a0V; Fig. 6A, 13C). The differences in V contents between the two deposits likely reflect that the fluid that formed Shepherd Mountain was more oxidizing and cooler compared to that at PKM owing to the redox sensitive and temperature dependent nature of V. As mentioned previously, V is more compatible to magnetite under reducing and hotter conditions, which can explain higher V contents as observed in PKM. A similar redox and temperature control on magnetite can also be observed within the PKM deposit (ESM-3) because samples retrieved from 620 to 667\u00a0m depth are characterized by 80\u2013343\u00a0ppm\u00a0V while shallower samples from 137 to 177\u00a0m depth contain between 36 and 102\u00a0ppm\u00a0V (and 0.7\u201366.4\u00a0ppm\u00a0V at Shepherd Mountain). Based on these observations, we speculate that magnetite at deeper levels in the PKM deposit formed from a reducing and hotter fluid(s) that became progressively oxidized and cooler upon ascent, resulting in the low V concentrations in the shallower level PKM ore as well as in the surface-near Shepherd Mountain deposit. The progressive decrease in V contents in magnetite with decreasing depth, and, by inference, oxidation and cooling of the ore fluid during ascend, is consistent with a physio-chemical connection between the Pilot Knob and Shepherd Mountain deposits within the same plumbing system. In such a context, the elevated Ca, Al, and Mg concentration in the Shepherd Mountain high-Si magnetite likely reflect scavenging of these elements from feldspars, biotite, or hornblende of the wall rock, whereas Fe and Si were extracted from the magma during the exsolution of a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid that ascended through the Ironton Fault. The elevated concentrations of REE\u00a0+\u00a0Y within high-Si magnetite from Shepherd Mountain compared to magnetite in PKM (Fig. 13E) may also have resulted from scavenging REE and Y from wall rocks. Alternatively, REE and Y may have originated from the ore fluid exsolved from the magma at depth (i.e., together with Fe and Si) and remained in the ascending magmatic-hydrothermal fluid(s) because the rare earth elements are classified as non-spinel elements and thus would not have partitioned into magnetite at deeper levels (Nadoll et al., 2014).\nIn summary, our laser ablation ICP-MS data of magnetite from the Shepherd Mountain and PKM deposits indicate that these two deposits have a shared origin based on similar trace element patterns and abundances, most notably Cr, Mn, Ga, Sn, Nb, Ta, and Ge. Differences in Ti, V, Si, Ca, Al, Mg, and REE contents imply that the temperature of the ore forming fluid(s) decreased with decreasing depth while the fluid(s) became more oxidized. An increase in Si, Ca, Al, and Mg contents in magnetite at Shepherd Mountain likely reflects assimilation of these elements from the wall rock during ascent along the Ironton Fault and, integrated with the other discussed trace elements characteristics, may imply that the Pilot Knob Magnetite and Shepherd Mountain deposits are part of the same magmatic-hydrothermal plumbing system.\n\n\n5.2.1.2\nInsights from hematite chemistry\nThe elevated HFSE concentrations in hematite and late specularite in the PKM and Shepherd Mountain deposits, respectively, can also give insight into a possible genetic link between the two deposits (Fig. 6B, C; 13B, D). These hematites are compared because textural relationships suggest that they form during similar late stages within the respective ore formation. Hematite from the PKM deposit is characterized by high Ti concentrations between 25,000\u201348,000\u00a0ppm Ti, which is significantly higher when compared to that in other iron oxides in the PKM deposit (i.e., up to 3,500\u00a0ppm; Fig. 6B, C; 13D). It is noted that the Pilot Knob Hematite deposit (PKH), which is located 240\u00a0m stratigraphically above the PKM and was shown to be part of the same magmatic-hydrothermal plumbing system as the PKM deposit, is also characterized by high-Ti hematite (<120\u00a0ppm up to 26,800\u00a0ppm; Tunnell et al., 2021). In comparison, the late-stage specularite from the Shepherd Mountain deposit (Fig. 11) contains between 130 and 4,200\u00a0ppm Ti, which is also significantly higher when compared to other iron oxides (i.e., up to 550\u00a0ppm Ti) in Shepherd Mountain (ESM-1). Based on the elevated Ti concentrations, an argument can be made that the specularite and hematite from Shepherd Mountain and PKM, respectively, precipitated from the same Ti-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluid wherein Ti was mobilized as F and Cl complexes as previously suggested for the PKH deposit (Tunnell et al., 2021). The presence of a F-bearing magmatic-hydrothermal fluid is supported by abundant fluorite in the PKM deposit (Nold et al., 2013) as well as fluorite-rich veinlets at Shepherd Mountain (Nold et al., 2014). Analogous to the Ti contents in magnetite, the lower Ti contents in hematite from the Shepherd Mountain and PKH deposits may be indicative of a cooling ore fluid closer to the surface.\nIn addition to Ti concentrations, both hematite from the PKM deposit and specularite from the Shepherd Mountain deposit are characterized by elevated HFSE (Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb) and W, Sn, and Sc contents when compared to other iron oxide minerals in these deposits (Fig. 13B, D, ESM-1), which may have been sourced from a granitic melt through fluid exsolution as suggested by Meighan et al. (2019b). High field strength elements are commonly considered to be conservative, but several studies have shown that HFSE can be mobilized in a wide range of P-T conditions and their solubility is generally enhanced at high pH conditions and with increasing F contents of the fluids (Vard and Williams-Jones, 1993; Jiang, 2000; Jiang et al., 2005). The mobility of HFSE in F-bearing fluid is in agreement with the observation above that a F-bearing fluid was likely important in the formation of hematite at Pilot Knob and Shepherd Mountain based on the presence of fluorite. The F-bearing fluid also might have collected Ti from a breakdown of mafic minerals and\/or hydrothermal rutile that exists in the deeper portions of the PKM deposit (Tunnell et al., 2021). Owing to the elevated Ti, HFSE, W, Sn and Sc contents of hematite from the PKM and Shepherd Mountain deposits, we argue that the same (and\/or a similar) F-bearing fluid event formed late stage hematite\/specularite both in the PKM and Shepherd Mountain deposits.\n\n\n5.2.1.3\nInsight from Fe isotope compositions\nAs illustrated in Fig. 7, a decrease in \u03b456Fe signatures is observed in iron oxides from the PKM deposit (heaviest \u03b456Fe values) to the PKH deposit and Shepherd Mountain deposit (lightest \u03b456Fe values). The decreasing trend in \u03b456Fe signatures corresponds to the stratigraphic level of individual deposits as the Shepherd Mountain deposit is located at the stratigraphically highest level whereas PKM is the deepest deposit (e.g., Panno and Hood 1983; Day et al. 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021). We argue that the lighter isotopic signature of magnetite from Shepherd Mountain (i.e., average of \u03b456Fe\u00a0=\u00a0-0.20\u2030 in average) compared to magnetite from PKM (average of \u03b456Fe\u00a0=\u00a00.17\u2030; Childress et al. 2016; Tunnell et al. 2021) reflects the temperature dependent fractionation of Fe isotopes during the progressive evolution from magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal conditions during ascent of the ore fluid through the Ironton Fault. Consequently, the iron isotope signatures of magnetite from Shepherd Mountain and PKM are in agreement with the hypothesis that both deposits were physiochemically connected. We note that no systematic relationship exists between the Fe isotope composition and the trace element composition of the analyzed iron oxide minerals. The absence of a correlation is not surprising, however, as the primary trace element composition of iron oxide minerals is readily modified by hydrothermal processes and chemical weathering (Wen et al., 2017), whereas the Fe isotope composition has been shown to be less susceptible to modification (Childress et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021).\nBecause the PKM and PKH deposits were shown to be two endmembers of a magmatic to magmatic-hydrothermal continuum (Tunnell et al., 2021), it can be inferred that the Shepherd Mountain deposit is also genetically related to the PKH deposit. In such a scenario, the near-surface Shepherd Mountain and PKH deposits may be hydrodynamically linked through the PKM deposit at depth as illustrated in Fig. 12. The iron isotopic data support such a model as the late-stage specularite from the Shepherd Mountain deposit has a \u03b456Fe average value of \u22120.13\u2030 which is lighter than \u03b456Fe values measured for hematite from the PKH deposit (-0.19\u2030 to 0.30\u2030 with an average of 0.08\u2030; Tunnell et al., 2021). The lighter Fe isotopic signature of specularite from Shepherd Mountain likely reflects its emplacement at a higher stratigraphic level which caused more extensive fractionation of Fe isotopes during fluid ascend compared to the PKH deposit. The model for the formation of the Shepherd Mountain and PKM and PKH deposits is further discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n5.3\nModel for a genetic link between the Shepherd Mountain and Pilot Knob magnetite deposits\nBased on the spatial proximity between the Shepherd Mountain and PKM deposit, field and petrographic observations, geochemical data and stable Fe isotope compositions presented here, we propose that both deposits are local expressions of the same magmatic-hydrothermal plumbing system as illustrated in Fig. 12C. The massive magnetite in the deeper part of the PKM deposit formed from a sodic magnetite syenitic (Nold et al., 2013) or possibly silicate (Watts and Mercer, 2020; Simon et al., 2018) magma and transitioned to disseminated magnetite formed from a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid that exsolved from the magma as previously proposed by Panno and Hood (1983) and Nold et al. (2013). The magmatic-hydrothermal portions of the PKM deposit formed by replacing the unwelded portions of the host ash-flow tuff towards shallower levels (cf.\nPanno and Hood, 1983). The magmatic crystallization and replacement of permeable ash-flow tuff by Fe-rich ore fluid formed a tabular body that is subparallel to the bedding of the volcanic sequence (Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021). To the northeast of the PKM deposit, the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid ascended further, likely along the Pilot Knob Fault, and formed the PKH deposit by replacing bedded and brecciated volcanic sequence (Tunnell et al., 2021). However, it is noted that the Pilot Knob Fault, which existence was proposed by Panno and Hood (1983), is not exposed. To the southwest of the PKM deposit, several pulses of ore-forming fluid (Fig. 12) ascended along the Ironton Fault, which predates the PKM iron mineralization (Panno and Hood, 1983) and formed the vein-type Shepherd Mountain deposit from hydrothermal fluids as well as meteoric waters as discussed above. In the proposed model, the Fe in all three deposits (Shepherd Mountain, PKM, PKH) is sourced from the same magma, but Fe deposited through different ore-forming processes as a result of different emplacement styles and depths in a common ore-forming system, i.e., vein-hosted (Shepherd Mountain, this study) vs. ash-flow tuff replacement at depth (PKM, Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013) vs. replacement of bedded and brecciated volcano-sedimentary rocks near the surface (PKH; Tunnell et al., 2021).\nThis scenario is depicted in Fig. 12 in which the deeper magmatic portion of the PKM deposit was derived from a deeper magma chamber (not yet intercepted by drill cores) whereas the shallower portion of the PKM deposit formed from ore fluids exsolved from the magma, with some involvement of surface-derived fluids (Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013; Childress et al., 2016; Tunnell et al., 2021). The Shepherd Mountain and PKH deposits formed from ascending magmatic ore fluids along the faults and represent shallow parts of a single plumbing system. It is noted that dikes of andesitic and aplitic composition are identified in the PKM deposit (Fig. 12), besides the Shepherd Mountain gabbro dike (Panno and Hood, 1983; Nold et al., 2013), that were emplaced at least prior to the last Fe mineralization event; however, its contribution to the ore-forming processes remains to be understood (Panno and Hood, 1983).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study investigated the vein-type Shepherd Mountain Fe oxide deposit in the Southeast Missouri Iron Metallogenic Province and its genetic relationship to the Pilot Knob Magnetite and Pilot Knob Hematite deposits. Our findings show that:\n\n-\nThe Shepherd Mountain deposit formed from at least five pulses of magmatic-hydrothermal fluid.\n\n\n-\nThe mineralization sequence is defined as: (1) Early specularite in the brecciated margins; (2) Mushketovitization of specularite and contemporaneous formation of high-Si magnetite in the center of the veins, both as overgrowths on mushketovite and granular magnetite; (3) Formation of low-Si magnetite following the dissolution of high-Si magnetite and low-Si magnetite reprecipitation; (4) Martitic alteration of magnetite; and (5) Late-stage specularite formation.\n\n\n-\nThe Pilot Knob Magnetite, Pilot Knob Hematite and Shepherd Mountain deposits are local expressions of the same magmatic-hydrothermal plumbing system connected through local faults.\n\n\n\n\n","52":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Variscan belt in western Europe, which extends from the Iberian Peninsula to the Bohemian massif (Fig. 1\n, is a well-known metallogenic province that hosts several types of world-class Au, Cu-Zn, W-Sn, U deposits that have been mined over two centuries (e.g.,\nMarignac and Cuney, 1999; Bouchot et al., 2005; Romer and Kroner, 2018). Gold mineralization is a prominent feature of the European Variscan belt, especially in the NW part of the Iberian Massif (Fig. 1-A).\nSeveral types of hydrothermal gold deposits have been identified in Iberia, including different types of skarns (e.g., Rio Narcea belt: Mart\u0131n-Izard et al., 2000; Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2000; Cepedal et al., 2000, Cepedal et al., 2006), Carlin-like deposits (e.g., Salam\u00f3n and El Valle: Crespo et al., 2000; Cepedal et al., 2008), orogenic gold systems (e.g., Corcoesto: Boiron et al., 1996, 2003; Llamas de Cabrera: G\u00f3mez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012; Tomi\u00f1o: Urbano et al., 1998; Limarinho: Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016; Penedono: Neiva et al., 2019; and Castromil: Vallance et al., 2003) and intrusion-related gold systems (e.g., Salave: Rodr\u00edguez-Terente et al., 2018, and Linares: Cepedal et al., 2013).\nThe association of several important gold deposits in the NW portion of the Iberian Massif with their hosted granitic intrusions is evident (e.g., in Portuguese deposits: Jales, Ponte da Barca, Penedono, Castromil, Bigorne, Limarinho; Fig. 1-B-C).\nAvailable fluid inclusion data from Jales, Penedono, Castromil, and Limarinho gold-bearing quartz-sulfide veins reveal both metamorphic and meteoric fluids, but gold was mainly introduced during a meteoric fluids late influx (Noronha et al., 2000; Boiron et al., 2003; Vallance et al., 2003). One of the primary controls on gold mineralization in the Iberian deposits is the late introduction of gold in the paragenetic sequence and the apparent structural and spatial association with regional structures related to the late Variscan deformation episodes (Noronha et al., 2000). Most of these deposits have been considered as orogenic gold systems (OGS) (e.g.,\nMackenzie et al., 2019), although the Jales deposit is somewhat more equivocal: it has been classified as an intrusion-related gold system (IRGS) (Rosa, 2001), but the available Pb isotope data are not consistent with this classification.\nCarboniferous synorogenic collisional (325\u2013315\u00a0Ma) and late to- post-orogenic (ca. 305\u2013290\u00a0Ma) magmatism is a prominent feature in the Central Iberian Zone (e.g., Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2018) and these include a wide diversity of granite types (Fig. 1-B). These include peraluminous S-type, as well as I-type and hybrid granites, including rare metaluminous varieties and granites with transitional features between S and I-type (Dias et al.,1998; Castro et al., 2002; Bea et al., 2003; Neiva et al.,2009; Teixeira et al.,2011; Villaseca et al., 2012; Mart\u00ednez-Catal\u00e1n et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2018).\nAvailable geochronological data for some gold deposits in the Iberian Massif yield ages between 305 and 290\u00a0Ma. OGS (Jales, Penedono, and Castromil deposits) are partially or wholly hosted in the synorogenic granites (age range: ca. 320 to 305\u00a0Ma; Rosa, 2001; Lima et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2018; Neiva et al., 2019) and mineralized structures post-date them. The IRGS (Salave, Linares, and the Rio Narcea deposits) are related to the post-orogenic granitoid suite (ca. 298\u2013295\u00a0Ma) (Mortensen et al., 2014), which intrude all the structural domains of the orogen. No gold deposits hosted in post-orogenic granites have been recognized so far in Portugal.\nThe nature and genesis of some granite-hosted gold deposits in the region, such as the Bigorne deposit (Fig. 1-C), are still not well understood. Previous work on deposit geology and mineralogy interpreted Bigorne as an intrusion-related gold system (Caessa et al., 1998; Inverno, 2002).\nThe present work describes the ore mineralogy, mineral chemistry, position of gold in the paragenetic sequence, and hydrothermal alteration at the Bigorne deposit, which help define the parameters that have controlled the ore-forming process. In particular, the mineralogical and thermodynamic stabilities of Au-Bi-Te-(S) phases present in the deposit are investigated to constrain the thermal evolution of the gold mineral assemblage. The source of fluid components in the Bigorne deposit are investigated using sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen isotopic compositions of minerals co-deposited with gold-bearing sulfides.\nThe study's main goals are better to constrain the regional-scale metallogenic evolution of the Iberian Massif, compare the Bigorne deposit with other granite-hosted gold deposits in northwestern Iberia, and evaluate the role of the host intrusions in the mineralization process. Results of the work contribute to the development of genetic and exploration models for Iberian gold deposits.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe main tectonism within the European Variscan Belt occurred during the amalgamation of Pangea in Carboniferous times when the closing of the Palaeozoic Rheic Ocean led to a complex and polycyclic collision between Gondwana and Laurussia (e.g., Nance et al., 2010; Kroner and Romer, 2013, Kroner et al., 2016, and references therein).\nThe Iberian Massif in central and northwestern Iberia (Fig. 1B represents one of the best exposures of the European Variscan Belt (Fig. 1-A). It has been subdivided into several paleogeographic zones, each reflecting a variable structural, stratigraphic and magmatic-metamorphic evolution. These include the Cantabrian zone (CZ), West Asturian-Leonese zone (WALZ), Galicia-Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes zone (GTMZ), Central Iberian zone (CIZ), Ossa-Morena zone (OMZ) and South Portuguese zone (SPZ) (Fig. 1-B; Julivert et al., 1972; Farias et al., 1987).\nThe tectonic-metamorphic evolution of the CIZ is explained as the result of two compressive deformation phases, during which the crust reached its maximum thickness (collisional stage of Variscan Orogeny), followed by a late, post-thickening, ductile event marking the end of the collision process in Iberia (intracontinental collision stages of Variscan Orogeny) (Ribeiro et al., 1974; Noronha et al., 1978; Dallmeyer et al., 1997; Dias et al., 2013; Mart\u00ednez-Catal\u00e1n et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2018).\nThe first deformation phase (D1) in the CIZ was active in the Middle to Late Devonian (ca. 365\u00a0Ma by 40Ar\/39Ar in muscovites: Dallmeyer et al., 1997; L\u00f3pez-Carmona et al., 2014) and is marked by regional-scale, subvertical, generally NW-SE trending folds. Initial contractional deformation was followed by D2 extensional deformation in the waning stages (Noronha et al., 1978; Escuder Viruete et al., 1994; D\u00edez Balda et al., 1995; Mart\u00ednez Catal\u00e1n et al., 2014; D\u00edez Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2016) responsible for the exhumation of high-grade rocks (ca. 337\u2013316\u00a0Ma; Escuder Viruete et al., 1994, 1998; Dallmeyer et al., 1997; Mart\u00ednez Catal\u00e1n et al., 2014; D\u00edez Fern\u00e1ndez and Pereira, 2016, and references therein).\nThe latest major regional-scale deformation event (D3) occurred at ca. 315\u00a0Ma and includes the development of upright folds that are commonly associated with subvertical, NW-SE to WNW-ESE, and ENE-WSW trending shear zones (Fig. 1-A-B) and syntectonic granite magmatism (e.g.,\nIglesias and Ribeiro, 1981; Ferreira et al., 1987; Dias et al., 1998; Neiva et al., 2009; Valle Aguado et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2018).\nA sequence of magmatic events has been recognized in the CIZ, some of which developed before the Variscan collision, whereas others were coeval with or immediately followed the latest (D3) tectonism phase (e.g., Sant'Ovaia et al., 2010; Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2018).\nThe late- to post-D3 intrusive rocks range between ca. 305\u2013290\u00a0Ma (Arthaud and Matte, 1975; Ribeiro et al., 1979; Marques et al., 2002; Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2015; Lima et al., 2018). This late-stage generated and\/or reactivated a few of the most important detected basement faults (with typical trends at NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW), including the NNE\u2013SSW Vilari\u00e7a-Manteigas-Bragan\u00e7a (VMBF) and Penacova-R\u00e9gua-Verin faults (PRVF) in Iberia northwestern (Iglesias and Ribeiro, 1981; Ribeiro et al., 1990; Marques et al., 2002). That can infer the relative age of both systems; they cut the D3 structures and Late-Variscan granites (300\u2013270\u00a0Ma; Marques et al., 2002). The Vila Pouca de Aguiar granite massif (U-Pb age: 299\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma) intrudes the PRVF zone and is interpreted to have been emplaced during the latest displacement on the fault (Martins et al., 2009).\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the Bigorne area\nThe Bigorne deposit is located in the CIZ in northern Portugal (Fig. 1-B, C). The deposit area is underlain by Variscan felsic intrusive rocks and Early Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks. The metamorphic sequence was variably affected by regional metamorphism and deformation during the Variscan orogeny (Fig. 1-C).\n\n2.2.1\nMetasedimentary rocks\nMetasedimentary rocks in the Bigorne area are variably and include, i) pre-Ordovician succession composed of a thick and monotonous sequence of pelites and greywackes, generally referred to as Schist Greywacke Complex (SGC) (Carrington da Costa, 1950); ii) an Ordovician clastic succession of stable marine platform sandstones; iii) Silurian black schist (Fig. 2\n-A). The emplacement of voluminous felsic magmas generated low-P\u2013high-T metamorphic contact aureoles in which sedimentary sequences such as pelites, sandstones, and greywackes were transformed into slate, quartzite, phyllite, spotted schist, and hornfels.\n\n\n2.2.2\nIntrusive rocks\nVariscan granitoids underlie about 90% of the Bigorne area (Fig. 2-A) and include several mappable intrusive phases, each with different mineralogical characteristics. They make up part of an extensive, composite massif termed the Lamego massif by Pereira et al., (2018), consisting mainly of biotite and biotite-muscovite granites (Ferreira et al., 1987; Carvalho et al., 2012). The various intrusive phases form NW-SE elongated bodies corresponding to the main orientation of the NW Iberian Variscan Belt. The Lamego massif that hosts the Bigorne deposit is bounded between two NW-SE-striking ductile shear zones: the Douro Beira shear zone (DBSZ) and the Vigo-Lamego shear zone (VLSZ) (Fig. 1-C). No geochronological data exist for the intrusions in the immediate Bigorne area, but ages for the local granitoids can be inferred by comparison with data obtained in similar intrusive phases in the same massif. The intrusive sequence in the Bigorne area (Fig. 2-A) is therefore interpreted as follows: (1) pre-to syn-D3 biotite granite (U-Pb: 319\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma) and (2) volumetrically dominant late-D3 and late- to post-D3 granodiorite-monzogranite and muscovite-biotite granite (U-Pb: age range of 309.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma to 303.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1\u00a0Ma) (Dias et al., 1998; Costa, 2011; Carvalho et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n2.3\nStructural geology\nThe overall ductile and brittle structures (dated at ca. 307\u00a0Ma; Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2015) of the region are mainly related to late Variscan (D3 and post-D3) deformation. Three major crustal-scale structures are present in the Bigorne area (Fig. 1-C): (1) the NW-SE striking DBSZ; 2) the NNW-SSE to NW-SE striking VLSZ; and (3) NNE-SSW striking Penacova-R\u00e9gua-Ver\u00edn strike-slip fault (PRVF). The DBSZ and VLSZ are somewhat older and are generally interpreted to have accommodated mainly dextral deformation (ages cluster around 308\u00a0Ma; Guti\u00e9rrez-Alonso et al., 2015). The PRVF is thought to have nucleated during D3 as a dextral strike-slip fault and subsequently reactivated as a sinistral structure with a transtensional component in late-Variscan times (Pereira et al., 1993; Marques et al., 2002). Although the PRVF traverses the Bigorne study area, there is only limited evidence for significant strike-slip displacement. Several more minor faults parallel to the PRVF are also present, and many of these show minor (<1\u20132\u00a0km) sinistral displacement of NW-SE trending bands of metasedimentary rocks (Fig. 2A. A significant alluvial deposit along the Balsem\u00e3o River west of Bigorne corresponds to an NNE-SSW-trending lineament that is tentatively interpreted to mark a fault zone and possibly a small down-dropped graben structure that formed late in the evolution of the PRVF (Fig. 2-A-B).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\nRepresentative rock samples from the Bigorne deposit were collected from surface outcrops during a detailed field mapping and sampling campaign (Fig. 2-B). Studies were carried out on representative samples from the different types of mineralized bodies, altered wall rocks, and intrusive host rocks to identify the mineralogy and investigate the ore paragenesis.\nObservations of mineral assemblages were done by transmitted and reflected light microscopy at the Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Porto. Complementary studies for characterization of mineral assemblages were performed at the Materials Centre of the University of Porto (CEMUP) (equipment: FEI Quanta 400 FEG-ESEM\/EDAX Genesis X4M) and Oviedo University, Spain (equipment: SEM-EDS (JEOL-6610LV)). Abbreviations of minerals were adopted from Kretz (1983) and Whitney and Evans (2010).\n\n3.1\nWhole-rock geochemistry\nSamples from intrusive host rocks (6 samples) were crushed in a jaw crusher and pulverized in an agate mill. Major and trace elements were determined by ICP-OES and ICP-MS, respectively. Detection limits for all elements are given in Table 2\n\n. The whole-rock FeO was determined by titration. These analyses were carried out by Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs), Ontario, Canada (\nhttps:\/\/actlabs.com\/geochemistry\/\n). The analytical package was 4LITHO (FeO) (11+).\n\n\n3.2\nMineral chemistry\nMineral analyses were performed at the Oviedo University (Spain) using an electron microprobe (EPMA), CAMECA SX-100 model. Major elements were determined at 15\u00a0kV accelerating voltage, with a 15nA beam current (2\u00a0\u03bcm focused beam) an acquisition time between 10 and 20\u00a0s for X-ray peak and background.\nTo attain lower detection limits for testing the possible presence of invisible gold in sulfides, approximately 100 analyses of trace elements (Au, Ag, Sb, Pb, Bi, Te, Se, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Hg) were performed on arsenopyrite and pyrite and also in other ore minerals. The operating conditions were a 20\u00a0keV accelerating voltage, with a 100nA beam current (5\u00a0\u03bcm focused beam), and 120\u2013180\u00a0s count time. The minimum detection limits were 594\u00a0ppm for Au and 228\u00a0ppm for Ag, 161\u00a0ppm for Sb, 549\u00a0ppm for Pb, 455 for Bi ppm, 186\u00a0ppm for Te, 161\u00a0ppm for Cu, 130\u00a0ppm for Zn, 350\u00a0ppm for Se, 180\u00a0ppm for Co, 275\u00a0ppm for S, 108\u00a0ppm for Fe and 270\u00a0ppm for As.\nThe acquired X-ray intensities were corrected for atomic number, mass absorption, and secondary fluorescence effects using the CAMECA x-phi program. Natural and synthetic sulfides, oxides, and native elements were used as reference materials.\n\n\n3.3\nIsotopic analysis\nIsotopic analyses were made on quartz and arsenopyrite that are considered to be associated with the precipitation of gold in the Bigorne deposit. Oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotopic compositions were measured on bulk samples because it was impossible to separate the different generations of quartz and arsenopyrite. Six bulk samples from the different mineralized veins were subjected to hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis and five bulk samples to sulfur isotope analysis. All samples of mineral separates were hand-picked and checked under a binocular microscope to ensure the purity of >98%.\nConventional isotope analyses were carried out in the Stable Isotopes Laboratory of Salamanca University, Spain.\n\n3.3.1\nOxygen\nAll separates were analyzed using a laser fluorination procedure involving total sample reaction with excess ClF3 using a CO2 laser as a heat source. All combustion resulted in a 100% release of O2 from the silica lattice. This O2 was then converted to CO2 by reaction with hot graphite, then analyzed by a VG SIRA II spectrometer. Results are reported in standard notation (\u03b418O) as per mil (\u2030) deviations from the Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) standard in Table 6. Reproducibility is better than \u00b10.2\u2030 (1\u03c3).\n\n\n3.3.2\nHydrogen\nPure quartz samples were heated to 150\u00a0\u00b0C under a high vacuum to release unstable volatiles. The released water was then reduced to H2 and passed slowly through a tube containing a quantity of metallic uranium inside a furnace at 800\u00a0\u00b0C, with the evolved gas measured quantitatively in a Hg manometer, before collecting using a Toeppler pump.\nReplicate analyses of water standards (international standards V-SMOW and GISP, and internal standard Lt Std) gave a reproducibility of \u00b12\u2030. Analytical results are summarized as \u03b4D notation as per mil (\u2030) variations from the international V-SMOW standard in Table 6.\n\n\n3.3.3\nSulfur\nSulfide separates were analyzed by conventional techniques (Robinson and Kusakabe, 1975) in which SO2 gas was liberated by combusting the sulfides under vacuum with excess Cu2O at 1075\u00a0\u00b0C. Liberated gases were analyzed on a VG Isotech SIRA II mass spectrometer. Reproducibility was better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030 (1\u03c3). Data are reported in \u03b434S notation as permil (\u2030) variations from the Vienna Ca\u00f1on Diablo Troilite (V-CDT) standard. The analytical results are summarized in Table 6.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nHost rocks\n\n4.1.1\nMain features\nGold mineralization in the Bigorne deposit is hosted by late and late to post-D3 granitoids, which occur as three mappable phases within the Lamego massif (Fig. 1-C). Macroscopically, three main intrusive phases can be distinguished: (1) biotite-rich, coarse-grained porphyritic granite corresponding to the regional late-D3 granites; (2) biotite\u00a0>\u00a0muscovite, medium-grained porphyritic granite; and (3) biotite\u00a0=\u00a0muscovite medium-to fine-grained granite with sparse phenocrysts corresponding to the regional late to post-D3 granites (Fig. 3\n. Local textural variations are common in the granites and it is typical to find small enclaves of granodiorite in the late to post-D3 granites. The contacts between granites phases are usually sharp, and no transitional zones are observed. The main petrographic features reveal a wide range of textures but generally have similar mineralogical composition (Fig. 3. The different petrographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1: Appendix.\n\n\n4.1.2\nWhole-rock geochemistry\nMajor and trace element data of representative samples of Bigorne intrusive rocks are given in Table 2: Appendix. Measured SiO2 contents range from 67.62 to 70.75\u00a0wt%. K2O contents (3.88\u20135.34\u00a0wt%) are always higher than Na2O, corresponding to alkali-calcic and calc-alkalic associations in the discriminant diagram of Frost et al., (2001) (Fig. 4\n-A). These granitoids show a peraluminous character, with an A\/CNK index (Shand, 1943) ranging from medium (1.09) to high (1.28) values. Compositional variances in major elements between different samples are minor, as shown graphically in the B-A diagram (Fig. 4-B) of Debon and Le Fort (1983; modified by Villaseca et al., 1998). On the total alkali-SiO2 diagram of Middlemost (1994), the studied samples plot in the granodiorite and granite field sensu stricto (Fig. 4-C). The B parameter values (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Mg\u00a0+\u00a0Ti in millications) are more dispersed in late to post-D3 granites than in late-D3 granites, higher in samples 5, 6, and 7, which have a granodioritic composition. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns (normalization values from Boynton, 1984; Fig. 4-D) are analogous for all samples, but with differences in the total abundance: 234\u2013277\u00a0ppm in the late-D3 and 167\u2013386\u00a0ppm in the late-to post-D3 granites with the higher values in granodiorite samples. All samples show similar REE spectra with enrichment in LREE relatively to HREE (La\/LuN\u00a0=\u00a024.93\u201349.34) and a similar negative Eu anomaly (Eu\/Eu*=0.37\u20130.58).\nMulti-elemental diagram normalized to the average bulk continental crust composition of Taylor and McLennan (1995) shows similar patterns for the two granitic phases (Fig. 4-E), with positive anomalies in Cs, Rb, Th, U, La, and Nd (LREE), and negative ones in Nb, Ta, Sr, Ti, Tm and Yb (HREE).\n\n\n\n4.2\nDeposit-scale structure\n\n4.2.1\nMineralized structures\nThe main gold mineralization at Bigorne commonly occurs as sheeted quartz-sulfide vein arrays filling parallel, sub-vertical to steeply dipping, NNE-SSW-trending extensional fractures (Fig. 5\n-A). The orientations of the main mineralized structures observed in the outcrops are N10\u00b0-20\u00b0E\/70\u00b0W and N20\u00b0-40\u00b0E\/60\u00b0-80\u00b0W and crosscut all of the intrusive phases in the Bigorne area. Sub-horizontal slickensides have been observed along the quartz-sulfide veins' margins in rare locations, indicating a minor strike-slip shear component of deformation has locally affected the deposit. Another barren, milky quartz system with an E-W trend is observed; the NNE system locally cuts this. These later veins typically do not show marginal hydrothermal alteration zones. The mineralized fractures are of variable length (centimeter to metric dimension) (Fig. 5-A) and variable thickness (1 up to 15\u00a0cm). Interconnected, multidirectional vein stockworks are not observed anywhere in the Bigorne deposit. Vein contacts are typically sharp and planar and display little or no shear-related markers or lineations. Mineralized domains of the granites show differential weathering with the veins standing out in \u201cpositive relief\u201d (Fig. 5-A-D) likely reflecting minor silicification in narrow envelopes surrounding the fractures and veins.\nIndividual veins may contain up to several g\/tonne of gold (Caessa et al., 1998), with rare samples yielding up to 40\u00a0g\/tonne (Mortensen and Mackenzie, unpublished data).\nThe mineralized zones at Bigorne consist of quartz-sulfide veins (Fig. 5-B-C), simple fractures with oxidized material (Fig. 5-D-E), and disseminated sulfides in the hydrothermal alteration halo of the mineralized veins (Fig. 5-F).\nThe mineralogy of the oxidized material consists of Fe-hydroxides and dispersed sulfide aggregates (vuggy gossanous veining) (Fig. 5-D-E). The quartz-sulfide veins reveal slight internal textural variation and are associated with major sulfides (arsenopyrite and pyrite) and minor wolframite, scheelite, and tourmaline. The sulfides appear attached to the vein walls or filling fractures in quartz (Fig. 5-C). In the contact of quartz-sulfide veins with the granite is present a hydrothermal alteration halo with low extension (1 to 20\u00a0cm width) rich on white mica with some disseminated euhedral arsenopyrite crystals (Fig. 5-F). These alteration zones are diffuse, irregular, and restricted to the immediate vicinity of veins.\n\n\n4.2.2\nParagenetic sequence\nPetrographic observations from mineralized zones at Bigorne suggest at least three main mineralization stages (Fig. 6\n, including (i) Stage 1 - an oxide stage with quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0wolframite-scheelite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite-pyrite, (ii) Stage 2 - a sulfide stage quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite-pyrite-galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0gold assemblage, and iii) Stage 3 - a supergene stage with scorodite and covellite. The main hydrothermal alteration present comprises a mica selvage enveloping the mineralized quartz veins.\nGeochemical analyses of white micas from the hydrothermal alteration halos are given in Table 3\n, and geochemical analyses of sulfides and bismuth tellurides from Bigorne gold-bearing quartz veins are given in Tables 4 and 5\n\n\n.\n\n\n4.2.3\nStage 1\nIn the early stages, quartz crystals occur as milky quartz grains (Qz-1) infilling parallel to the vein walls. Small amounts of wolframite and scheelite are locally observed in the margins of a few mineralized veins associated with Stage 1 quartz (Qz-1) (Fig. 7\n-A-B). Qz-1 shows wavy extinction and deformation bands, indicating that it underwent ductile\u2013brittle deformation after formation (Fig. 7-B). Some sparsely distributed arsenopyrite (Apy-1) is also present. Apy-1 is As-rich (32.47 at.% of As; Fig. 8\n-A) and euhedral to subhedral. Application of the arsenopyrite geothermometer indicates a maximum temperature of 455\u00a0\u00b0C for arsenopyrite deposition in this stage (Fig. 8-C: Kretschmar and Scott, 1976; Sharp et al., 1985).\nIn this early stage of mineralization, the granite is altered along with the vein walls. Tourmaline occurs in clusters generally normal to the wall-rock contacts, associated to the hydrothermal alterations zones. The tourmaline is earlier than arsenopyrite-2 (Fig. 7-C). All the analyzed white micas from the hydrothermal alteration halo (Fig. 7-D) have high contents in TiO2, FeO, and MgO (Table 3, representing solid solution between muscovite and celadonite, and belong to phengite series (Rieder et al., 1998; Tischendorf et al., 2004).\n\n\n4.2.4\nStage 2\nThe later quartz (Qz-2) is clearer than quartz (Qz-1) and cements fractured arsenopyrite along with white micas (\u00b1chlorite) (Fig. 7 - B). Qz-2 shows a less marked wavy extinction than Qz-1. The white micas are fine-grained, subhedral, and radial with a chemical composition near to the celadonite component. Apy-2 is As-poor (30.60 at.% of As; Fig. 8-A) forms massive aggregates (up to 20\u00a0mm in length) that fill quartz-sulfide veinlets and show well-developed faces at the border of massive aggregates. Single crystals of Apy-2 are generally smaller than those in Apy-1. Petrographic observation and microprobe data suggest continuous arsenopyrite deposition from early to late mineralization stages (Fig. 8-A). EPMA data reveal a pure FeAsS phase. The As content corresponds to minimum formation temperatures of 354\u00b0C for this stage (Fig. 8-C; Kretschmar and Scott 1976; Sharp et al., 1985). In most of the analyzed arsenopyrite crystals, the variation in the Fe content is insignificant (33.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 at.%). Generally, trace elements contents in arsenopyrite are below detection of the EMPA.\nPyrite occurs as aggregated intergrowths with arsenopyrite (Fig. 7-E). The EPMA data on pyrite show an uniform composition (Table 4, which is As-poor (As\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0wt%). Chalcopyrite is present in fractures that cut the arsenopyrite crystals, and trace amounts of galena and sphalerite occur as blebs and slight irregular inclusions (<50\u00a0\u03bcm) in arsenopyrite and pyrite.\nSulfides from the mineralized bodies and the host rock have been affected by brittle deformation and are moderate to pervasively oxidized (Fig. 7-E-F).\n\n\n4.2.5\nStage 3\nThe latest paragenetic stage mainly comprises very clear light grey quartz (Qz-3), which fills cavities. Covellite is rare and partially surrounds arsenopyrite and bismuthinite. Scorodite usually proceeds inward from crystal boundaries or along with fractures. All minerals are anhedral and brecciated.\n\n\n4.2.6\nGold mineral assemblages\nThree generations of native gold were distinguished at Bigorne based on textural features. Au-1 forms composite aggregates with Bi\u2013Te \u00b1 (S) phases<10\u00a0\u03bcm in size and occurs only as irregular inclusions in arsenopyrite (Fig. 9\n-A). Au-2 comprises small veinlets and individual (30\u00a0\u03bcm-100\u00a0\u03bcm) homogenous particles, and it is the most abundant type of gold in the deposit (Fig. 9-B). Au-2 also occurs in arsenopyrite, pyrite, and scorodite, infilling intergranular spaces between crystals and microfractures. Au-3 comprises low-fineness gold particles associated with chalcopyrite (less common type) (Fig. 9-C). Gold compounds such as maldonite (Au2Bi) (Fig. 9-D) and to a lesser degree calaverite (AuTe2) (Fig. 9-E) are observed in a few samples from the Bigorne veins. Maldonite occurs as small droplets or cavity infillings only within arsenopyrite crystals (2\u00a0\u00b5m up to 20\u00a0\u00b5m). Calaverite appears to fill fractures in arsenopyrite and is associated with bismuthinite (Bi2S3). These minerals occurred as single grains or as gold intergrowths with Bi\u2013Te\u00b1(S) phases and native bismuth, forming composite aggregates with curvilinear boundaries or triple junctions between the phases and textures like droplet-shape inclusions (Fig. 9-F-G-H). There is textural evidence that clusters of Au-Bi-Te droplets predate the fracturing of the host arsenopyrite. Native bismuth occurs together with native gold, maldonite, and other Bi-Te minerals and as monomineralic veinlets in arsenopyrite. In some cases, thin rims of bismuthinite (Bi2S3) overgrow native bismuth in contact with gangue minerals. EMPA analyses show that gold occurs as a moderate- to high-fineness native gold (typically\u00a0<\u00a022\u00a0wt.% Ag) composition (Leal et al., 2021). Native bismuth is chemically pure. The crystals are commonly tiny, which makes the EMPA analysis difficult. Only a few bismuth-telluride phases have been confidently identified by EPMA analysis (hedleyite (Bi7Te3); Table 5. The rest of all are identified by SEM-EDS analysis. Trace admixtures in hedleyite may consist in Sb (up to 0.4\u00a0wt.%), Se (up to 0.04\u00a0wt.%) and Au (0.61\u00a0wt.%; one analysis only). Measured Fe, S, and As contents are from the arsenopyrite host. The rest of the analyses have contamination by native gold, and maldonite cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n\n4.3\nHydrogen, oxygen and sulfur isotopes\nMeasured \u03b418O in quartz from mineralized veins at Bigorne shows a restricted range of values around (+12\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a012.3\u2030) (Table 6. Assuming there was equilibrium between fluids and minerals, the isotopic compositions for \u03b4D and \u03b418O of fluids were calculated based on estimated temperatures from arsenopyrite geothermometer (i.e., Apy-1, 455\u00b0C; Apy-2, 354\u00b0C) (Table 6. The oxygen isotopic compositions of ore-forming fluids (\u03b418Ofluid) have been calculated the oxygen isotopic fractionation equation of the quartz\u2013water system defined by Matsuhisa et al., (1979). The calculated \u03b418O fluid values from quartz range between\u00a0+\u00a09.3 and\u00a0+\u00a06.8\u2030. All the \u03b4DSMOW values of quartz can be used to represent \u03b4Dfluid values. The \u03b4D compositions of fluids from quartz are between \u201362.5 and \u201364.7\u2030. Sulfur isotope determinations were carried out on representative arsenopyrites from the mineralized veins in the Bigorne deposit. The \u03b434S values clustered around \u22122.8\u2030 (Table 6.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTiming of mineralization\nMost gold mineralization at Bigorne occurs on the west side of the inferred main strand of the PRVF; however, prospecting and sampling have demonstrated that similar mineralization is also present between strands and to the immediate east of the fault zone (Mortensen and MacKenzie, unpublished data). Although the mineralization is probably closely related to displacement on the PRVF, the relatively small amount of sinistral displacement that appears to have occurred on the fault makes it impossible to establish the exact temporal relationship between mineralization and fault offset. U-Pb dating by Martins et al., (2009), indicates that displacement on the PRVF occurred at 299\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma or slightly earlier, and we suggest that the Bigorne deposit likely formed at approximately this same time.\n\n\n5.2\nHost rocks\nTaking into account, the different granites that occur in the study area, its petrological and geochemical characteristics are similar to the other Variscan biotite-rich late- and late-to post-tectonic ilmenite type granites with mafic microgranular enclaves considered as the result of magmas that mainly originated in the lower crust but recorded some mantel influence (Dias et al., 1998; Sant'Ovaia et al., 2010; Costa, 2011; Carvalho et al., 2012).\nInferred crystallization ages of the various intrusive host rocks for Bigorne gold mineralization are considerably older than our suggested age for the mineralization itself. Mineralization occurs within all three of the main intrusive phases identified in the area. The composition of the mineralization and the nature and extent of associated hydrothermal alteration are similar; thus, the intrusive rocks appear to have acted as passive hosts for the mineralization.\n\n\n5.3\nDeposit-scale structure\nMineralized structures are mainly extensional veins (locally showing evidence for strike-slip reactivation and shearing) and occur in sheeted veins arrays that are typically not interlinked. Vein density appears to be the main grade-controlling feature. Auriferous vein development was dominantly controlled by the NNE-SSW striking structures parallel to the regional Penacova-R\u00e9gua-Ver\u00edn strike-slip fault. These observations conclude that the mineralized areas formed in a structural setting related to the main Late Variscan regional strain, coeval with lithosphere-scale strike-slip deformation, as consequences of crustal decompression during uplift that is commonly associated with a shift in the far-field stress regime due to a transition from compressional to transpressional settings.\nVisible hydrothermal alteration is restricted to the vein walls and is structurally controlled. A lateral zonation for the hydrothermal assemblage occurred after the opening of the joint system, which provided channels for fluid circulation.\nThe mineral assemblage, particularly the arsenopyrite crystals, locally shows a cataclastic texture associated with regional deformation after the main sulfide deposition and corresponding to the reactivation of NNE-SSW faults. The vein style, orientation, mineralogy, and structural timing are shared with that of many other gold deposits in the region, such as Limarinho, Ponte de Barca, and Penedono (Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016; Neiva et al., 2019).\nGold mineralization at Bigorne is interpreted to be the result of two modes of gold deposition: 1) gold scavenged by bismuth melts due to local dissolution of arsenopyrite by hydrothermal fluids, which would have produced reduced conditions for the formation of bismuth melt (Pokrovski et al., 2002, Pokrovski et al., 2014); and 2) a local-scale reworking of maldonite resulting from a decrease of \u0192S2 of ore-forming fluid, triggered by fluid-rock reactions and crystallization of sulfides, implying gold remobilization, which represents the primary episode of gold deposition (coarse native Au-1).\nThe hydrothermal system at Bigorne evolved from an initial high temperature (>455\u00b0C; maximum estimated temperature deposition for Apy-1) for the oxide stage and Apy-2 with a minimum temperature of 354\u00b0C. The highest melting-T phase (371\u00b0C) corresponds to maldonite (Au2Bi) crystallization (Okamoto and Masaalski, 1983), followed by hedleyite (Bi7Te3) at 312\u00b0C (Okamoto and Tanner, 1990). As the temperature decreased, the tellurium content in Bi-Te compounds also decreased until it reached the melting temperature of bismuth (Bi-metal at 271\u00b0C). The upper temperature limits for the Au-Bi-Te assemblage are set by melting points: the (Bi7Te3\u00a0+\u00a0Bi) at 266\u00b0C, the (Au2Bi\u00a0+\u00a0Bi) at 241\u00b0C and the (Bi7Te3\u00a0+\u00a0Bi\u00a0+\u00a0Au2Bi) at 235\u00b0C. The lower end of temperature the Au-Bi-Te assemblage and the inferred temperature deposition coarse native gold deposition (nearly < 241\u00b0C) latter than the latter arsenopyrite (Apy-2 with a minimum temperature of 354\u00b0C). This is in agreement with previous research on fluid inclusion data on other similar gold deposits in the Iberian Massif where the bulk fluid inclusion in quartz of the mineralized veins and gas chemistry consisted of modified fluids (P\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0MPa and T\u00a0<\u00a0300\u00b0C) with the main gold deposition being relatively late (e.g., Cathelineau et al., 1993; Boiron et al., 1996; Noronha et al., 2000; Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016; Neiva et al., 2019).\n\n\n5.4\nSource of fluids\nThe calculated fluid oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of quartz in the Bigorne deposit overlap the metamorphic and magmatic fluids fields, suggesting that the hydrothermal fluid at Bigorne could have originated from a deep-seated metamorphic and\/or magmatic source. The range of \u03b4D and \u03b418O compositions of fluids is similar to that of many other orogenic gold deposits, ranging from\u00a0+\u00a06 to\u00a0+\u00a011\u2030 in Precambrian ores and from\u00a0+\u00a07 to\u00a0+\u00a013\u2030 in Phanerozoic ores (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). The \u03b418OSMOW values from some gold deposits in NW of Iberian Massif range from\u00a0+\u00a012 to\u00a0+\u00a013.7\u2030 (Fuertes-Fuente et al., 2016).\nThe \u03b418Ofluid values from Bigorne quartz-sulfide veins range from\u00a0+\u00a09.3 to\u00a0+\u00a06.8\u2030. These values could reflect metamorphic fluids, which were mixing with meteoric fluids during late mineralization stages. Boiron et al., (2003) reported \u03b418Ofluid values from 12.5 to 0.3\u2030 in various Variscan gold deposits, which were interpreted to reflect fluids whose salinities decreased to shallow values during progressive dilution waters of more surficial origin in the fault system zones.\nFew stable isotope studies have been undertaken on granitic rocks near the Bigorne area. Costa et al., (2014) reported whole-rock oxygen isotopic compositions in leucogranites of \u03b418O-wr\u00a0=\u00a011.33\u2030 whereas lower \u03b418O-wr\u00a0=\u00a010.6\u2030 characterizes related granodiorites. The \u03b418Ofluid values from the Bigorne gold-bearing veins may suggest a metamorphic fluid or a mixed fluid source with the country rocks and meteoric fluids.\n\u03b434S values of arsenopyrite in the mineralized veins (-2.8\u2030) point toward the possibility of a magmatic influence for the sulfur signature source (Seal, 2006; Hoefs, 2018). Due to the lack of minerals indicative of oxidizing hydrothermal conditions (e.g., hematite and sulfates), a reduced state was attributed to the sulfur transport, most likely as H2S, and the negative \u03b434S values cannot be assigned to fractionation processes (Hoefs, 2018).\nGranitoid rocks have an average \u03b434S value of 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u2030 (Seal, 2006), but range from\u00a0\u2212\u00a011 to 14.5\u2030, which presumably reflects variable assimilation or partial melting of either pyritic sedimentary rocks with low \u03b434S values or evaporites with high \u03b434S values (Sasaki and Ishihara 1979; Ishihara and Sasaki 1989; Santosh and Masuda 1991). Ishihara and Sasaki (1989) studies in ilmenite-series granitoids show \u03b434S values < 0\u2030, generally regarded as having formed through partial melting of dominantly sedimentary protoliths, whereas magnetite-series granitoids thought to originate from dominantly igneous protoliths had \u03b434S values > 0\u2030. The geological context can also affect the isotope composition signature (Ohmoto and Goldhaber 1997). The \u03b434S values can be different in some gold deposits in the CIZ, but the origin of the fluids (\u03b418Ofluid) is well constrained (e.g., Limarinho deposit: \u03b434S values from \u22129.2 to \u22127.1\u2030; Penedono deposit: \u03b434S values from \u22125.3 and \u22124.3\u2030). The negative values of \u03b434S in the mineralized veins (-2.8\u2030) and \u03b418O values around (12\u2030 to 12.3\u2030) could be not related to a magmatic source. Iyer (1992) interpreted lighter values of S isotope as reflecting oxidation of reduced sulfur or influence of meteoric water, also resulting in increasing oxygen fugacity.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe Bigorne deposit is a \u201cgranite-hosted gold deposit\u201d and presents some features that are more akin to the OGDs (than IRGD) elsewhere in other Phanerozoic orogenic belts.\nBased on the vein textures, sulfur isotope values, composition of ore fluids, conditions, and inferred age of ore formation, we suggest that the granitic rocks in the Bigorne area acted only as a competent structural host for ore deposition from fault-related, metal-rich fluids that migrated up from depth. Fault zones in late Variscan deformation stages provide suitable pathways for hydrothermal fluids' leaching, transportation, and precipitation processes (Pohl & Belocky, 1994, 1999).\nThe isotopic composition of the fluids found at Bigorne is consistent with those of OGDs elsewhere in the Variscan Belt, in which hydrothermal fluids are interpreted not to be related to magmatic sources. The stable isotope data, interpreted in the context of the regional and local geology and the estimated timing of mineralization, suggest that the sulfur- and gold-bearing fluids that generated OGDs in northwestern Iberia were related to the progressive dilution and cooling of the crustal fluids by oxidizing solutions penetrating the basement from the surface, during Late Carboniferous extensional tectonism (Boiron et al., 1996, 2003; Noronha et al., 2000).\nThe intimate association of gold with bismuth-tellurium-bearing phases at the Bigorne deposit is assumed to be a consequence of Au scavenging by liquid bismuth-bearing phases; i.e., an example of the 'bismuth collector' model (Douglas et al., 2000; Tooth et al., 2008, Tooth et al., 2011). This gold-bearing hydrothermal event may have enhanced the gold grade in this type of gold deposit, which is well represented in the Iberian Variscan belt.\nThis model is also thought to apply to most other granitoid-associated Au deposits in the region, considering the similarity in their structural control, paragenetic evolutions, and chemistry of the ore fluids.\nHowever, considering the other characteristics of the Bigorne deposit, the \u03b434S can be attributed to metamorphic fluids leached metals from the country rocks or from fluid(s) that were in equilibrium with the granite.\nTherefore, gold deposits in the western part of the CIZ were formed by the superposition of several processes and show similar timing of hydrothermal events, suggesting that large-scale late Variscan tectonic processes controlled the hydrothermal history, as consequences of crustal decompression during uplift that is commonly associated with a shift in the far-field stress regime due to a transition from compressional to transpressional settings.\n\n","53":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nStructurally controlled gold deposits are located for hundreds of kilometers along the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Klamath Mountains gold provinces of California, United States. More than 115 Moz of lode and placer gold have been produced from mining in California, with the Klamath Mountains being the second most productive lode and placer gold province in California, behind the Sierra Nevada foothills (Craig and Rimstidt, 1998). In the Klamath Mountains, more than 7 Moz of gold is estimated to have been produced (Hotz, 1971a). Most of the Klamath Mountains\u2019 production was from placer mining, but 27 % has been extracted from the gold-bearing quartz veins (Silberman and Danielson, 1993).\nNumerous studies have characterized the diachronous timing of gold mineralization within the Sierra Nevada foothills and how this timing relates to regional stress controls (Marsh et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2015). Prior to this present study, however, only a single gold deposit within the Klamath Mountains had been dated (~148\u2013146\u00a0Ma; Elder and Cashman, 1992) so that the absolute age range of gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains has remained unresolved. This lack of available data has precluded identification of similar relationships between timing of mineralization and regional stress controls in the Klamath Mountains.\nThis study reports new 40Ar\/39Ar geochronological data for hydrothermal muscovite from eight orogenic gold deposits located throughout the Klamath Mountains gold province of California. This is the first comprehensive regional study constraining the timing of gold deposit formation in the Klamath Mountains. The data allow a direct comparison with the timing of ore formation in the Sierra Nevada foothills gold province and an improved interpretation of the tectonic and metallogenic evolution of California during the Late Jurassic through Early Cretaceous. Here, we show that initiation of orogenic gold deposit formation in both the Klamath Mountains and Sierra Nevada foothills provinces was synchronous and that mineralization spanned different stress regimes and thus tectonic events. Termination of gold formation in the Klamath Mountains relates to lateral displacement away from the active arc and local heat center.\n\n\n2\nBackground\n\n2.1\nTectonic setting\nPresent-day California has undergone a complex geological evolution since the late Paleozoic. Permian to Triassic accretion of Devonian-Permian near-shore island arcs onto the continental margin of North America included the docking of the Northern Sierra terrane now exposed in the Sierra Nevada and the correlative Central Metamorphic and Eastern Klamath terranes in the Klamath Mountains (Fig. 1\n; Dickinson, 2000, 2004, 2008). The Devonian to Late Jurassic allochthonous and autochthonous terranes that comprise the more outboard parts of the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Klamath Mountains were incrementally amalgamated beginning in the Middle Triassic (Dickinson, 2008). The amalgamated tectonic belts and the faults that separate them have gentle eastward dips within the Klamath Mountains, whereas those in the Sierra Nevada are steeply dipping to the east (summarized in Ernst et al., 2016). Many of the low-angle terrane-bounding faults in the Klamath Mountains are cut by younger, high-angle faults. Growth of the continental margin occurred largely through transform and transpressive terrane amalgamation (Saleeby et al., 1992; Ernst et al., 2008; Ernst, 2013).\nMetamorphism, deformation, and magmatism within the terranes resulted from thrusting, terrane amalgamation, and arc activity during alternating periods of compression and extension (Harper and Wright, 1984), that likely involved margin-parallel translation (Hacker et al., 1995). In the Klamath Mountains, two distinct compressional orogenic episodes, one in the Middle Jurassic and one in the Late Jurassic, were separated by a period of extension. The Middle Jurassic compressional episode, the Siskiyou orogeny, is documented by metamorphism, folding, and regional thrusting (Coleman et al., 1988; Wright and Fahan, 1988). Absolute age estimates for this contractional episode have it beginning at approximately 169\u00a0Ma and ending at either 167\u00a0Ma (Hacker et al., 1995), 165\u00a0Ma (Godfrey and Dilek, 2000), or 161\u00a0Ma (Coleman et al., 1988; Wright and Fahan, 1988). However, Snoke and Barnes (2006) noted the difficulty in defining the thermal signature of the Siskiyou orogeny, which makes providing the absolute timing of the event difficult to determine. This compressive event was likely terminated prior to 164\u00a0Ma because the Klamath Mountains terranes underwent extension as exemplified by ophiolite formation and dike swarm emplacement between\u00a0~ 164 and 157\u2013155\u00a0Ma (Wright and Wyld, 1986; Wyld and Wright, 1988; Hacker et al., 1995; Godfrey and Dilek, 2000). The Late Jurassic compressional Nevadan orogeny followed, with further folding, thrusting, and metamorphism from approximately 157\u2013150\u00a0Ma (Wright and Fahan, 1988). Orthogonal plate convergence related to the Nevadan orogeny affected both the Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada foothills (Gray, 2006). Minor magmatism, metamorphism, and deformation in the Klamath Mountains continued until\u00a0~\u00a0135\u00a0Ma (Harper and Wright, 1984; Harper et al., 1994).\nDistinct Middle Jurassic through Cretaceous plutonic episodes are independently distinguished within the Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada foothills. Temporal and compositional characteristics of plutons in the Klamath Mountains have been used to differentiate discrete episodes of magmatic activity (Lanphere et al., 1968; Hotz, 1971b; Allen and Barnes, 2006; Snoke and Barnes, 2006). Irwin (1985) described 11 Ordovician through Early Cretaceous plutonic belts while Allen and Barnes (2006) separated out three plutonic intervals between 174 and 136\u00a0Ma. Most notably, plutons of pre-Nevadan versus post-Nevadan orogeny age have distinctive geochemistry and isotopic compositions (Barnes et al., 1992). Pre-Nevadan orogeny plutons show isotopic characteristics consistent with incorporation of metasedimentary rocks reflecting a component of crustal melting and assimilation at deep crustal levels, whereas post-Nevadan plutons have trace element geochemistry that is indicative of partial melting of young oceanic rocks that would have been thrust under hanging wall host terranes during the Nevadan orogeny (Barnes et al., 1992). The arc magmatism that lasted from 174 to 136\u00a0Ma began with initial arc construction during the Siskiyou orogeny (Wright and Fahan, 1988).\nTwo distinct Middle Jurassic through Early Cretaceous episodes of syn- to post-accretionary plutonism are recognized in the Sierra Nevada and are temporally separated (Glazner, 1991; Irwin and Wooden, 2001), although an additional older event that affected the southwestern USA from 205 to 175\u00a0Ma resulted in minor intrusive activity within the Sierra Nevada-Klamath Mountains arc (Barton et al., 2011). One episode occurred mainly from 170 to 140\u00a0Ma when the Sierra Nevada foothills formed a semi-continuous volcano-plutonic arc with the Klamath Mountains (Ernst, 2013). A 15 million-years-long magmatic lull existed before the next magmatic episode from 125 to 85\u00a0Ma that led to the formation of the Sierra Nevada subduction-related batholith. Plutonism of this younger episode is absent in the Klamath Mountains (Ernst, 2013; Ernst et al., 2016).\nStrike-slip processes along both the northern and southern margins of the Klamath Mountains terranes translated them approximately 200\u00a0km to the west of their Jurassic arc position to their current outboard location, likely along the Oak Creek-Sulphur Creek fault zone (Ernst et al., 2008; Ernst, 2013). The correspondence of 170\u2013140\u00a0Ma plutonism between the two mountain ranges combined with the absence of the 125\u201385\u00a0Ma plutonic events in the Klamath Mountains helps to constrain the translation to the time of the 15 million-years-long magmatic lull. Ernst (2013) suggested that the pattern of sedimentation along the southeastern edge of the Klamath Mountains further constrains the bulk of the translation to 140\u2013136\u00a0Ma, which coincides with the age of the youngest dated plutons in the Klamath Mountains (Irwin and Wooden, 2001).\nSeveral observations, however, suggest that the timing of this lateral translation may be slightly younger than proposed by Ernst (2013). The three youngest plutons (137\u2013136\u00a0Ma), and five of the six youngest plutons in the Klamath Mountains (139\u2013136\u00a0Ma) are located in the farthest landward Eastern Klamath terrane (Fig. 1; see Irwin, 2003). These are compositionally similar to\u00a0~\u00a0140\u00a0Ma plutons found in more seaward terranes of the northwestern Sierra Nevada (Davis, 1963). The lateral offset of the host terranes for this episode of magmatism further suggests that the Klamath Mountains-Sierra Nevada offset was initiated prior to the youngest magmatic activity in the Klamath Mountains as the block began to move away from the active arc. Furthermore, Jones and Irwin (1971) documented Valanginian (139.8\u2013132.9\u00a0Ma) shoreline deposits that offer a one-dimensional offset marker suggesting that the Klamath Mountains-Sierra Nevada offset occurred subsequent to the shoreline deposition. The estimated offset of the Valanginian shoreline deposits (Jones and Irwin, 1971) is less than that estimated for the Klamath Mountains-Sierra Nevada (Ernst, 2013), implying that the provincial offset may have begun prior to but finished after Valanginian shoreline deposition. In slight contrast to Ernst (2013), these observations indicate that the lateral offset between the provinces was initiated sometime between 140 and 136\u00a0Ma and continued beyond 136\u00a0Ma.\nGold mineralization within the Sierra Nevada foothills province has been noted to incrementally span a 45-million-years-long range, overlapping the first plutonic episode at 160\u00a0Ma, through the separation of the Klamath Mountains during the magmatic lull at\u00a0~\u00a0140\u2013136\u00a0Ma, and finally overlapping some of the second magmatic episode until\u00a0~\u00a0115\u00a0Ma (Marsh et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2015). The Grass Valley district, the largest gold district in California, was characterized by two distinct gold-forming episodes prior to the westward translation of the Klamath Mountains. The district contains the oldest known orogenic gold deposits in the Sierra Nevada foothills province, one N-S-trending vein set having formed at\u00a0~\u00a0160\u00a0Ma (U-Pb xenotime; Taylor et al., 2015) and an E-W-trending vein set having formed at\u00a0~\u00a0152\u00a0Ma (40Ar\/39Ar mariposite; Snow et al., 2008). These are the only dated gold deposits in the Sierra Nevada foothills that are currently known to have formed prior to the 140\u2013136\u00a0Ma initiation of lateral offset of the Klamath Mountains (Ernst, 2013).\n\n\n2.2\nKlamath Mountains geology\nTectonostratigraphic units in the Klamath Mountains correlate with units in the Sierra Nevada foothills (Fig. 1; Scherer et al., 2006; Ernst et al., 2008; Ernst, 2013) as terranes now comprising both regions were amalgamated during numerous accretionary episodes in the late Paleozoic through early Mesozoic along the growing continental margin (Irwin and Wooden, 1999; Irwin, 2003). Large, shallowly E-dipping faults in the Klamath Mountains separate the different terranes that are predominantly oceanic in character, which is in contrast to the steeply E-dipping faults in the Sierra Nevada foothills. The metamorphosed terranes of the Klamath Mountains contain suturing plutons that crosscut terrane boundaries. Complementing the pluton ages with fossil ages provides estimates for the amalgamation events. Irwin (1960) initially defined four distinct major lithotectonic units in the Klamath Mountains, from east to west being the Eastern Klamath terrane, Central Metamorphic belt, Western Paleozoic and Triassic belt, and the Western Klamath terrane. Generally, the oldest rocks in each of these belts are on the western side and ages young to the east, suggestive of incremental amalgamation. Later recognition of independent terranes within the Western Paleozoic and Triassic belt prompted subdivision into the Northfork, Hayfork, and Rattlesnake Creek terranes (Irwin, 1972). Wright (1982) and Wright and Fahan (1988) further subdivided the Hayfork terrane into the eastern and western Hayfork terranes separated by the Wilson Point thrust.\nThe nucleus of the Klamath Mountains is formed by the Permian through Jurassic rocks of the Eastern Klamath terrane (Fig. 2\n), composed of multiple subterranes, including the ultramafic\u2013mafic Trinity subterrane (Wallin and Metcalf, 1998), eugeoclinal metasedimentary and minor volcanic rocks of the Yreka subterrane (Lindsley-Griffin et al., 2006, 2008), and the arc sequences and metasedimentary rocks of the Redding subterrane (Irwin, 1977). Likely during the late Silurian to Devonian (Irwin, 2003), the greenschist- through amphibolite-facies metabasite and metasedimentary rocks of the Central Metamorphic terrane (Barrow and Metcalf, 2006) were accreted to the Eastern Klamath terrane along the Bully Choop fault. This deformational episode led to emplacement of the 431\u2013404\u00a0Ma gabbroic intrusions in the Trinity subterrane (Wallin and Metcalf, 1998) and development of the arc rocks and the 400\u00a0Ma cogenetic Mule Mountain stock of the Redding subterrane (Albers et al., 1981).\nAfter a hiatus, terrane amalgamation resumed as the latest Paleozoic oceanic metabasalt and siliceous metasedimentary rocks of the Stuart Fork terrane (also known as the Fort Jones terrane; Goodge, 1990) were accreted and metamorphosed to blueschist facies during the late Paleozoic through Triassic (Irwin and Wooden, 1999; Irwin, 2003) or the Triassic (Goodge, 1990). No pre-accretionary intrusions are identified (Irwin, 2003), and the oldest intrusion within the Stuart Fork terrane is the\u00a0~\u00a0159\u00a0Ma Russian Peak pluton (Wright and Fahan, 1988). However, the 260\u00a0Ma Pit River stock (Fraticelli et al., 1985) located in the Redding subterrane has been interpreted to be a syn-accretionary pluton formed during the beginning stages of this orogenic event (Irwin, 2003). If this interpretation is correct, then this amalgamation event occurred over 40 million years, because blueschist-facies rocks of the Stuart Fork terrane have been dated at\u00a0~\u00a0220\u00a0Ma (Hotz et al., 1977) and indicate that this event was ongoing into the Triassic.\nThe Paleozoic through Jurassic oceanic rocks of the North Fork terrane are considered a forearc assemblage located westward of an early to middle Mesozoic arc system (Wright, 1982; Scherer and Ernst, 2008). Accretion of the North Fork terrane must have occurred prior to intrusion of the 164\u00a0Ma East Fork pluton (Irwin, 1985) and the 159\u00a0Ma Russian Peak pluton (Wright and Fahan, 1988), which both cut the Siskiyou fault representing the eastern terrane boundary. This interpretation is consistent with radiolarian chert fossils of Early Jurassic age (Blome and Irwin, 1983) that existed prior to terrane amalgamation onto the growing margin. Regional sub-greenschist to greenschist metamorphism occurred at 170\u2013165\u00a0Ma (Ernst, 1999).\nAccretion of the oceanic rocks of the Eastern Hayfork terrane was estimated to have occurred in the early Middle Jurassic along the Twin Sisters fault (Irwin, 2003) and more precisely prior to intrusion of the terrane suturing Uncles Creek pluton at\u00a0~\u00a0172\u00a0Ma (Ernst et al., 2016). Toarcian to Bajocian (182.7\u2013168.3\u00a0Ma) volcanic-sedimentary rocks of the Potem Formation found as the highest stratigraphic unit of the Redding subterrane (Sanborn, 1960) may further constrain the timing of this orogenic episode.\nThe pre-accretionary volcanic arc rocks of the Western Hayfork terrane are dated at 177\u2013168\u00a0Ma (Lanphere et al., 1968; Wright, 1981; Fahan, 1982) and are part of a composite terrane with the basement rocks of the Rattlesnake Creek terrane. Arc magmatism in the Western Hayfork terrane was terminated with thrusting of the Eastern Hayfork terrane over the Western Hayfork terrane, with the younger volcanic ages representing the maximum possible age for accretion with the Eastern Hayfork terrane along the Wilson Point thrust fault (Wright, 1982; Sullivan, 2009). Syn-accretionary plutons of this episode are limited in the Klamath Mountains but are numerous in the correlative rocks of the Sierra Nevada foothills, with ages as young as 166\u00a0Ma (Irwin, 2003). The underlying Rattlesnake Creek terrane m\u00e9lange unit is composed of a serpentinite matrix m\u00e9lange basement and overlying arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Irwin, 1972; Wright and Wyld, 1994). The Salt Creek thrust separates the Rattlesnake Creek terrane to the west from the Western Hayfork terrane to the east (Wright, 1982; Wright and Fahan, 1988) and is surmised to have accommodated only minor thrust displacement (Barnes and Barnes, 2020). Thrusting of the Rattlesnake Creek and Western Hayfork terranes below the Eastern Hayfork terrane took place during the Middle Jurassic Siskiyou orogeny that affected all terranes of the western Paleozoic and Triassic belt (Coleman et al., 1988). Regional folding, metamorphism, and granitic intrusion occurred during the thrusting.\nFinally, the Western Klamath terrane was accreted during the latest Jurassic as identified by suturing plutons ranging from 151 to 146\u00a0Ma that intruded the thrust faults separating it from the inboard Rattlesnake Creek terrane (Irwin, 2003). This thrusting event marks the Nevadan orogeny that predominantly affected rocks of the Western Klamath terrane (Gray, 2006). The transitional greenschist- to blueschist-facies rocks of the Condrey Mountain Schist located farther inboard have been interpreted as higher-pressure rocks of the Western Klamath terrane that were thrust under the Rattlesnake Creek terrane and are now an exposed window (Saleeby and Harper, 1993). The Condrey Mountain Schist is a composite unit composed of Late Jurassic through middle Cretaceous rocks that are separated by an internal fault within the unit (Saleeby and Harper, 1993; Snoke and Barnes, 2006). The structurally higher portion, which hosts an orogenic deposit described below, is composed of greenschist-facies mafic and subordinate silicic and graphitic quartz-mica schist with a protolith age of 172\u2013170\u00a0Ma (Helper et al., 1989; Saleeby and Harper, 1993). The structurally lower transitional blueschist-greenschist facies portion is dominated by quartzofeldspathic schist and metachert (Saleeby and Harper, 1993). The sedimentary protolith of the structurally lower portion has a maximum depositional age of 136\u00a0Ma based upon detrital zircon evidence (Coons, 2017), indicating a complex formation and underthrusting history of the Condrey Mountain Schist.\nLode gold deposits sampled for this study are located within the Eastern Klamath terrane, the Stuart Fork terrane, the North Fork terrane, the Eastern Hayfork terrane, and the Condrey Mountain Schist. These terranes in the Klamath Mountains are thought to correlate with terranes of the Sierra Nevada foothills such that the Northern Sierra terrane correlates with the Eastern Klamath terrane, the Red Ant Schist correlates with the Stuart Fork terrane, and the Calaveras Complex correlates with the North Fork and Eastern Hayfork terranes (Fig. 1; Irwin, 2003; Snow and Scherer, 2006). The most important gold-hosting terranes in the Sierra Nevada foothills are the Calaveras Complex and the Jura-Triassic arc belt.\n\n\n2.3\nGold deposits\nThe most significant lode gold deposits of the Klamath Mountains occur in the southeast near the town of Redding in California (Fig. 2). The northern Klamath Mountains lode gold deposits in Oregon are generally smaller and do not appear to be spatially associated with the large, terrane-bounding suture zones (Hotz, 1971a).\nThe gold-bearing quartz or quartz-carbonate veins of the Klamath Mountains are 0.3\u20132.5\u00a0m wide. Most of the veins are steeply dipping, although veins of gentle inclination are observed. Gold in the vein deposits is typically in its native form (Clark, 1970). The majority of veins are found within the metamorphosed marine sedimentary and volcanic rocks, with lesser amounts hosted within granitic intrusions. A strong association between high gold grades and carbonaceous wall rocks has been long noted (Ferguson, 1915). Generally, the sulfide mineral content of the veins is low (less than 3 to 5 %) and is composed predominantly of pyrite with lesser amounts of arsenopyrite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, molybdenite, and telluride minerals. Common gangue minerals include quartz, carbonate minerals, chlorite, and white mica. White mica is typically associated with sulfide minerals formed during ore formation.\n\n\n\n3\nStudy sites\n\n3.1\nWashington deposit, French Gulch-Deadwood district\nThe French Gulch-Deadwood district was the most productive gold district in the Klamath Mountains, having produced between 800,000 and 1,500,000\u00a0oz from both lode and placer deposits (Jenks and Tregaskis, 2007). The lode deposits are located along an E-W-trending fracture system within the clastic rocks of the Bragdon Formation and the Copley Greenstone unit of the Eastern Klamath terrane and are found on the hanging wall sides of the Spring Creek thrust and the Bully Choop thrust. However, a notable exception is the Dean vein, which is hosted entirely within metavolcanic rocks. Numerous hydrothermally altered dikes and sills occur in the mineralized zone. Total historical gold production from the Washington deposit, which consists of at least six veins, is estimated to be 300,000\u00a0oz (Shasta Gold Corp., 2008).\nMost of the veins in the Washington deposit strike NE-SW. Quartz veins that strike N-S are rare in the Washington deposit, and those veins may contain idiomorphic Fe-bearing clinozoisite (Fig. 3\nA). Muscovite is present in fractures and open spaces and is coarser than any other observed during this study (Fig. 3A and 4A). Muscovite is hosted within fractures and between idiomorphic quartz crystals, indicating precipitation after quartz (Fig. 4\nB). Gold precipitation also postdates quartz deposition and is predominantly associated with pyrite, sphalerite, and galena.\n\n\n3.2\nYankee John deposit, Redding district\nThe deposits of the Redding district are hosted within the 400\u00a0Ma Mule Mountain Granite, which is a quartz diorite-trondjhemite stock (Albers et al., 1981), and in the surrounding country rock metabasalt to meta-andesite Copley Greenstone and Balaklala Rhyolite of the Eastern Klamath terrane. The district is located on the hanging wall side of the N-S trending Bully Choop fault. The NE-striking, steeply SE-dipping parallel veins of white quartz at Yankee John average 1.5\u20132\u00a0m in width, with an average grade of 0.6\u00a0oz\/t (Averill 1933; Lydon and O\u2019Brien, 1974). They were formed in the Copley Greenstone near the intersection of a NW-trending and a SW-trending fault (Strand, 1962; Irwin, 1994). Muscovite, chlorite, and sulfide minerals preferentially occur within fractures in the quartz vein (Fig. 4C).\n\n\n3.3\nWalker deposit, Old Diggings (Buckeye) district\nThe Old Diggings district is to the NNE of the Mule Mountain stock in the Eastern Klamath terrane on the hanging wall side of the Bully Choop thrust fault. Much of the country rock in the district is Devonian Copley Greenstone metabasalt (Clark, 1970). Mapped N-S-trending bodies of Devonian Balaklala Rhyolite are found within the Copley Greenstone in the immediate vicinity of the Walker deposit (Strand, 1962; Irwin, 1994). At least six subparallel veins are known at the Walker deposit, which strike southwest and dip 60\u00b0 to the northwest (Averill, 1939). Veins can range from approximately 1\u00a0m to greater than 10\u00a0m in width. Within the quartz veins, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and associated muscovite occur in masses and as fracture fill within the quartz (Fig. 4D). Gold is associated with pyrite and chalcopyrite (Lydon and O\u2019Brien, 1974).\n\n\n3.4\nMcKeen deposit, Callahan district\nThe Callahan district is known for the substantial amounts of placer gold recovered from gravel benches, although numerous lode deposits also exist. The McKeen lode gold deposit (also known as the Cummings deposit) of the Callahan district is hosted within the northern part of the Craggy Peak pluton found on the hanging wall side of the Trinity thrust fault (Fig. 3B). The pluton yielded U-Pb zircon crystallization ages ranging from 141\u00a0Ma (reported in Barnes et al., 1996) to 138.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma (Allen and Barnes, 2006) and a K-Ar biotite cooling age of ca. 136\u00a0Ma (Lanphere et al., 1968). The Craggy Peak pluton was emplaced into the Trinity subterrane of the Eastern Klamath terrane, which mostly comprises serpentinized peridotite. The shape of the pluton is suggestive of structurally controlled emplacement (Petersen, 1993).\nAt least four veins are known from the McKeen deposit, but only one has been developed and averages 0.6\u00a0m in width, trends 035\u00b0, and dips 85\u00b0 to the southeast (Logan, 1925; Averill, 1931). Nearly 25,000\u00a0oz of gold have been produced from the McKeen deposit, making it the second most productive mine in the district behind the Dewey deposit, which is also hosted by the Craggy Peak pluton (Hotz, 1971a). Most of the other deposits in the district are located outside of the Craggy Peak pluton within the serpentinite country rocks.\nFormation of the quartz-carbonate veins at the McKeen deposit was associated with the widespread alteration of feldspar and biotite in the pluton and the formation of secondary muscovite, calcite, and clay minerals (Fig. 3C). Primary biotite is replaced by muscovite adjacent to the veins, but it is only partially chloritized away from the veins.\n\n\n3.5\nHickey deposit, Liberty district\nApproximately 300,000\u00a0oz of lode gold are estimated to have been produced from the Liberty district (Ferrero, 1990). It is the second most productive lode gold producing district in the Klamath Mountains, behind the French Gulch-Deadwood district. The deposits of the Liberty district, including the Hickey deposit, are mostly situated within the Soap Creek Ridge thrust fault, a shear zone that separates the siliceous schist of the overlying Stuart Fork terrane from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the underthrust North Fork terrane to the north and west. Most of the quartz veins in the district strike north to northeast with moderate to steep east and southeast dips, which is parallel to the general trend of the Soap Creek Ridge thrust fault in the district (Hotz, 1971a). Schist represents the main host rock for the Hickey deposit. The average ore grade was 0.16\u00a0oz\/t (Averill, 1935).\n\n\n3.6\nQuartz Hill deposit, Scott Bar district\nThe Quartz Hill lode gold deposit is located in the Condrey Mountain Schist footwall immediately adjacent to a N-S-trending portion of the Condrey Mountain thrust fault boundary with the Eastern Hayfork terrane (Fig. 2). The host rock of the deposit is the structurally higher greenschist-facies micaceous schist of the Condrey Mountain Schist.\nA large system of NE-striking quartz veins and lenses with rich pockets of gold is located at Quartz Hill (Averill, 1931; O\u2019Brien, 1947). The gold-bearing veins contain abundant ankerite. Schist fragments incorporated into the veins are highly sulfidized. These altered clasts contain abundant pyrite, carbonate, muscovite, and quartz, with minor molybdenite. The highest concentration of pyrite and molybdenite is found associated with muscovite (Fig. 4G). Both Au- and Ag-bearing tellurides have been identified.\n\n\n3.7\nSchroeder deposit, Yreka-Fort Jones district\nThe Schroeder deposit is hosted within metabasalt of the North Fork terrane, immediately south of the Vesa Bluffs pluton. The Schroeder deposit is located approximately halfway between the mapped fault\/contact separating the Eastern Hayfork terrane from the North Fork terrane to the north and the closely spaced high-angle, S-dipping Greenhorn reverse and SE-dipping Soap Creek Ridge thrust faults to the south (Irwin, 1994). These faults strike to the east to east-northeast in this area. Multiple lithologies are present in the waste pile at the Schroeder deposit, including various types of intrusive rocks, but altered basalt represents the dominant lithology. The main\u00a0~\u00a02.5\u00a0m wide orebody strikes 080\u00b0 and dips 60\u201370\u00b0 to the south with an average grade of 0.43\u00a0oz\/ton (Averill, 1931). The veins display a laminated texture formed by different parallel generations of quartz precipitation (Fig. 3D). Slickensides on the vein margins indicate movement during or after formation. Veins and altered intrusive rocks contain abundant hydrothermal muscovite (Fig. 4H). The muscovite is coarsest near vein margins and formed as a result of feldspar alteration.\n\n\n3.8\nMcKinley deposit, Humbug district\nThe Humbug district is close to the Yreka-Fort Jones district. Similar to the Schroeder deposit, the McKinley deposit is located within metabasalt of the North Fork terrane just to the south of the Vesa Bluffs pluton. The McKinley deposit is approximately 2\u00a0km to the NNE of the Schroeder deposit, placing it closer to the fault\/contact between the Eastern Hayfork and North Fork terranes. Adits and waste piles at the deposit are in an E-W-trending drainage that could represent a smaller, unmapped fault. Muscovite is present within fractures crosscutting the quartz (Fig. 4I).\n\n\n\n4\nMaterials and methods\nSamples of quartz and quartz-carbonate veins and the adjacent hydrothermally altered host rocks were collected from the gold deposits of the Klamath Mountains described above (Table 1\n). Because only a single gold deposit in the Klamath Mountains had been previously dated (Elder and Cashman, 1992), the sampling strategy attempted to obtain numerous vein samples from deposits located throughout the Klamath Mountains to determine the duration of lode gold formation throughout the range and compare results to the well-documented period of gold mineralization in the Sierra Nevada foothills gold province. In addition to the deposits listed in Table 1, other deposits were examined during our field program. However, no materials suitable for geochronological study were obtained from these other occurrences.\nInitial petrographic examination aided in identifying samples with white mica of sufficient size that could be hand-picked (Fig. 4). These samples were crushed and sieved to 150\u2013250 and 250\u2013355\u00a0\u00b5m-size fractions using standard techniques. Both fractions were placed in an ultrasonic bath to remove conjoined mineral phases, then washed in distilled water and acetone to remove clay minerals and other fine particles. Individual muscovite grains were then handpicked under a binocular microscope from the two size fractions to ensure purity.\nThe composition of the separated white mica was determined using a JEOL 8900 electron microprobe with five wavelength dispersive analyzers to verify their chemical composition at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Denver, Colorado. Operating conditions for the analysis were 15\u00a0keV accelerating voltage, a 20nA current (measured on the Faraday cup), and a focused electron beam. Calibration was performed using a combination of silicate and oxide standards. Detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 0.16\u00a0wt% for all elements.\nThe muscovite separates were dated by 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology in the Western Australia Argon Isotope Facility at Curtin University, Perth, Australia, and at the USGS Argon Geochronology Laboratory in Denver, Colorado. Samples were first analyzed with a Mass Analyzer Products 215\u201350 mass spectrometer coupled with a NewWave Nd YAG dual IR and UV laser at Curtin University, with the IR laser model being used for analyses. Samples analyzed at Curtin were run using GA1550 neutron fluence monitor and decay constants calibrated by Renne et al. (2011). Many of the samples were reanalyzed at the USGS Argon Geochronology Laboratory by incremental heating using a 30-W CO2 laser equipped with a homogenizing lens and analyzed by a Thermo Scientific ARGUS VI mass spectrometer. Comparison of multi-laboratory results helped identify problematic argon release of some samples and allowed further refinement of age spectra interpretations. At the USGS Argon Geochronology Laboratory, Fish Canyon sanidine (28.201\u00a0Ma; Kuiper et al., 2008) was used as a neutron fluence monitor, along with decay constants from Min et al. (2000). Data from the Western Australia Argon Facility at Curtin University were converted to Kuiper et al. (2008) and Min et al. (2000) values to allow for direct comparison.\nAge spectra must have at least three contiguous heating steps within analytical uncertainty of each other that released a minimum of 70 % of the cumulative argon to be considered as an age plateau. Argon release patterns were inspected for evidence of disturbance by argon loss or excess argon (Turner, 1968; Lanphere and Dalrymple, 1976; Lee, 2015). The size of the muscovite mineral separates was sufficient to negate any 39Ar recoil effects, and no evidence of this was found within the age spectra. Many of the samples display larger uncertainties in the higher-temperature steps because these are low-gas steps with little Ar left to degas.\n\n\n5\nResults\nComplete in situ geochemical results of white mica separates are available in a USGS data release by Taylor (2020). All separated white mica crystals are near the muscovite endmember composition with minor celadonite or biotite substitution. Summary geochronological results are presented in Table 2\n, and complete data are provided in Supplementary data Tables 1 and 2. The 40Ar\/39Ar age spectra were evaluated for samples hosted in the Eastern Klamath terrane (Fig. 5\n) and for samples hosted in the Stuart Fork terrane, North Fork terrane, or Condrey Mountain Schist (Fig. 6\n). Differences in age spectra for multiple aliquots from the same sample are minor and can be attributed to subtle alteration or multiple populations of muscovite of slightly different ages that formed during the mineralization process. A single instance where multiple populations of differing age occur, or where inherited components were retained within the crystals, is further considered in the discussion section. Data for the samples analyzed at the U.S. Geological Survey Argon Geochronology Laboratory are reported in a USGS data release by Morgan (2020). Mean square weighted deviation (MSWD) for the data ranges from 0.19 to 1.96 and the p-value (P) ranges from 0.06 to 1.0.\nMuscovite from the N-S-trending vein sample (Dean 3NS) at the Washington deposit is coarser than any of the samples collected in this study (Figs. 3 and 4). Three 40Ar\/39Ar analyses were completed with only one providing a plateau age of 288.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.66\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06) that included 73.43 % of the 39Ar released (Fig. 5; Table 2). The other two aliquot analyses show higher levels of radiogenic 40Ar (40Ar*) loss and failed to produce spectra with defined plateaus.\nThe NE-SW-striking vein sample (1945) from the Washington deposit was analyzed twice and resulted in two plateau ages of 138.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.98) and 140.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.95), both including 100 % of the 39Ar released (Fig. 5; Table 2). Both ages are within uncertainty of each other and provide a calculated weighted mean age of 139.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.12\u00a0Ma (Table 3\n) using IsoplotR (Vermeesch, 2018).\nMuscovite from the Yankee John deposit provided three different plateau dates of 152.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.27), 153\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a01.0), and 142.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.98\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.85) including 92.4 %, 100 %, and 100 % of the 39Ar released, respectively (Table 2). The 153\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0Ma plateau age has a large uncertainty due to lower gas release. The 152.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma plateau age is considered the preferred age because the date of\u00a0~\u00a0142\u00a0Ma is mostly based on a single step accounting for 91.99 % of the 39Ar released that could mask 40Ar* loss. This is in contrast to the age of\u00a0~\u00a0152\u00a0Ma, which is based on an even release pattern accounting for 92.4 % of the cumulative 39Ar released over 12 steps (Fig. 5).\nThe vein material from the Walker deposit was strongly deformed. The quartz displays characteristic textures of dynamic recrystallization similar to that of the Hickey deposit (Fig. 4D). In total, four analyses were attempted to obtain an age (Fig. 5). One analysis did not produce a plateau date but had individual steps ranging from\u00a0~\u00a0335 to 265\u00a0Ma. Another analysis (shown in red in Fig. 5) that did not produce a plateau date had individual steps ranging from\u00a0~\u00a0307 to 140\u00a0Ma. This spectra displays a saddle-shaped profile that may indicate the presence of excess 40Ar with the minimum dates of the spectra approaching a geologically meaningful age. A third analysis did not produce a plateau but had apparent step dates ranging from\u00a0~\u00a0300 to 250\u00a0Ma. A fourth analysis produced a plateau date of 154.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.20) over 13 steps accounting for 73.71 % of the cumulative 39Ar released yet has early steps showing a much older apparent date of\u00a0~\u00a0320\u00a0Ma. All four of the analyses have a\u00a0~\u00a0320\u2013290\u00a0Ma component, whereas two of the analyses have a\u00a0~\u00a0150\u00a0Ma component.\nThree argon analyses of the hydrothermal muscovite from the McKeen deposit provided plateau ages of 141.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.31), 137.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.99), and 144\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.97), including 98.97 %, 100 %, and 100 % of the total 39Ar released, respectively (Fig. 5; Table 2). The 137.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma plateau is characterized by an argon release profile where more than 80 % of the cumulative argon was released during the second heating step (Fig. 5).\nThe quartz veins of the Hickey deposit are the most deformed samples collected during this study. The quartz is highly deformed and recrystallized, displaying deformation lamellae and lobate intergrowth as well as evidence for subgrain rotation recrystallization and grain boundary migration (Fig. 4F). Three argon analyses were evaluated, and none produced a plateau age (Fig. 6). All three analyses yield a similar increasing log-shaped Fickian diffusion profile that may indicate some amount of argon disturbance (McDougall and Harrison, 1999).\nThree different analyses of muscovite from the Quartz Hill deposit produced three plateau dates of 144.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.15), 140.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.56), and 136.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.76), including 86.48 %, 77.04 %, and 73.53 % of the total 39Ar released, respectively (Fig. 6; Table 2). All three plateaus were heavily reliant upon the argon released during either one or two steps. Among the three apparent dates, there is a clear inverse correlation between the amount of 40Ar* loss and the date returned by the plateau, meaning that samples more affected by Ar loss converge toward younger apparent dates at high temperature of extraction. As such, the 144.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma plateau date is considered here as the best approximation of the crystallization age of the muscovite because it accounted for a larger percentage of the cumulative 39Ar release and was not as reliant upon a single step as the other plateau ages.\nThree different plateaus were produced for muscovite from the Schroeder deposit with dates of 159.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.94\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.79), 159.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.64), and 158.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.21) including 100 %, 85.22 %, and 73.65 % of the 39Ar released, respectively (Fig. 6; Table 2). All were within analytical uncertainty of each other, and a weighted mean age of 159.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u00a0Ma was calculated.\nTwo analyses of muscovite from the McKinley deposit resulted in plateau dates of 155.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.75) and 152.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0Ma (P\u00a0=\u00a01.0), both including 100 % of the 39Ar released (Fig. 6; Table 2). Both dates are within analytical uncertainty of each other and provide a calculated weighted mean age of 155.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.76\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nInterpretation of obtained ages\nThe closure temperature for argon diffusion in muscovite is commonly considered to be\u00a0~\u00a0350\u00a0\u00b0C (Hodges, 1991) but has been experimentally shown to be higher for muscovite crystals formed and cooled in many environments (Harrison et al., 2009). The formation temperature for most Phanerozoic orogenic gold deposits is estimated at 250\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C within rocks on a retrograde metamorphic path (Goldfarb et al., 2005). Stable isotope data for the deposits in the Sierra Nevada foothills indicate temperatures between 300 and 350\u00a0\u00b0C (B\u00f6hlke and Kistler, 1986), whereas fluid inclusion microthermometry at the Grass Valley deposits indicates hydrothermal fluid temperatures of less than 280\u00a0\u00b0C (Taylor et al., 2021). This suggests that the 40Ar\/39Ar ages obtained in this study record the timing of hydrothermal muscovite formation and hence vein formation. The obtained ages, therefore, provide reliable new critical insights into the absolute timing of the formation of orogenic gold deposits in the Klamath Mountains.\nBoth the Schroeder and McKinley deposits are hosted within metabasalt to the south of but near to the Vesa Bluffs pluton. The weighted mean mineralization age of 159.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u00a0Ma for the Schroeder deposit and 155.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.76\u00a0Ma mineralization age for the McKinley deposit are distinct from each other and suggest discrete hydrothermal pulses in the adjacent Humbug and Yreka-Fort Jones districts over a period of at least a few million years duration. Hydrothermal events at\u00a0~\u00a0159 and 155\u00a0Ma are significantly younger than the 167.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0Ma Vesa Bluffs pluton (zircon U-Pb: Allen and Barnes, 2006). The hydrothermal events responsible for mineralization south of the Vesa Bluffs pluton are thus unlikely to be genetically related to the pluton because a magmatic-hydrothermal system cannot be sustained for such a time period (e.g., Cathles et al., 1997). Both vein systems trend approximately parallel to the Greenhorn reverse fault and Soap Creek Ridge thrust fault.\nThe Yankee John and Walker deposits are found close to the 400\u00a0Ma Mule Mountain stock but solely in the surrounding metabasalt of the Eastern Klamath terrane. The NE-striking veins at Yankee John formed at 152.1\u00a0Ma and show slickensides along the vein margins. A hydrothermal event forming NE-trending veins at the Walker deposit occurred between\u00a0~\u00a0155 and 150\u00a0Ma, based upon a plateau age at 154.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma and another analysis displaying evidence for excess 40Ar having components of a\u00a0~\u00a0150\u00a0Ma event interpreted from the minimum ages of the saddle-shaped profile. The age relationships and similarity in vein orientation are suggestive of a regional tectonic control on mineralization. An additional late Carboniferous-early Permian event is recorded in the data for the Walker deposit as discussed below.\nThe 288\u00a0Ma plateau date for the N-trending vein sample (Dean 3NS) from the Washington deposit and the\u00a0~\u00a0300\u00a0Ma secondary date component for the NE-trending Walker deposit are far younger than the late Silurian-Early Devonian accretion of the Central Metamorphic terrane and are older than the Permian to Triassic Fort Jones terrane accretion (Goodge, 1990; Irwin and Wooden, 1999; Irwin, 2003). Furthermore, no plutonic events within the Eastern Klamath terrane correlate with these early Permian dates (Irwin, 1985, 2003). This district is located northwest of the 400\u00a0Ma Mule Mountain stock (Albers et al., 1981) and northeast of the 136\u00a0Ma Shasta Bally batholith (Lanphere and Jones, 1978). The early Permian date of these samples is also significantly younger than the Devonian massive sulfide ores hosted in the Balaklala Rhyolite in the nearby West Shasta Cu-Zn district (Albers and Bain, 1985; Howe, 1985). Barrow and Metcalf (2006) report two anomalously young 40Ar\/39Ar cooling ages of 274\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for Devonian amphibolite from the Central Metamorphic terrane near the Trinity fault; the young ages are interpreted to represent uplift of the Central Metamorphic terrane during extension but are considerably younger than the anomalous early Permian components of the N-striking (Dean3NS) Washington and Walker samples. At this point, the significance of the early Permian dates is unknown because there is no clear age correlation with magmatic or tectonic activity. Furthermore, the overall problematic argon spectra for the numerous analyses make interpretations difficult. However, the occurrence of multiple deposits hosted in the Eastern Klamath terrane that have components of an early Permian date suggest some thermal event did affect the host rocks at that time. Alternatively, a population of pre-ore muscovite derived from the host rock was possibly incorporated into the veins and mixed with hydrothermal muscovite to provide these erroneous ages. Regardless, the pre-amalgamation date indicates that the components cannot be related to an orogenic gold-forming event. In contrast, the weighted mean age of 139.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.12\u00a0Ma determined for the NE-striking vein sample from the Washington deposit and the 154.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma plateau age for the Walker deposit sample coincide with known gold-forming events elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada foothills.\nThe 139.68\u00a0Ma age for the NE-striking vein sample from the Washington deposit is among the youngest of the ages obtained in this study and is similar to the age determined for the McKeen deposit. The altered quartz diorite and diorite \u201cbirds-eye\u201d porphyry dikes of the French Gulch district are spatially associated with the gold-bearing quartz veins and have been interpreted as hypabyssal offshoots of the 136\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma Shasta Bally batholith (Albers, 1965; Lanphere and Jones, 1978). Other workers suggested that these porphyry dikes may be older than the Shasta Bally batholith based upon deformation and intrusive contacts (Jenks and Tregaskis, 2007). Silberman and Danielson (1991) presented preliminary K-Ar geochronological data suggesting that some of the \u201cbirds-eye\u201d porphyry dikes were emplaced at ca. 160\u00a0Ma and that some quartz porphyry dikes in the area are ca. 135\u00a0Ma in age. Porphyritic dikes and sills on the Washington property are interpreted to have been emplaced prior to or synchronously with the quartz veins (Jenks and Tregaskis, 2007). Assuming that the hydrothermal event resulting in the formation of the NE-striking veins is responsible for alteration of these porphyry dikes, then the dikes must have been present prior to the ore-forming event. This timing works whether the dikes formed at 160\u00a0Ma or are associated as offshoots of the younger Shasta Bally batholith because the mineralization ages are within error of the age of the Shasta Bally batholith. The Washington deposit is one of only two deposits in this study to have an age that overlaps that of nearby intrusions.\nThe structurally higher external unit of the Condrey Mountain Schist hosts the Quartz Hill deposit, but the deposit is located in close proximity to the Condrey Mountain thrust fault. The protolith to the ore-hosting schist is dated at\u00a0~\u00a0172\u2013170\u00a0Ma, with metamorphism beginning\u00a0~\u00a0160\u00a0Ma (Helper et al., 1989; Saleeby and Harper, 1993). At approximately 160\u00a0Ma, thrusting of the Rattlesnake Creek terrane over the Condrey Mountain Schist along the Condrey fault began, with peak metamorphism along the thrust occurring at 157\u00a0+\u00a03\/-2 Ma and the end of amphibolite grade metamorphism and deformation of the upper plate rocks occurring at 152\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Saleeby and Harper, 1993). However, other metamorphic ages (Rb-Sr, K-Ar) of the Condrey Mountain Schist range from Late Jurassic to middle Cretaceous (Helper et al., 1989; Hacker et al., 1995) and a maximum depositional age for the structurally lower internal unit is 136\u00a0Ma (Coons, 2017). This indicates that deep-seated underthrusting of portions of the Condrey Mountain Schist continued well into the Cretaceous. All three hydrothermal muscovite plateau ages are within the broad range of metamorphic cooling ages that previous researchers have measured for the large exposure of Condrey Mountain Schist (Helper et al., 1989; Saleeby and Harper, 1993; Hacker et al., 1995). However, the spectra forming plateaus at\u00a0~\u00a0136\u00a0Ma and 141\u00a0Ma have a single step that controls the plateaus and masks the increasing staircase spectra. These two spectra appear to have been partially affected by 40Ar* loss. In a scenario where the 144.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma could be considered a cooling age, then the maximum hydrothermal age would be constrained by initial movement on the Condrey thrust and would thus bracket the age of mineralization between\u00a0~\u00a0160 and 144\u00a0Ma. However, a preferred plateau age of\u00a0~\u00a0144\u00a0Ma for the hydrothermal event is plausible and fits within the range of other ages determined in this study.\nThe age of mineralization at the McKeen deposit of 141.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma is indistinguishable from that of the host Craggy Peak pluton (141 to 138.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma; Barnes et al., 1996; Allen and Barnes, 2006). This is the interpreted age of hydrothermal mineralization (Table 3) because the\u00a0~\u00a0138\u00a0Ma plateau is characterized by an argon release problem, and the other plateau is within uncertainty of the interpreted age but with a large associated error (Fig. 5). Considering the crosscutting and brittle nature of the veins, they must have formed subsequent to emplacement and solidification of the hosting pluton. Most other lode deposits in the Callahan district are hosted by the serpentinite country rocks, although the McKeen deposit itself is located near the lithologic contact. The competency contrast between the two units was likely a preferential zone controlling fluid flow and a structural trap for mineralization to occur in the brittle intrusive rock.\nThe spectra derived for the Hickey deposit is disturbed and does not provide an age estimate; however, a relative age of deposit formation can be constrained by geologic relations. The Hickey and other deposits of the Liberty district are associated with the Soap Creek Ridge thrust that represents the suture zone between the North Fork terrane to the west and the Stuart Fork terrane to the east. This suturing event at 170\u2013165\u00a0Ma resulted in regional sub-greenschist to greenschist facies metamorphism (Ernst, 1999). The 159\u00a0Ma zircon age of the Russian Peak pluton (Wright and Fahan, 1988) and the 164\u00a0Ma\u00a0K-Ar biotite age of the East Fork pluton (Irwin, 1985) that were intruded into the Soap Creek Ridge thrust further confirm the timing of terrane accretion. The argon spectra derived from the Hickey sample likely includes an excess argon problem, as suggested by the log-shaped profile, because the age of 170\u2013165\u00a0Ma would geologically be the maximum age of mineralization. As with the older apparent ages for the Washington and Walker deposits, a population of pre-ore muscovite was possibly incorporated into the veins. However, this is unlikely for the Hickey deposit since petrographic or argon data for this scenario are lacking.\n\n\n6.2\nTiming of regional magmatism and mineralization\nPlutonic activity within the Klamath Mountains terranes ranges from Ordovician through Early Cretaceous, although arc magmatism was most abundant between 174 and 140\u00a0Ma with the number of dated plutons peaking prior to gold mineralization at\u00a0~\u00a0170\u2013160\u00a0Ma (Irwin and Wooden, 1999). The character of the Middle Jurassic through Early Cretaceous plutons shows a temporal distinction. Geochemical and isotopic evidence indicates that pre-Nevadan plutons incorporated metasedimentary rock crustal melts into their magmas, whereas post-Nevadan plutons derived their character from partial melting of underthrust oceanic rocks (Barnes et al., 1992). The close spatial relationship between many gold deposits and these granitic intrusions and their related dikes (Hotz, 1971a; Silberman and Danielson, 1991) led to magmatic-hydrothermal models for gold genesis (Clark, 1970; Hotz, 1971a). However, the new age data make a direct genetic connection between magmatism and gold mineralization tenuous. Data are more consistent with a metamorphic-hydrothermal model related to orogeny as supported by geologic mapping (Elder and Cashman, 1992), fluid inclusion microthermometric analyses (Elder and Cashman, 1992; Taylor et al., 2021), and geochemical studies (Snow et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2015) of similar gold deposits elsewhere in California.\nThe time of gold mineralization within the Klamath Mountains overlaps with the period of Middle Jurassic through Early Cretaceous magmatism but occurred after the peak magmatic period from\u00a0~\u00a0170\u2013160\u00a0Ma. The McKeen and Washington deposits, however, do have a temporal overlap with local magmatism, with both deposits forming toward the end of the 20 million-year-long gold mineralization period in the Klamath Mountains during a time of minor magmatism. All other sampled deposits may be located adjacent to plutons but have large age discrepancies with the magmatism. In general, there is no well-defined correlation between magmatic activity and Jurassic-Cretaceous gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains or Sierra Nevada foothills of California (Fig. 7\n).\nOrogenic gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains is not associated with any specific episode of magmatism defined by previous researchers (Lanphere et al., 1968; Hotz, 1971b; Allen and Barnes, 2006; Snoke and Barnes, 2006). Gold mineralization is pre-, syn-, and post-Nevadan thrusting despite the disparate geochemical character of pre- and post-Nevadan plutons noted by Barnes et al. (1992). Melt sources and chemistry of intrusions had no bearing on the formation of the gold deposits of the Klamath Mountains.\nAn interesting pattern regarding widespread occurrences of Late Jurassic plutonism and gold mineralization does, however, exist in California. The regions of Grass Valley and the Klamath Mountains that host older Late Jurassic through earliest Cretaceous orogenic gold deposits are also regions with Middle to Late Jurassic plutons, both indicative of high regional heat flow. The regions of younger orogenic gold mineralization in the Sierra Nevada foothills, such as the Bagby, Confidence, and Coulterville districts, and the Mother Lode Belt, are areas that lack significant Late Jurassic-Cretaceous plutonism (Fig. 8\n). Nevertheless, within a few kilometers to tens of kilometers to the east, a thermal event in the Sierra Nevada foothills may be marked by the onset of Sierra Nevada batholith emplacement at ca. 125\u00a0Ma.\nThis spatial and broad temporal relationship between Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous gold mineralization and magmatism should not be overlooked. The Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada formed a single contiguous arc through the initial seaward offset of the Klamath Mountains beginning at ca. 140\u2013135\u00a0Ma. The broad spatial and temporal link between magmatism and orogenic gold mineralization on the arc margins has been noted in many orogenic gold provinces throughout the world (Goldfarb et al., 2001, 2005). This relationship within the orogeny continued until complete lateral offset of the Klamath Mountains from the Sierra Nevada, when arc activity, including gold mineralization and magmatism, was terminated and deposition of the Valanginian shoreline markers occurred in the Klamath Mountains. Both the magmatism and the metamorphism, the latter sourcing the ore fluids and metals in most modern-day genetic models for orogenic gold, are products of a regional thermal event within an active continental margin, although melt emplacement and metamorphic fluid migration need not occur simultaneously. An offset in ages, with older ages of peak metamorphism of host rocks and younger ages of hydrothermal events, is a common to ubiquitous feature of orogenic gold deposits as orogenic belts are uplifted during changing far-field stresses (Goldfarb et al., 2005). It is also worth noting that arc magmatism and gold formation both ceased after ca. 140\u2013136\u00a0Ma in the Klamath Mountains but underwent renewed activity in the Sierra Nevada foothills beginning at ca. 130\u2013125\u00a0Ma (Marsh et al., 2008).\nBeyond the age discrepancies between magmatism and gold deposit formation outlined above, geologic and geochemical characteristics also indicate a genetic connection between gold mineralization and magmatism is untenable. A reduced intrusion-related origin for gold deposits may commonly be invoked within accretionary origins, but these tend to be low grade and large tonnage; are characterized by ore found in thin sheeted veins in competent granitic cupola; and are genetically associated with plutons with specific geochemical characteristics such as generally being ilmenite-series metaluminous plutons that can be alkalic (Hart, 2005; Hart and Goldfarb, 2005). The Klamath Mountains deposits do not show any of these types of features.\n\n\n6.3\nTectonic and metallogenic relations\nFormation of orogenic gold deposits is a consequence of focused fluid flow through major fault systems and vein precipitation in subordinate faults controlled by tectonic events and changes in stress (Goldfarb et al., 2005). The Californian deposits are spatially associated with terrane-suturing faults on the western edge of the North American plate and formed during much of the Mesozoic subduction\/accretion associated with the convergent Farallon plate. Most of the ages from this study and from previous studies (Tables 3 and 4\n) are Late Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous, signifying widespread gold formation within central and northern California during this time. At ca. 160\u00a0Ma, coincident with initial gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains, the arc axis moved trenchward with the formation of the Rogue Chetco arc in the Western Klamath terrane (Harper, 2006), which places orogenic gold formation in the province within a back-arc position.\nOrogenic gold mineralization in the Sierra Nevada foothills has been linked to movement and consequent hydrothermal fluid flow on the large terrane-bounding thrust fault systems, which were reactivated with translational motion (Elder and Cashman, 1992; Jia et al., 2003; Goldfarb et al., 2008; Marsh et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2015, 2021). An equivalency between formation mechanisms of the Sierra Nevada foothills deposits and the only previously dated gold deposit in the Klamath Mountains, the Morrison-Carlock deposit, has been suggested based on fluid compositions, mineralogy, alteration, and structural similarities (Elder and Cashman, 1992). Formation was attributed to the upflow of metamorphic-hydrothermal fluids along the terrane-bounding Soap Creek Ridge fault at ca. 147\u00a0Ma because of the stress field realignment caused by plate motion changes. Far-field stress changes are invoked in the formation of many orogenic gold provinces around the world since large-scale tectonic-structural responses necessary for orogenic gold mineralization are dependent upon the realignment of stress fields (Miller et al., 1994; Groves et al., 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2001).\nThe\u00a0~\u00a0160\u2013140\u00a0Ma period of gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains spans a period of regional extension from\u00a0~\u00a0164 through 157\u2013155\u00a0Ma; the compressional Nevadan orogeny from\u00a0~\u00a0157\u2013150\u00a0Ma; and a period of crustal relaxation with uplift and extension, which also included minor magmatism, metamorphism, and deformation that lasted until\u00a0~\u00a0135\u00a0Ma. Terrane underthrusting during post-Nevadan time continued into the Cretaceous, as evidenced by detrital zircon ages in the interior blueschist-greenschist facies Condrey Mountain Schist (Coons, 2017).\nNevertheless, within these regional tectonic regimes, differences that occurred on a local scale were also significant. For example, Hacker et al. (1995) looked at the distribution of late Middle Jurassic plutons to suggest that at ca. 160\u00a0Ma there was extension in the north-central Klamath Mountains and that the southern region lacked extensional features. This interpretation was further supported by Barnes and Allen (2006) who suggested the same based upon pressures and depth of emplacement of hydrous garnet-bearing andesitic dikes in the southern Klamath Mountains. Farther to the south in the active arc at 160\u00a0Ma, the Grass Valley district of the northern Sierra Nevada foothills was interpreted to have developed within a compressional regime (Hodgson, 1989; Bierlein et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2015). Ingersoll and Schweickert (1986) interpreted Middle to Late Jurassic differential stress regimes resulting from the localized collision of intraoceanic arc leading to compression to the south (Sierra Nevada) and extension in the north (Klamath Mountains). Thus, the Nevadan accretionary orogeny was likely diachronous with collision occurring first in the south in the northern Sierra Nevada foothills at 163\u2013160\u00a0Ma (Day et al., 1985; Tobisch et al., 1989; Wolf and Saleeby, 1995) and zippering northwards during the intervening time into the Klamath Mountains and onset of orogeny at\u00a0~\u00a0157\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8).\nThe earliest orogenic gold mineralization in California at both the Schroeder deposit in the Klamath Mountains and Grass Valley deposits in the northernmost Sierra Nevada foothills occurred at 160\u00a0Ma. This timing corresponds to the J2 cusp, when paleomagnetic data suggest a sudden change in movement of the North American plate in relation to the Farallon plate that resulted in sinistral plate interaction from ca. 160 to 125\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7; Engebretson et al., 1985; Beck and Housen, 2003). This change in far-field stresses resulting from plate reorganization was interpreted to mark the initiation of orogenic gold formation in the Sierra Nevada foothills (Taylor et al., 2015) and can be similarly invoked for initial orogenic gold formation in the Klamath Mountains (Schroeder deposit, 159.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u00a0Ma).\nFormation of the 155.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.76\u00a0Ma McKinley and the 154.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma Walker deposits coincided with the onset of Nevadan orogeny in the Klamath Mountains at\u00a0~\u00a0157\u2013155\u00a0Ma and the transition from transtensional to transpressional stresses. During this time, continued widespread sinistral movement within the Sierra Nevada foothills existed as far south as the sinistrally sheared syntectonic dike swarms in the Owens Mountain area (approximately 95\u00a0km southeast of the Bagby district) that were emplaced between 155 and 148\u00a0Ma (Wolf and Saleeby, 1992), when there was sinistral oblique-slip in the Klamath Mountains (Harper, 2006). Formation of orogenic gold deposits continued during Nevadan orogeny as evidenced by the 152.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma Yankee John deposit located near the 154.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma Walker deposit, both of which are found on the hanging wall side of the Bully Choop fault.\nThe 147.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8 to 145.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0Ma\u00a0K-Ar ages obtained on hydrothermal muscovite from the Morrison-Carlock deposit in the Oro Fino district (Elder and Cashman, 1992) overlap within uncertainty of the 144.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma Quartz Hill deposit of the Scott Bar district. Elder and Cashman (1992) related the formation of the Morrison-Carlock deposit to far-field stress changes due to changes in plate motion and the end of the Nevadan orogeny.\nAt 142\u00a0Ma, North American plate velocity decreased, and absolute motion of the Farallon plate ceased, affecting their interaction at their plate boundary region. This also coincides with an eastward shift in pluton emplacement locations within the Klamath Mountains (Allen and Barnes, 2006). Mineralization at the 141.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma McKeen deposit and the 139.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0Ma Washington deposit closely coincides with this event. Sinistral movement along the terrane-bounding faults of the western cordillera of North America continued during this period (Monger et al., 1994; Umhoefer, 2003).\nAll the dated deposits in the Klamath Mountains fall within the range of initial development of these hydrothermal systems (~160\u00a0Ma) and initiation of the Early Cretaceous separation of the Klamath Mountains from the Sierra Nevada (~140\u2013135\u00a0Ma). At the lower time limit of this range, the Klamath Mountains were laterally translated westward away from the tectonically active arc (Ernst, 2013; Ernst et al., 2016). Displacement mechanisms for the Klamath Mountains are unclear due to extensive Cenozoic cover between the offset ranges, but the event must have been completed prior to deposition of Cretaceous Great Valley sedimentary rocks that lie inboard of the Klamath Mountains and outboard of the Sierra Nevada (Ernst, 2013). To account for the relative eastward displacement of the Sierra Nevada foothills and their steeply dipping terranes and bounding faults compared to the Klamath Mountains, Ernst (2013) proposed that subduction of thicker, older, and colder lithosphere underneath the Sierra Nevada foothills caused contraction while differential subduction of thinner, younger, and hotter lithosphere occurred to the north underneath the Klamath Mountains. This model is compatible with the deep-seated underthrusting that continued well into the Cretaceous in the Klamath Mountains that is indicated by detrital zircons in the interior unit of the Condrey Mountain Schist window (Coons, 2017). However, the exact causes and timing of differences in terrane and fault dips remain elusive.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe new 40Ar\/39Ar geochronological data for hydrothermal muscovite grains indicate that a 20 million-years-long window from\u00a0~\u00a0160\u2013140\u00a0Ma is the permissible range for lode gold mineralization in the Klamath Mountains. The age of 160\u00a0Ma represents that of the oldest orogenic gold deposits formed in California, both in the Klamath Mountains (this study) and the Sierra Nevada foothills (Grass Valley; Taylor et al., 2015). The youngest dated deposits in the Klamath Mountains, the\u00a0~\u00a0140\u00a0Ma McKeen and Washington deposits, formed just before initiation of the lateral translation of the Klamath Mountains away from the active arc at\u00a0~\u00a0140\u2013136\u00a0Ma. This marks the time when magmatism and gold formation were terminated in the Klamath Mountains province. Both events continued within the active arc of the Sierra Nevada after this time.\nAll but two of the deposits from this study have substantial age differences from nearby plutons or dikes. Formation ages for the McKeen and Washington deposits overlap local magmatic activity, but this reflects an elevated geothermal gradient and the effects of underthrust hydrous rocks leading to simultaneous hydrothermal fluid circulation and magmatism in a few areas before the Klamath Mountains were laterally translated westward away from the active arc. However, no genetic relationship between magmatism and formation of the lode gold deposits could be established.\nFar-field stress changes, resultant deformation and fault movement, and ages of deposits in the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Klamath Mountains gold provinces are temporally related. Initial gold-forming hydrothermal activity in both the Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada foothills occurred at 160\u00a0Ma, coincident with a major change in far-field stresses related to changes in relative motion between the Farallon and North American plates and sinistral movement of the terrane-bounding faults in western North America. Punctuated mineralization over the next 20 million years is coincident with continued sinistral fault movement and independent from specific magmatic phases. At\u00a0~\u00a0140\u00a0Ma, gold deposition in the Klamath Mountains ceased and the province was translated westward. A hiatus of gold mineralization in the Sierra Nevada foothills farther to the south also commenced at this time, but only lasted\u00a0~\u00a05\u201310 million years. Additional gold deposition occurred from 130 to 115\u00a0Ma and potentially to as young as\u00a0~\u00a0110\u00a0Ma within the Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\n","54":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nPost-mineralization preservation history of ore deposit is a fundamental process to understand the tectonic evolution of ore deposit and would be helpful to guide mineral exploration (M\u00e1rton et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2021). However, many studies only focus on ore genesis (Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018), overlooking the final stage of the evolution of ore deposit. The exhumation and preservation of deposits are closely correlated with a regional uplift and exhumation history (Wang et al., 2008). Thus, reconstructing uplift and exhumation history has been a significant way to evaluate the preservation potential of ore deposit (Yuan, 2016). Porphyry Mo deposits are the important source of global metallic molybdenum (Mao et al., 2003; Klemm et al., 2008; Chen and Wang, 2011; Wu et al., 2017). Thus, understanding the mechanisms behind the exhumation and preservation of Mo deposits is important in the evaluation and exploration of future Mo resources (Zhao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2021b). China hosts the largest Mo reserves accounting for about 54% of global supply (Cao and Shen, 2018), most of them are classified as porphyry and are widely distributed throughout Qinling-Dabie and northeast China (Mao et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2012). However, limited characterization of the uplift and exhumation history of these deposits (Chen et al., 2015) has seriously hindered the understanding to their preservation history. With the increasing depletion of shallow Mo resources in recent decades (Li and Pirajno, 2017; Yang et al., 2017b; Xue et al., 2018), it is necessary to constrain the exhumation and preservation history of these deposits, which in turn is helpful for further exploration and prediction of prospecting targets.\nApatite [Ca5(PO4)3(F,OH,Cl)], as one of common accessory minerals, is abundant in most igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, which is often utilized for dating via geo-, petro- and thermochronology (Zeitler et al., 1987; Chew et al., 2011, Yang et al., 2020a), such as Lu-Hf, U-Pb, fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)\/He with closure temperature varying from 750 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C depending on the radiogenic system applied (Cherniak et al., 1991; Ketcham et al., 1999; Farley, 2000; Larsson and S\u00f6derlund, 2005). In general, the apatite Lu-Hf (750\u2013675\u00a0\u00b0C) and U-Pb (500\u2013425\u00a0\u00b0C) dating are used to reveal thermal and tectonic history of the deeper crust and date zircon-free magmatic rocks (Blackburn et al. 2011; Chew and Spikings, 2015). The apatite fission-track (120\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) and (U-Th-Sm)\/He (80\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C) thermochronological systems are popular for studying upper crustal and near-surface process (Braun et al. 2006). At present, apatite thermochronology has been widely used to quantify the timing of exhumation during compression and extension along active tectonic margins (Thiede et al., 2013), to determine vertical fault displacement (McInnes et al., 1999; Chew and Spikings, 2015), to reveal the thermal histories of sedimentary basins (Coutand et al., 2006) and deposits (Leng et al., 2018), and to constrain the timing of mineralization-related events (Huang et al., 2019). Through integrating the apatite fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)\/He dating with associated thermal history modeling to constrain cooling history through apatite partial annealing zone (APAZ: 120\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) (Laslett et al., 1982; Donelick and Miller, 1991) and partial retention zone (PRZ: 80\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C) (Stockli et al., 2000; Wolf et al., 1998), it would be very helpful to reveal upper crustal cooling signals from \u223c5 to 2\u00a0km and the final exhumation history of ore deposit (Yuan, 2016; Gong et al., 2021). With the rapid development of accurate high-precision dating methods, in-situ apatite U-Pb and fission-track double dating on same grain have been successfully used in several cases (Glorie et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2020a). When coupled with the apatite (U-Th-Sm)\/He dating for triple-dating and thermal history modeling on same rocks, it is not only possible to rebuild continuous cooling paths (500\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C), but also accurately reveal the whole uplift and exhumation history from deeper crust to near-surface process (Carrapa et al., 2009; Jepson et al., 2018).\nThe East Qinling Orogen, one of significant Mo polymetallic metallogenic belts in China, hosts multiple world-class Mo ore clusters (e.g., Luanchuan, Jinduicheng) (Chen et al., 2009, Mao et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2010; Li and Pirajno, 2017). The Luanchuan region with Mo reserves more than 2 million tons (Mao et al., 2008, 2011) makes up the most representative Mo ore cluster in the East Qinling Orogen, and includes several porphyry-skarn Mo deposits (e.g., Nannihu, Sandaozhuang) (Bao et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2015; Chen and Santosh, 2014; Yang et al., 2019). However, previous studies mostly involved geology, source of metallogenic fluid and material, metallochronology, and metallogenic dynamic setting (Mao et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019), the post-mineralization exhumation history and preservation potential of these Mo deposits are still unclear. The Yumugou porphyry-skarn Mo-W deposit, as a newly discovered and representative medium Mo deposit in the Luanchuan ore cluster, hosts in granite, skarn and hornstone at the inner and outer contact zone of the Huangbeiling granitic intrusion which has closely genetic links with the Mo-W mineralization. Yang et al. (2020a) proposed that the Huangbeiling pluton and neighboring granitic outcrops might have high potential for future W-Mo\/Mo-W exploration in the Luanchuan ore cluster based on apatite chemical investigation. In addition, previous study focused largely on preliminary chacterization and prospecting work (TSGEI, 2009), the ore genesis and associated studies of post-mineralization of this deposit still remains poorly understood. Through constraining the uplift-exhumation and preservation history of this deposit, it is possible to quantify the exhumation-related values (e.g., rate, depth) for further guiding mineral exploration in similar mineralization systems. In general, the felsic granitoids host abundant accessory mineral of apatite, which can be utilized for thermochronology (Chew and Spikings, 2015). The ore-forming temperatures of these Mo deposits within the Luanchuan ore cluster have been determined in the range of 550\u2013115\u00a0\u00b0C (Yang et al., 2009, 2013, 2015; Xue et al., 2021b), and coupled with the closure temperatures of different (geo-) thermochronometer dating systems. Therefore, we conduct systematic apatite U-Pb (550\u2013425\u00a0\u00b0C), fission-track (120\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) and (U-Th-Sm)\/He (80\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C) triple-dating and related thermal history modeling studies on the major ore-hosting granites in the Yumugou Mo-W deposit. Our major objective is to reveal uplift and exhumation history of this deposit. Through correlation with published studies in the Luanchuan ore district, we also attempt to evaluate preservation potential of this deposit, and to provide related insights for future mineral exploration within the East Qinling Mo polymetallic metallogenic belt.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Qinling Orogen located into the central section of the Central China Orogen and distributed between the North China and Yangtze Cratons (Fig. 1\na) (Dong and Santosh, 2016; Wang et al., 2021a), and extends about 1000\u00a0km from west to east (Fig. 1b). The East Qinling Orogen in the eastern segment of this orogen is bordered to the south by the Longmenshan fault and to the north by the Sanbao fault, and consists of the northern margin of Yangtze Craton, South Qinling, North Qinling, Huaxiong block, and the southern margin of North China Craton, which are successively separated by the Mianlue, Shangdan and Luanchuan faults from south to north (Fig. 1b) (Bao et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2021). The East Qinling Orogen is also a concentrated Mo metallogenic belt in China (Chen and Santosh, 2014; Wang et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2021a, b; Li et al., 2021), and hosts numerous Mo-W-Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic deposits (Li and Pirajno, 2017; Wang et al., 2021b; Zhang et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2021b) (Fig. 1c), with the Mo reserves more than 6 million tons (Li et al., 2012a; Gao et al., 2013), which includes multiple giant deposits with the reserve more than 0.5 million tons (e.g., Donggou, Nannihu, Shangfanggou, Yuchiling) as well as tens of Mo deposits (Mo reserve\u00a0<\u00a00.5 million tons) (e.g., Lengmengou, Shibaogou, Yuku) (Fig. 1c) (Yang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). As a result, the East Qinling Orogen forms one of the most significant Mo metallogenic belt in the world (Chen et al., 2009, Mao et al., 2008). Moreover, the East Qinling Orogen also recorded the tectonic evolution of the opening and closure of Paleo-oceans during the Late Paleozoic as well as the Triassic collision\/subduction between the North China and Yangtze Cratons (Meng and Zhang, 2000; Yang et al., 2019). The known Mo deposits are largely concentrated in its northeastern terranes of Huaxiong and North Qinling within the East Qinling Orogen (Li et al., 2012a).\nThe Luanchuan Mo polymetallic ore district is situated in the northeastern East Qinling Orogen (Fig. 1b), and is one of the most representative Mo polymetallic clusters in this orogen (Fig. 2\na) (Yang et al., 2017a, b; Li et al., 2018). Mo reserves are documented as more than 2 million tons, and account for \u223c40% of the whole East Qinling Mo metallogenic belt (Mao et al., 2008, 2011). The exposed strata of this ore district mainly include Kuanping, Taowan, Luanchuan and Guandaokou Groups from bottom to top (Fig. 2a), and consist mainly of Proterozoic and Paleozoic rocks, with unconformable contact relationships among these groups in sequence (Yang et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b; Xue et al., 2021a). The widely developed structures in this ore district are represented by the major NW-trending Luanchuan fault and its numerous branches as well as a few NE-trending secondary faults (Cao et al., 2015). Several WNW-striking thrust faults, subordinate NE-striking strike-slip faults and WNW-trending interlayer fractures are also developed in this ore district, and form the major ore-controlling structures related to regional Mo-W-Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization (Fig. 2a) (Li et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2020a). The intrusions in this ore district include Mesoproterozoic alkaline granite, Neoproterozoic metagabbro dykes and syenite porphyry, and the major Jurassic-Cretaceous granite (Fig. 2a). The Jurassic-Cretaceous granite show geochemical affinities of I-type granite correlated with extensional setting, and have close genetic links to known Mo polymetallic mineralization in the Luanchuan ore district (Zhang et al., 2015, 2018; Xue et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). Two significant ore fields with a similar metallogenic system are outlined into Nannihu and Yuku ore fields in the Luanchuan region (Fig. 2a), which host the porphyry-skarn type Mo-W deposits, the skarn type Zn deposits, and the hydrothermal-vein type Pb-Zn-Ag deposits from the center of porphyry to its periphery (Fig. 2a). The Nannihu ore field comprises the proximal porphyry-skarn type Mo-W deposits of Nannihu, Sandaozhuang and Shangfanggou deposits, the intermediate skarn type Zn deposits of Luotuoshan and Yinhegou deposits, and the distal hydrothermal-vein type Pb-Zn-Ag deposits of Lengshuibeigou, Sandaogou and Hongdonggou deposits (Cao et al., 2015) (Fig. 2a). The Yuku ore field includes the Dongyuku and Dawanggou deposits (porphyry-skarn type Mo-W deposits), the Zhongyuku deposit (skarn type Zn deposits), and the Bailugou, Xigou, Yindonggou and Laoangou deposits (hydrothermal-vein type Pb-Zn-Ag deposits) (Yang et al., 2017a) (Fig. 2a).\n\n\n2.2\nDeposit geology\nThe Yumugou Mo-W deposit, located in the central segment of Luanchuan ore district, is a newly discovered medium Mo deposit and forms one important part of the Yuku ore field (Fig. 2). The exposed strata contain Mesoproterozoic Baishugou Formation (Guandaokou Group) and Neoproterozoic Sanchuan, Nannihu, Meiyaogou and Dahongkou Formations (Luanchuan Group), which consist of metasandstone, dolomite marble, schist, slate and quartzite (TSGEI, 2009) (Fig. 2b). The major structures in this deposit comprise the main NW-trending faults with strike of 290-320\u00b0 and dip in the range of 52-80\u00b0 together with a few secondary NE-trending faults (strike: 10-40\u00b0, dip: 65-85\u00b0) (Fig. 2b) (TSGEI, 2009). The intrusive rocks include Proterozoic metagabbro and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Huangbeiling porphyritic biotite monzogranite. The metagabbro is grayish to dark green colored and fine to medium grained, with a mineral assemblage of pyroxene, plagioclase and biotite, and intruded into the strata of Nannihu and Meiyaogou Formations as dikes along the NWW-trending faults in the north of this deposit, but no distinct genetic relationship with the Mo-W mineralization (TSGEI, 2009). The Huangbeiling monzogranite intrusion shows an irregular elliptical shape (Wu et al., 2015), with a length of about 4\u00a0km and a width of about 0.4\u00a0km, and is intruded into the strata of Baishugou and Sanchuan Formations (Fig. 2b). The outer margin of this pluton is characterized by relatively finer grained as well as less biotite and phenocrysts than those in the core of this pluton (TSGEI, 2009). These monzogranite rocks are pink to gray colored with porphyritic texture, and consist mainly of microcline, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts together with fine grained felsic matrix with granitic texture, which have close genetic links with Mo-W mineralization (Zhao, 2018; Guo et al., 2018). The widely developed contact metasomatism along the outer zone of the Huangbeiling intrusion results in calcium skarnization within the contact zone and nearby strata of Sanchuan Formation, and forms numerous skarns of garnet and garnet calcium ferrite (Fig. 3). The alteration of wall rocks mainly contains K-feldspathization, silicification, carbonate-zeolite and epidotization (TSGEI, 2009).\nThe Yumugou Mo-W deposit has inferred and predicted metal reserves of 60,590 tons Mo with an average grade of 0.06%, and 62,900 tons WO3 with an average grade of 0.14% (TSGEI, 2009). Two orebodies are delineated in this deposit, with one major orebody distributed around the inner and outer contact zone of the Huangbeiling granitic intrusion as well as another minor orebody hosted into the strata of Sanchuan Formation in the south of this ore district (Fig. 3) (TSGEI, 2009). The major orebody shows an irregular ellipsoid shape and occurs as stratiform-like, with a length of 1300\u00a0m from east to west and a width of 640\u00a0m from north to south, covering an area of 0.85 square kilometers (TSGEI, 2009). The ore rocks are mainly hosted in the skarn, hornstone, metamorphic sandstone and granite porphyry together with a few in the metagabbro, marble and dolomite (TSGEI, 2009). The minor orebody also displays irregular stratiform-like occurrence, consistent with the occurrence of strata. The ore-hosting rocks consist mainly of skarn and hornstone, which were formed by the contact metasomatism with carbonatite of the Sanchuan Formation (TSGEI, 2009). The Mo ore rocks could be further divided into four types of felsic hornstone, diopside plagioclase hornstone, skarn and granite as well as some types of metagabbro, metasandstone and dolomite marble (Fig. 3). The ore mineral of these rocks mainly comprises disseminated and vein molybdenite, scheelite, sphalerite, galena and pyrite (TSGEI, 2009). The mineralization stages of this deposit are divided into these stages of skarn, K-feldspar quartz sulfide, quartz sulfide and zeolite carbonate sulfide, the dominant phase is the quartz sulfide stage represented by (quartz) veins of molybdenite and pyrite hosting in various ore-hosting rocks (TSGEI, 2009).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and methods\n\n3.1\nSampling and petrography\nRepresentative samples collected from the surface exposures, adit quarry and boreholes of Huangbeiling intrusion in the Yumugou Mo-W deposit (Figs. 2, 4) were used for petrographic, in-situ apatite U-Pb and fission-track double dating, apatite (U-Th-Sm)\/He dating, and associated thermal history modeling studies. Sample 17HBL-10\u20131 (N: 33\u00b053\u203204.74\u2033; E: 111\u00b028\u203256.42\u2033; H: 1446\u00a0m) was collected from a rock exposure at the top of Huangbeiling Mountain (Fig. 2b), and is off-white colored and fine grained monzogranite, with granitic texture and massive structure (Fig. 5\na). Sample 19LC-3\u201310 was taken from borehole ZK1705 at a depth of \u223c357\u00a0m (Fig. 4), whereas sample 19LC-7\u20132 was sampled from borehole ZK1707 at a depth of \u223c248\u00a0m (Fig. 4). Both samples are pink colored monzogranites, and show granular texture with a mineral assemblage of K-feldspar, plagioclase, quartz and biotite (Fig. 5c, e). Sample 20HBL-1\u20135 monzogranite (N: 33\u00b053\u203242.48\u2033; E: 111\u00b028\u203216.28\u2033; H: 1117\u00a0m) is gray colored and medium grained, and consists mainly of felsic minerals and minor biotite, with several disseminated pyrites hosting in these minerals (Fig. 5g), which was taken from the adit quarry at the base of Huangbeiling Mountain (Fig. 2b).\nPetrographic studies were performed on polished thin sections under one microscope at the School of Earth Sciences, Lanzhou University. Under thin sections (Fig. 5b, d, f, h), these studied samples all show typical granitic texture, and consist mainly of K-feldspar (30\u201345%), plagioclase (30\u201345%), quartz (20\u201330%) and biotite (1\u20135%). K-feldspar is medium grained (0.3\u20131.2\u00a0mm) and shows subhedral to anhedral granular texture and carlsbad twinning. Some K-feldspars intergrew with plagioclase, and host lots of biotite inclusions (Fig. 5d). Plagioclase is fine to medium grained (0.1\u20130.8\u00a0mm) and subhedral texture, characterized by polysynthetic twinning. Quartz is gray colored and mostly medium grained (0.4\u20131.5\u00a0mm), and displays subhedral to anhedral granular texture and wavy extinction. Biotite is yellow to brown colored with strong pleochroism and anhedral texture, and occurs as two forms with one seen as inclusions in plagioclases and K-feldspars (Fig. 5d, h) and another one hosted in the gaps among felsic minerals (Fig. 5d, f). Pyrite as the major metallic mineral is fine grained, and displays anhedral texture and is hosted in gaps among felsic minerals (Fig. 5d, h).\n\n\n3.2\nAnalytical methods\nApatite grains were separated through using standard mineral separation procedures at the Yu'neng Geological and Mineral Separation Survey Centre, Langfang, China, then picked and mounted in epoxy resin on a slide, finally via polishing to expose their interiors. The mounted apatite was etched by 5.5\u00a0mol\/L HNO3 solution at 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0s to reveal their spontaneous fission tracks (Donelick et al. 2005). Fission track counting, track length and Dpar values were measured under an Olympus microscope at the University of Arizona, USA.\nApatite U-Pb (AUPb) and fission-track (AFT) double dating analyses (samples 19LC-3\u201310, 19LC-7\u20132, 20HBL-1\u20135) were concurrently performed on same grains through using a Photon Machine Analyte G2 Excimer 193\u00a0nm laser ablation system connected to a Thermo Element2 single collector High Resolution ICP-MS at the Arizona LaserChron Center, University of Arizona, USA. Spot size of ablations were set as 30\u00a0\u03bcm with a 5\u00a0Hz laser repetition rate, the reference materials include Madagascar (474.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma; Thomson et al., 2012), Mt. McClure (523.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0Ma; Schoene and Bowring, 2006) and Durango apatite (31.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0Ma; McDowell et al., 2005), the detailed analytical procedure is documented in Jepson et al. (2021). The AFT dating of sample 17HBL-10\u20131 was conducted within the Adelaide Microscopy, University of Adelaide, Australia, following the analytical method noted by Glorie et al. (2017). Data reduction was performed through the Iolite software (Paton et al. 2011; Chew et al. 2014), IsoplotR software (Vermeesch, 2018) was used to generate AUPb Tera-Wasserburg plots and ages, and RadialPlotter software (Vermeesch, 2009) was selected for calculating AFT central ages.\nApatite (U-Th-Sm)\/He (AHe) dating were conducted using dissolution and isotope dilution of sample aliquots by ICP-MS at the Arizona Radiogenic Helium Dating Laboratory (ARHDL), University of Arizona, USA. Apatite grains were measured under a Leica MZ16 stereozoom microscopes, and then selected these grains characterized by euhedral texture, grain width above 60\u00a0\u03bcm and no inclusions and fractures to continue AHe dating analysis. Durango apatite (31.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0Ma; McDowell et al., 2005) was used as an analytical standard, AHe ages were calculated based on the procedure noted by Gautheron et al. (2009), following the detailed analytical procedure described in the Reiners (2005) and Reiners and Nicolescu (2006).\nThermal history modeling was established by inputting the newly obtained AFT and AHe ages, confined fission track length data and some geological constraints into QTQt software (Gallagher, 2012) to explore possible cooling paths. Kinetic parameters of the annealing model (Ketcham et al., 2007), Dpar (Burtner et al., 1994), radiation damage accumulation and annealing model of the Flowers et al. (2009), initial temperature constraints (400\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C) of AUPb age, and the present temperature of 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0\u00b0C were jointly used to constrain thermal history. The maximum likelihood, maximum posterior, maximum mode and expected models were outputted from the QTQt software, but only the expected model was used for each sample, following the detailed modeling procedure outlined by Glorie et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nApatite U-Pb dating\nApatite U-Pb dates were obtained from samples 19LC-3\u201310, 19LC-7\u20132 and 20HBL-1\u20135, the AUPb dating results are given in Supplementary Table 1.\nThirty apatite grains from sample 19LC-3\u201310 yielded a Tera-Wasserburg linear array, with the lower intercept age at 141.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.1\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.6) and 207Pb corrected weighted mean 206Pb-238U ages in the range of 149.9\u2013136.0\u00a0Ma (Fig. 6\na). Thirty apatite grains from sample 19LC-7\u20132 also show one Tera-Wasserburg linear array (Fig. 6b), and yielded a lower intercept age at 153.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.7) and 207Pb corrected weighted mean 206Pb-238U ages ranging from 158.9 to 147.8\u00a0Ma. Thirty apatite grains from sample 20HBL-1\u20135 yielded a Tera-Wasserburg linear array, and gave a lower intercept age at 142.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a01.0) (Fig. 6c), with 207Pb corrected weighted mean 206Pb-238U ages between 148.7 and 135.6\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n4.2\nApatite fission track dating\nApatite fission track analysis was conducted on the samples 17HBL-10\u20131, 19LC-3\u201310, 19LC-7\u20132 and 20HBL-1\u20135, the obtained AFT dating results are presented in Supplementary Table 2.\nSample 17HBL-10\u20131 taken from surface exposures yielded the youngest AFT central age of 58.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7\na), with the P(\u03c72) value of 7%, Dpar ranging from 0.9 to 1.6\u00a0\u03bcm and mean track length (MTL) of 12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 7e). Sample 19LC-3\u201310 collected from borehole ZK1705 at a depth of \u223c357\u00a0m yielded the oldest AFT central age of 114.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7b) and MTL of 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 7f), with the P(\u03c72) value of 61% and Dpar in the range of 1.4\u20132.7\u00a0\u03bcm. Sample 19LC-7\u20132 taken from borehole ZK1707 at a depth of \u223c248\u00a0m yielded a moderate AFT central age of 87.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0Ma and Dpar varying from 1.5 to 3.0\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 7c) without MTL, the results also show P(\u03c72) value of 0% lower than 5% and not pass the \u03c72 test. Sample 20HBL-1\u20135 sampled from Huangbeiling adit yielded a relatively older AFT central age of 104.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0Ma, MTL of 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig. 7g) and Dpar ranging of 1.7\u20133.2\u00a0\u03bcm, with the P(\u03c72) value of 55% (Fig. 7d).\n\n\n4.3\nApatite (U-Th-Sm)\/He dating\nApatite (U-Th-Sm)\/He dating was performed on the samples 19LC-3\u201310 and 20HBL-1\u20135, the obtained AHe data are shown in Supplementary Table 3.\nThree apatite grains from sample 19LC-3\u201310 yielded single grain AHe ages in the range of 1296.1\u201393.5\u00a0Ma. Among these, two apatite grains show distinctly abnormal AHe ages of 1296.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.3 and 228.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0Ma with spherical equivalent radii (Rs) of 100.8\u2013116.4\u00a0\u03bcm and effective uranium (eU) values varying from 29.4 to 30.5\u00a0ppm, which are much older than AUPb and AFT ages of the sample 19LC-3\u201310, likely resulting from lots of He-rich inclusions and fractures inside, and thus would be ruled out when modeling, and further interpretation of these AHe data also not be continued. One apatite yielded single grain AHe ages of 93.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma, Rs of 79.0\u00a0\u03bcm, and eU value of 40.1\u00a0ppm, and is younger than corresponding AFT and AUPb ages, which could be used to model thermal history. Sample 20HBL-1\u20135 gave three single grain AHe ages of 81.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0, 77.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 and 66.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma, respectively, with Rs of 66.4\u201399.7\u00a0\u03bcm and eU values of 26.3\u201333.4\u00a0ppm, which are mostly younger than corresponding AUPb and AFT ages of the sample 20HBL-1-5.\n\n\n4.4\nThermal history modeling\nSample 17HBL-10\u20131 yielded 128 confined fission tracks (Fig. 7e), and the modeling results without AHe age data constraints show rapid cooling through the APAZ between 75 and 50\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8\na, b). Thermal history model from sample 19LC-3\u201310 is constrained by 83 confined fission tracks (Fig. 7f) and AHe age data, the results display relatively rapid cooling through the APAZ and PRZ at ca. 125\u2013110\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8c, d). Sample 20HBL-1\u20135 gave 76 confined fission tracks (Fig. 7g), and the thermal history model with AHe age data constraints indicates two cooling stages, with one relatively rapid cooling stage through the APAZ at ca. 112\u2013100\u00a0Ma and one slow cooling stage through the PRZ between 100 and 60\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8e, f). In addition, the measured MTL data are almost consistent with corresponding predicted data (Fig. 8b, d, f).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTemporal evolution of the Yumugou deposit\nSingle-grain isochron corrected AUPb age data in this study show wide variation ranging between 166 and 112\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9\nb), with lower intercept ages in the range of 153.1\u2013141.1\u00a0Ma (Fig. 6) and one age peak at ca. 143\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9b). These newly obtained AUPb ages are interpreted to represent the crystallization age of apatite, and are consistent with corresponding zircon U-Pb (ZUPb) ages of the Huangbeiling pluton (Qian et al., 2021) with ZUPb ages varying from 156.7 to 132.2\u00a0Ma and an age peak at ca. 143\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9a). Therefore, we interpret AUPb dates to reflect post-plutonic crystallization cooling (Kirkland et al. 2018). Previously published AUPb age data of other Late Mesozoic Luanchuan plutons also show wide variation in the range of 151.5\u2013102.3\u00a0Ma with a major peak at ca. 141\u00a0Ma, and corresponding ZUPb ages vary from 176.3 to 108.0\u00a0Ma with a major peak at ca. 147\u00a0Ma (Yang et al., 2020a). Except for the Laojunshan batholith in the south of Luanchuan fault (Fig. 2a) which yielded Middle Cretaceous ZUPb and AUPb ages (Yang et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2020a, Yang et al., 2020b), the ZUPb and AUPb ages of other Luanchuan plutons overlap with the newly obtained AUPb ages of the Huangbeiling pluton within errors, further confirming rapid post-magmatic cooling below \u223c450\u00a0\u00b0C in response to shallow emplacement in the Luanchuan ore district (Yang et al., 2020a). Moreover, the ZUPb and AUPb ages of Huangbeiling pluton also record the first magmatic pulse (160\u2013130\u00a0Ma) in the Luanchuan region, corresponding to the major regional magmatic pulses at ca. 160\u2013125\u00a0Ma in the Qinling Orogen, which have been correlated with continuous northward subduction of the Yangtze Craton beneath the North China Craton under a compression tectonic setting during pre-125\u00a0Ma (Li et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019).\nPrevious studies have compiled metallogenetic ages (e.g., molybdenite Re-Os, sphalerite Rb-Sr, quartz Ar-Ar dating) of the Luanchuan hydrothermal-vein Pb-Zn-Ag and porphyry-skarn Mo-W deposits (Xue et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019, 2020a), the results show ore-forming ages in the range of 147.5\u2013135.7\u00a0Ma with a major peak at ca. 145\u00a0Ma (Yang et al., 2020a). Five molybdenite samples from the Yumugou porphyry-skarn Mo-W deposit yielded Re-Os model ages in a range of 146.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 to 147.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0Ma (unpublished), indicating that the Yumugou deposit also formed at ca. 145\u00a0Ma. Thus, we propose that the ZUPb and AUPb ages of the ore-hosting Huangbeiling pluton recorded coeval metallogenetic event, and have close temporal links with the Yumugou Mo-W mineralization during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. Further, we suggest that the AFT central ages of 114.1\u201358.2\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7) and associated AHe ages (93.5\u201366.2\u00a0Ma) (Fig. 9d) constrain the timing of post-mineralization cooling to the upper crust. All age data analyzed from this study shows age peak at ca. 96.0\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9c) for AFT and ca. 80.0\u00a0Ma for AHe ages (Fig. 9d), substantially younger than corresponding ZUPb and AUPb ages on the same samples of the Huangbeiling pluton. Specifically, the AUPb age peak (\u223c143\u00a0Ma) is same with the ZUPb age peak (\u223c143\u00a0Ma), the AFT age peak (\u223c96\u00a0Ma) is ca. 50\u00a0Ma younger than the AUPb age peak (\u223c143\u00a0Ma), whereas the AHe age peak (\u223c80\u00a0Ma) is ca. 15\u00a0Ma younger than the AFT age peak (\u223c96\u00a0Ma) (Fig. 9). Coupled with the closure temperatures of ZUPb (greater than 900\u00a0\u00b0C), AUPb (500\u2013425\u00a0\u00b0C), AFT (120\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C) and AHe (80\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C) dating techniques, these age peaks suggest that the Yumugou Mo-W deposit underwent rapid host-rock thermal equilibration below \u223c450\u00a0\u00b0C after magma emplacement in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, with concomitant the formation of this deposit, followed by slow cooling below \u223c60\u00a0\u00b0C at ca. 143\u201396\u00a0Ma, and relatively rapid cooling below \u223c40\u00a0\u00b0C at ca. 96\u201380\u00a0Ma (Fig. 9).\n\n\n5.2\nUplift-exhumation history of the Yumugou deposit\nThermal history models constructed in this study collectively suggest two stages of rapid cooling, with the first stage during the Early Cretaceous at ca. 125\u2013100\u00a0Ma and the second stage in the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene (73\u201350\u00a0Ma) (Fig. 10\na). These periods of rapid exhumation were interrupted by a period of slow cooling during the Late Cretaceous (100\u201373\u00a0Ma) in the PRZ (Fig. 10a). Moreover, thermal history model of the sample 17HBL-10\u20131 also shows a rapid cooling through the PRZ during the Neogene prior to cooling to the surface. However, as this model lacks AHe age data to precisely constrain, and thus the Neogene cooling event would not be further discussed in this study (Fig. 10a).\nEarly Cretaceous rapid cooling (125\u2013100\u00a0Ma): Previous several studies proposed that the Luanchuan region was under compression during 160\u2013130\u00a0Ma (Li et al., 2012a; Yang et al., 2019). The northward subduction of the Yangtze Craton beneath the North China Craton continued until \u223c125\u00a0Ma with concomitant crustal thickening and subducted slab break-off, rollback, or delamination (Li et al., 2018) and\/or the southward intra-continental subduction of the North China Craton in response to syn-collisional tectonic setting during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Dong et al., 2011, 2016; Yang et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2021). Following the tectonic setting was transformed from compression to extension at ca. 125\u00a0Ma (Xue et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). This extension tectonics is correlated with the N-S trending post-collisional extension between the North China and Yangtze Cratons and the E-W trending back-arc extension induced by the Paleo-Pacific Plate subduction from the east during the Early Cretaceous (Yang et al., 2019), resulting in asthenospheric upwelling, mafic magma underplating, and crustal melting (Li et al., 2018). Moreover, the Luanchuan granitoids underwent magma emplacement and post-magmatic rapid cooling at ca. 160\u2013130\u00a0Ma revealed by previously published ZUPb and AUPb ages in response to shallow emplacement (Yang et al., 2019, 2020a), and rapid cooling to the shallow surface, which likely caused related exhumation at ca. 125\u2013100\u00a0Ma. Thus, we interpret the Early Cretaceous rapid cooling as a response to tectonic extension derived by the westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate, accompanied by with asthenospheric upwelling and lithospheric thinning, which possibly result in the rapid cooling of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous magmatism in the Luanchuan ore district.\nLate Cretaceous slow cooling (100\u201373\u00a0Ma): During the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene, the Paleo-Pacific Plate (Izanagi\/Kula) underwent a period of crustal deformation and basin evolution in East Asia (Cho et al., 2016). The Izanagi Plate underwent rapid N- or NW-directed oblique subduction beneath the Eurasian Plate at ca. 135\u201385\u00a0Ma or until ca. 60\u00a0Ma (Maruyama et al., 1997), Subsequently, the Kula Plate underwent west-northwestward orthogonal subduction at ca. 85\u201364\u00a0Ma (Engebretson et al., 1985). The Late Cretaceous slow cooling identified in this study corresponds temporally to the response with the tectonic evolution of the East Asia during the Late Cretaceous. Given the distal nature of the study area (about \u223c1000\u00a0km) from the margin of eastern Asia, we correlate the Late Cretaceous slow cooling pulse of the Luanchuan region with the far-field effect of the Paleo-Pacific Plate (Izanagi\/Kula) (De Grave and Buslov, 2007). Furthermore, this period of slow cooling also corresponds to the timing of rifting and exhumation history of Bohai Bay and adjacent basins in the East Asia (Yang et al., 2020b).\nLate Cretaceous to Paleogene rapid cooling (73\u201350\u00a0Ma): Previous studies suggested that the East Asia encountered lateral extrusion toward the east triggered by the far-field effect of the India-Eurasia collision during the Paleogene (Tapponnier and Molar, 1997; Grimmer et al., 2002), the initial India-Eurasia collision is also widely accepted to have started during the Paleogene (Patriat and Achache, 1984; Jin et al., 2018). In addition, the largest continental-scale NNE-striking fault zone of Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ) in the eastern China (Xu and Zhu, 1994), located in the northeast of the Luanchuan region, underwent continued sinistral strike-slip motion induced by the NNW-directed Pacific subduction during 65\u201355\u00a0Ma, and ended at ca. 55\u00a0Ma derived by the far-field effect of the NNE-directed India-Eurasia collision (Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b). The Pacific Plate was subsequently changed from NNW to WNW in the subduction direction, which modified the stress balance on the TLFZ, resulting in dextral motion of the TLFZ at ca. 48\u201342\u00a0Ma (Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b). The Pacific Plate was also orthogonally subducted west-northwestward at ca. 64\u201353\u00a0Ma, afterwards obliquely subducted northward beneath the eastern Asia at ca. 53\u201348\u00a0Ma (Engebretson et al., 1985). The ca. 73\u201350\u00a0Ma rapid cooling pulse revealed in the sample 17HBL-10\u20131 (Fig. 10a) is also constrained by its AFT central age of \u223c58.2\u00a0Ma and relatively short MTL value (Fig. 7e). Thus, we propose that the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene rapid cooling possibly response to the major far-field effects from the eastern Pacific Plate subduction and the northeastern sinistral strike-slip motion of TLFZ at ca. 65\u201355\u00a0Ma, as well as possible minor expansion effects of the Tibetan plateau induced by the Paleogene India-Eurasia collision from the southwest.\n\n\n5.3\nPreservation and exploration of the Yumugou deposit\nExhumation rate and depth of ore deposits are usually calculated through low-temperature thermochronological data, the frequently-used means mainly include age-closure, age-elevation, mineral-pair and thermal history modeling methods (Ding et al., 2007). Considering these constraints of short horizontal distance and large vertical distance of sampling demand for age-elevation method and uniformly uplift to the surface for age-closure method, and coupled with spatial location of sampling in this study and the muti-method apatite U-Pb, fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)\/He triple-dating techniques on same rocks, we adopt the mineral-pair and thermal history modeling methods to calculate exhumation rate and depth in this study. A geothermal gradient of 35\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Li et al., 2011) and the closure temperatures of ZUPb (950\u00a0\u00b0C), molybdenite Re-Os (525\u00a0\u00b0C), AUPb (400\u00a0\u00b0C), AFT (90\u00a0\u00b0C) and AHe (60\u00a0\u00b0C) were adopted in this study. Additionally, the metallogenic depth of the Yumugou Mo-W deposit was roughly estimated through fluid inclusion data of Mo polymetallic deposits from previous studies in the Luanchuan ore district (Yang et al., 2009, 2013; Xue et al., 2021b), the equations related to exhumation were based on: 1) Cooling rate = (T2 - T1)\/(t2 - t1), 2) Exhumation rate\u00a0=\u00a0Cooling rate\/geothermal gradient, and 3)Exhumation depth\u00a0=\u00a0Exhumation rate \u00d7 (t2 - t1) (noted that: T is the closure temperature, while t represents the age) (Ding et al., 2007; Li et al., 2019).\nExhumation rate and depth of the Yumuogu deposit were calculated via multiple geochronometers in this study (Fig. 10b) (McInnes et al., 2005), the results show a very rapid cooling rate of 850.0\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, an exhumation rate of 24.29\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 12.1\u00a0km during the closure temperature from ZUPb to molybdenite Re-Os (MoRO) dating systems, followed by a moderate cooling rate of 208.3\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, an exhumation rate of 5.95\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 3.6\u00a0km from MoRO to AUPb closure temperature. Given that the Yumugou M\u2212Wo deposit was determined to form at ca. 145\u00a0Ma, these ages of ZUPb, MoRO and AUPb of the Huangbeiling pluton are almost equal within error, we thus argue that the Huangbeiling pluton has had at least 15\u00a0km depth denuded during pre-145\u00a0Ma. Subsequently, the Yumugou deposit underwent a slow cooling rate of 5.7\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, an exhumation rate of 0.16\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 8.9\u00a0km during the AUPb to AFT closure temperature, eventually with a relatively slower cooling rate of 2.6\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, an exhumation rate of 0.08\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 0.9\u00a0km from AFT to AHe closure temperature. Accordingly, we conclude that the Yumugou deposit following crystallization has had at least 9.8\u00a0km of material removed above it. However, previous fluid inclusion studies in the Luanchuan ore district have estimated the metallogenic depth of Mo deposits in the range of 3\u20137\u00a0km (Yang et al., 2009, 2013; Xue et al., 2021b). The calculated exhumation depth (\u223c9.8\u00a0km) of the Yumugou Mo-W deposit does not correlate with the determined metallogenic depth (3\u20137\u00a0km) of the Luanchuan Mo deposits, but it possibly suggests that metallogenic depth was perhaps closer to 7\u00a0km, rather than to 3\u00a0km. Thus, we propose that this rough algorithm based on multiple geochronometers could not precisely evaluate the exhumation degree of study object, but it can be used as related constraints to accurately restrain the thermal history paths during modeling.\nThermal history models of the Yumugou deposit in this study (Figs. 8,\u00a010a) were constrained by AFT and AHe ages, confined fission track length data and some other geological constraints, and thus these models are relatively reliable and can accurately reveal the exhumation history of this deposit. The modeling results suggest a rapid cooling rates in the range of 7.3\u20135.5\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma (mean value: 6.4\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma), an average exhumation rate of 0.18\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 3.6\u00a0km in the first rapid cooling stage (125\u2013100\u00a0Ma), followed by a slow cooling rate of 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, an exhumation rate of 0.01\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 0.3\u00a0km at ca. 100\u201373\u00a0Ma, and afterwards underwent another phase of rapid cooling (73\u201350\u00a0Ma) with a relatively fast cooling rate of 2.6\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, an exhumation rate of 0.08\u00a0km\/Ma and an exhumation depth of 1.7\u00a0km (Fig. 10a). Thus, we could conclude that the Yumugou deposit has been exhumed at least 5.6\u00a0km after ca. 145\u00a0Ma. In comparison with previously determined metallogenic depth (3\u20137\u00a0km), we theoretically deduce that there will be possible more than 1\u00a0km metallogenic depth preserved in the Yumugou Mo-W deposit. In addition, most of exploratory boreholes within the Yumugou Mo-W deposit show shallow prospecting depths at 200\u2013500\u00a0m (Fig. 3), thus suggesting good potential for mineral exploration. By comparison with other giant Mo deposits in the East Qinling Mo polymetallic metallogenic belt (e.g., Jinduicheng, Yuchiling, Donggou) (Zhu et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2008, 2011; Li et al., 2012b; Yang et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2015), it can be seen that similar metallogenic setting and features of Mo deposits are hosted in this orogen. Thus, we further infer that these Mo deposits in the East Qinling Orogen likely have underwent a similar degree of exhumation after formation and show good potential for prospecting exploration.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe Yumugou Mo-W deposit yielded AUPb ages in the range of 166\u2013112\u00a0Ma, almost consistent with the formation of this deposit, and also gave AFT central ages varying from 114.1 to 58.2\u00a0Ma and AHe dates between 93.5 and 66.2\u00a0Ma, representing the post-mineralization cooling ages.\n\n\n(2)\nThree cooling stages are revealed in this study, with the rapid cooling in the 125\u2013100\u00a0Ma, slow cooling at ca. 100\u201373\u00a0Ma, and another rapid cooling in the 73\u201350\u00a0Ma, which are correlated with the tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Pacific and Pacific Plates subduction beneath the eastern Asia in the Meso-Cenozoic and the TLFZ motion during the Paleogene, as well as possible minor far-field effects from the Paleogene India-Eurasia collision.\n\n\n(3)\nMore than 1\u00a0km metallogenic depth is theoretically preserved in the Yumugou Mo-W deposit. When combined with similar metallogenic setting and features of other Mo deposits in the East Qinling Orogen, a similar exhumation degree of Mo deposits and good potential for mineral exploration are inferred in this orogen.\n\n\n\n\n","55":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nCurrent production and reserves of base metals will soon be insufficient to meet increasing demands (e.g., Mudd et al., 2017). Sediment-hosted base metal deposits (sedimentary-exhalative (SEDEX) or Clastic dominated (CD), Mississippi Valley Type (MVT), and Irish-type) are important sources for these metals with SEDEX and MVT accounting for 32% and 6% of global production, respectively (Leach et al., 2005; Leach et al., 2010; Wilkinson et al., 2005; Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007). As supplies decrease, it is important to expand current resources and reserves, utilize novel exploration techniques and strategies, and exploit alternative deposit types.\nThe Morro Agudo Pb-Zn mine is located in the Vazante-Paracatu Mineral Belt of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which currently accounts for the majority of zinc production in Brazil (Olivo et al., 2018). These districts are hosted by Proterozoic carbonate-dominated strata and contain sulfide-Zn (e.g., Morro Agudo, Fagundes, Ambr\u00f3sia, Bonsucesso) (Misi et al., 2005; Monteiro et al., 2006; Cordeiro et al., 2018) as well as world-class hypogene and supergene silicate-Zn deposits (e.g., Vazante and North Extension mines) and various occurrences (Figs. 1-3\n\n\n) (Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Slezak et al., 2014; Olivo et al., 2018). The silicate-zinc deposits are located in the south of the belt, whereas most of the sulfide-zinc deposits are in the northern part (Fig.\u00a01C). The Morro Agudo District, which is located in the central portion of this metallogenetic belt, comprises the Morro Agudo deposit and several occurrences, including Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, and Morro do Cap\u00e3o.\nThe silicate-Zn deposits and Ambr\u00f3sia and Fagundes sulfide deposits have been the focus of numerous studies (e.g., Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Slezak et al., 2014; Carvalho et al., 2017; McGladrey et al., 2017; Olivo et al., 2018), and there is little debate regarding the proposed processes related to mineralization. However, the genesis of the Morro Agudo mine is controversial, and researchers have proposed multiple genetic models, such as SEDEX vs. MVT, to explain the stratabound and structurally controlled nature of mineralization (SEDEX: Misi et al., 1999; Irish-type: Dardenne and Freitas-Silva, 1999; Dardenne, 2000; Cunha et al., 2007; MVT: Iyer et al., 1992; Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Cordeiro et al., 2018). This is due in part to uncertainty in the age of mineralization based on Pb dating of galena (650\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0Ma: Iyer et al., 1992; and 1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga: Freitas-Silva and Dardenne, 1997) and distinct geometry and textural features in the various orebodies from the Morro Agudo deposit (e.g., Dardenne and Freitas-Silva, 1999; Cordeiro et al., 2018). However, whole-rock geochemical signature, mineralogical, including mineral chemistry, and textural relationships were not consistently integrated with the isotopic studies. Moreover, little is known about the other Zn-Pb sulfide occurrences proximal to the Morro Agudo deposit, which could assist in elucidating the evolution of the mineralizing system.\nIn this paper, we present the lithostratigraphic controls, mineralogical compositions, textural relationships, and lithogeochemical signature of mineralization in the Morro Agudo orebodies and Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences of the Morro Agudo district (Fig. 3) to further our understanding of the processes involved in the formation of the distinct styles of mineralization in this district. These are one of the few examples of Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic dolostone-hosted deposits with characteristics similar to Mississippi Valley-type deposits (Leach et al., 2005), as most of the other examples have been metamorphosed to high grade conditions (e.g., Grenville-hosted deposits: Matt et al., 2019). Therefore, the results of this study can be relevant for base metal exploration in other Proterozoic basins.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Vazante-Paracatu mining district occurs in the southern part of the north-trending Bras\u00edlia Fold Belt (BFB), which extends for 1200\u00a0km parallel to the western margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (SFC) (Fig.\u00a01A and B) (Monteiro et al., 2007; Valeriano, 2017; Olivo et al., 2018). The southern part is a ca. 800\u00a0km-long SE-trending belt whereas the northern segment is NE-trending and ca. 400\u00a0km-long (Fonseca et al., 1995; Valeriano, 2017).\nThe BFB formed through a complex series of tectonic events initiated with the failed continental rifting of the S\u00e3o Francisco-Congo paleocontinent (ca. 1.7\u00a0Ga) (Martins-Neto, 2009) and ended with Neoproterozoic convergence of the SFC with the Amazonian Craton and the Paran\u00e1 Basin (Dardenne, 2000; Misi et al., 2005). The initiation of the Brasiliano Orogeny began in 850\u2013750\u00a0Ma with the convergence of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic Goi\u00e1s Massif and Neoproterozoic Goi\u00e1s magmatic arc with the western margin of the SFC (Pimentel et al., 1991). Between 650 and 550\u00a0Ma the BFB was thrust eastward onto the SFC (Misi et al., 2014; Valeriano, 2017).\nThe Meso- to Neoproterozoic Canastra, Ibi\u00e1, Vazante, and Bambu\u00ed groups are the sedimentary units that predominate in the southern part of the BFB (Fig.\u00a01B). The Canastra, Ibi\u00e1, and Vazante groups were thrusted in a nappe system over the eastern Bambu\u00ed Group during the Brasiliano orogeny (Dardenne, 2000). The Canastra Group hosts the world-class Morro do Ouro orogenic gold deposit (Oliver et al., 2015). The Vazante Group (Fig. 2) hosts sulfide- and silicate-zinc deposits and occurrences (Olivo et al., 2018), which are the focus of this study. Phosphate deposits and other minor zinc and lead occurrences are also present throughout the Vazante Group, as well as in the Bambu\u00ed Group (Dardenne et al., 1997).\n\n2.1\nVazante group stratigraphy\nThe Vazante Group is a predominantly dolomitic carbonate succession that is intercalated with siliciclastic and pelitic rocks. It extends in a N-trending arcuate belt, which is 250\u00a0km-long and 25\u201330\u00a0km-wide (Fig.\u00a01C) (Dardenne, 2000). The age and tectonic setting at the time of deposition of the Vazante Group and its relationship with the Bambu\u00ed Group are ambiguous (Dardenne, 2000; Rodrigues et al., 2012; Slezak et al., 2014; Sotero et al., 2021). Rodrigues et al. (2012) proposed that the Vazante Group was deposited during the Neoproterozoic. Others, such as Martins-Neto (2009) and Valeriano et al. (2008), interpreted Vazante deposition to be in a passive-margin setting on the S\u00e3o Francisco paleocontinent during the Mesoproterozoic. However, based on new geochemical and geochronological data from the siliciclastic units of the Vazante Group, Fernandes et al. (2019b) proposed that these rocks were derived from Paleoproterozoic andesitic to felsic continental rocks and deposited between 1.1 and 1.3\u00a0Ga in a rift environment rather than in a passive continental margin.\n\nDardenne (2000) established the lithostratigraphy of the Vazante Group, which is composed of seven formations, from base to top (Fig. 2): Retiro-Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito, Rocinha, Lagamar, Serra do Garrote, Serra do Po\u00e7o Verde, Morro do Calc\u00e1rio, and Lapa. However, based on detrital zircon U-Pb dating, the Retiro-Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Bonito and Rocinha formations are reinterpreted as Neoproterozoic, and the Lagamar to Lapa formations as Mesoproterozoic (Rodrigues et al., 2012; Misi et al., 2014). Misi et al. (2014) reported a tectonic contact between the Lagamar and Rocinha formations, showing that the Mesoproterozoic formations have been thrust over the Neoproterozoic formations (Fig. 2). The Serra do Po\u00e7o Verde and Morro do Calc\u00e1rio formations are the main hosts of silicate- and sulfide-zinc mineralization, respectively.\nMorro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation is mainly composed of oolitic and peloidal dolarenites (Monteiro et al., 2007), stromatolitic bioherms and biostrome facies typical of a shallow subtidal environment (Dardenne, 2000). The dolomites exhibit varying degrees of brecciation. Thin layers of phyllite and siltstone units are interbedded with dolomitic rocks (Dardenne, 2000). The Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation yielded Sm-Nd TDM ages of 2.11\u20132.18\u00a0Ga and detrital zircon U-Pb with a youngest concordant age of 1137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0Ma (Rodrigues et al., 2012), consistent with a Paleoproterozoic source of detritus and Mesoproterozoic age of deposition, as proposed by Fernandes et al. (2019b).\n\n\n2.2\nVazante group base metal sulfide mineralization\nSulfide Zn-Pb Ambr\u00f3sia deposit, and Fagundes and Bonsucesso prospects are located north of the Morro Agudo district (Fig.\u00a01B) and are also hosted in the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation (Fig. 2) (Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Cunha et al., 2007). Nexa Resources is conducting feasibility studies at the Bonsucesso and Fagundes occurrences, and there are no public ore resource data available.\nAmbr\u00f3sia (resources of 2.15 Mt at 5.08% Zn and 0.16% Pb: Fernandes et al., 2019a) is an epigenetic, structurally controlled deposit that is hosted in brecciated dolomites. The primary controlling reverse fault strikes N30\u00b0W and dips 60-80\u00b0SE and has experienced displacement by a transverse normal fault system that trends N20\u00b0E (Monteiro et al., 2007). The primary orebodies consist of sphalerite, galena, and pyrite veinlets overprinting tectonic fractures and stylolites, which were subsequently mylonitized (Monteiro et al., 2007). A secondary sphalerite mineralization event overprints the mylonitization (Monteiro et al., 2007).\nThe Fagundes occurrence is stratabound, hosted by stromatolitic dolomites, and in contact with black slates of the overlying Lapa Formation (Monteiro et al., 2006; Cunha et al., 2007). Orange to dark brown sphalerite, pyrite, and late galena are typically rhythmically banded, colloform, and display zonation of a later light brown sphalerite generation (Monteiro et al., 2006).\nThe source of the metals for the sulfide-zinc, as well as the silicate-zinc, deposits is still poorly constrained (Monteiro et al., 2006). Fernandes et al. (2019a) investigated the potential that the Serra do Garrote Formation, a thick siliciclastic package underlying the Serra do Po\u00e7o Verde Formation (Fig. 2), could be the source as it is enriched in zinc (up to 0.46% Zn). Based on principal component analyses of the lithogeochemical data, Cevik et al. (2021) identified geochemical signatures that were interpreted to be related to depletion in the Serra do Garrote Formation during orogenesis, supporting the hypothesis that this unit could be the potential source of zinc.\n\n2.2.1\nMorro Agudo deposit: Host rocks and orebodies\nMorro Agudo is one of Brazil\u2019s largest carbonate-hosted sulfide Pb-Zn deposits with resources of 20 Mt at 5% Zn and 2% Pb (Fernandes et al., 2019a). Although the discovery of other occurrences in the district (Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, and Morro do Cap\u00e3o) are not recent, little is known about their genesis and relationship with the Morro Agudo deposit.\nThere are four dolomitic lithofacies identified in the Morro Agudo deposit (e.g., Dardenne and Freitas-Silva, 1999; Misi et al., 1999, 2005; Cunha et al., 2000, 2007), which are described below, from base to surface:\n\n1.\nDolomite breccia, which is an intraformational breccia facies that occurs throughout the region and is composed of angular stromatolitic, laminated, and massive fine-grained dolomite clasts within dolomitic cement and disseminate sulfide minerals.\n\n\n2.\nDolarenite breccia with fragments and clasts of laminated or massive dolomites and dolarenites cemented together by sparry dolomite. Ore minerals typically occur as cement between brecciated dolomite clasts, disseminated, or cross-cutting veinlets.\n\n\n3.\nDolarenite dominated by fine- to coarse-grained, poorly sorted ooids, oncoids, intraclasts and aggregate grains cemented by micritic and sparitic dolomite. This unit represents the host rock for the majority of the mineralized zones where allochems have experienced partial to complete replacement by sphalerite and galena.\n\n\n4.\nDolomite-shale composed of millimetric to centimetric laminae of dolomite and carbonaceous shale. Laminated sulfides occur within this unit, along with chert and barite.\n\n\n\nMineralization is structurally and stratigraphically controlled (e.g., Misi et al., 2005; Monteiro et al., 2006; Cunha et al., 2007; Cordeiro et al., 2018). A principal normal fault (N15-20\u00b0W\/75\u00b0SW) limits the orebodies and mineralization is restricted to the hanging wall of the fault (Cunha et al., 2007); no significant mineralization has been discovered in the footwall. The orebodies are also dissected by a normal fault system (Monteiro et al., 2006). The NW principal fault was interpreted to have acted as a syn-sedimentary conduit for early mineralizing fluids and reactivated and utilized by the main stage of metal-bearing fluids during the Brasiliano orogenesis (Cunha et al., 2000; Monteiro et al., 2006).\nThe Morro Agudo deposit comprises eight mineralized zones, which are named, with increasing depth, N, M, J, K, L, G, H, and I (also referred to as Basal) (Cordeiro et al., 2018 and this study). Commonly orebodies J, K, and L are grouped together due to proximity to each other, same host rock, and similarity in ore textures (Fig. 4\n). Mineralized zones G and H contain small sulfide veinlets within carbonates.\nThe orebodies commonly contain multiple mineralization styles and several generations of minerals, such as sphalerite, galena, pyrite, dolomite, and quartz (Cordeiro et al., 2018 and this study). Orebody N, which is the closest to surface, is hosted within a lens of dolarenite within the upper dolomite-shale sequence. This orebody consists of 10% of the ore resource (Cordeiro et al., 2018) and contains thin (mm-cm) laminations of red and green chert, pyrite, hydrothermal dolomite, quartz, sphalerite, and galena. Minor folding and slumping is observed within this mineralized lens leading Cordeiro et al. (2018) to interpret the mineralization as syngenetic.\nOrebody M represents 2% of the ore resource (Cordeiro et al., 2018). Galena and minor sphalerite are associated with thick (<2 m) veins of white hydrothermal dolomite and pyrite and these veins are commonly oriented vertically in the host dolarenite.\nOrebody JKL, which is hosted within the dolarenite lithofacies, is the main orebody, accounting for 75% of the ore resources (Cordeiro et al., 2018). Massive and disseminated sphalerite and galena are associated with cubic pyrite, white hydrothermal dolomite, and quartz. Commonly sphalerite partially or completely replaces carbonate allochems. Late-stage remobilization and fracture-filling veinlets occur with white hydrothermal dolomite.\nThe GHI (Basal) orebody is hosted within dolomite breccias and dolarenites and represents 13% of the ore resources (Cordeiro et al., 2018). Sphalerite and galena occur as massive to disseminated ore in discontinuous lenses between breccia clasts and is commonly associated with coarse hydrothermal dolomite, quartz, and pyrite.\n\n\n2.2.2\nMorro Agudo Deposit: Fluid inclusion and isotope studies\n\nCunha et al. (2000) conducted fluid inclusion studies at Morro Agudo and reported the mean salinities and homogenization temperatures of the mineralizing fluids range from 4.9 to 13\u00a0wt% eq. NaCl and 80\u2013300\u00b0C, respectively, (Table A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A) leading Misi et al. (2005) to propose Morro Agudo was an Irish-type deposit.\nThe lower orebodies (M, JKL, and GHI (Basal)) yielded positive \u03b434S values ranging from\u00a0+10.6 to\u00a0+44.30\u2030, whereas sulfides from the N orebody range from \u22128.6 to\u00a0+2.7\u2030 (Table A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A) (Misi et al., 2005). These authors proposed that their respective sulfur isotope signature reflects the nature of their genesis (epigenetic for the lower orebodies vs. syngenetic for N). However, the relationship between isotopic signature and textural relationships within the orebodies was not documented.\nBased on the Pb isotope data of galena, Cunha et al. (2007) identified two populations (Table A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A): one associated with N orebody (mean 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04) and another with GHI (Basal) (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06), JKL (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07), and M (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13) orebodies, which have greater heterogeneity and radiogenic values than the upper N orebody. Vazante Pb isotope data (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05) is comparable with the samples from M, JKL, and Basal orebodies; samples from Fagundes (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03) and Ambr\u00f3sia (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04; 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02; 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a037.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07) are more radiogenic than the Morro Agudo deposit (Cunha et al., 2007).\nThe calculated Pb-Pb isotopic age in galena of 1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga reported by Freitas-Silva and Dardenne (1997) for the N orebody has been interpreted as the age of mineralization and overlaps with the age of carbonate deposition and diagenesis, which led various authors to propose a syn-sedimentary model for the N orebody. Iyer et al. (1992) reported a Pb-Pb isotopic age of 650\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0Ma of galena, which corresponds with the hypothesis that mineralization occurred during the Brasiliano Orogeny. Whole-rock Rb\/Sr isochron ages of the host rocks yielded ages of 680\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0Ma (Couto et al., 1981) corroborating the Pb-Pb ages calculated by Iyer et al. (1992).\n\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThe following methods were applied to characterize the various styles of mineralization and to compare with the barren zones from the Morro Agudo district.\n\n3.1\nCore logging and sampling\nDetailed logging and sampling was conducted on drill-cores from the exploration program of Nexa Resources (Fig. 3). Drill-core were selected across three sections of Morro Agudo mine, from the three occurrences (Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, and Morro do Cap\u00e3o), and regional exploration drilling to intersect sulfide mineralization, and to identify spatial variability in mineralized zones proximal and distal to the main fault. The three selected sections from the Morro Agudo deposit are used for resource estimation, mine exploration and planning to delineate and map the orebodies, and are, from north to south, 483, 580, 350 (Fig. 3). Five drill-holes were examined from section 483, 12 from section 580 (Fig. 4), and seven from section 350 totaling twenty-four drill-cores from Morro Agudo mine. The number of mapped drill-cores included 6 from Bento Carmelo (Fig. 5\n), 4 from Sucuri (Fig. 6\n), and 4 from Morro do Cap\u00e3o (Fig. 7\n) occurrences. Additionally, four drill-cores from regional exploration drill-core in the district were examined for comparison and referred to as Regional. Representative samples were collected from both barren and mineralized zones to understand the nature of the host rock and to determine mineralogy, textural relationships, geochemical signatures, ore vectors, and the evolution of mineralizing system.\n\n\n3.2\nMineralogical investigation\nEighty-three samples were made into polished thin sections from Morro Agudo, 15 from Bento Carmelo, 9 from Sucuri, 9 from Morro do Cap\u00e3o, and 8 from regional Morro Agudo drill-cores. Petrographic studies were conducted using an Olympus BX 60 transmitted\/reflected light optical microscope with an Olympus TH3 reflected light power source to understand the mineralogy, textural, and paragenetic relationships of the host rocks, hydrothermally altered, and mineralized samples.\nA FEI Quanta 650 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) in Queen\u2019s Facility for Isotope Research (QFIR) was used to aid the petrographic examination by investigating microscale textures and minerals. The ESEM is equipped with twin Bruker XFlash Si-Drift EDS detectors. The analyses were performed on carbon-coated polished thin section under high vacuum at 25\u00a0kV and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data was collected using Bruker Espirit 3.0 software to identify qualitative information about unknown mineral species. A JEOL JXA-8230 electron microprobe (EMP) at QFIR was used to analyze sphalerite and pyrite grains to evaluate the mineral composition of the identified generations in the various orebodies and occurrences in the district. The EMP is equipped with five two-crystal wavelength dispersive spectrometers, one energy dispersive spectrometer (silicon drift detector, SDD), and X-ray mapping and electron and back-scattered electron imaging capabilities.\nThe operating conditions of the microprobe analyses and the element standards used for sphalerite (Table A2 \u2013 electronic Appendix A) and for pyrite (Table A3 \u2013 electronic Appendix A) are listed in the appendix. A beam current of 50 nA, an accelerating potential of 20\u00a0kV, and a beam diameter of 2 \u00b5m was used for the sphalerite analysis. For the pyrite analysis, a beam current of 50 nA, an accelerating potential of 15\u00a0kV, and a beam diameter of 3 \u00b5m was used.\n\n\n3.3\nWhole-rock geochemistry\nWhole-rock geochemistry was conducted on 318 samples from various depths, rock types, orebodies, and occurrences at ALS Global. Major elements were analyzed through fused disc X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and loss-on-ignition (LOI) was quantified by furnace. Trace elements Ba, Ce, Cr, Cs, Dy, Er, Eu, Ga, Gd, Ge, Hf, Ho, La, Lu, Nb, Nd, Pr, Rb, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, and Zr were analyzed using lithium borate fusion, acid digestion (hydrofluoric, nitric, and hydrochloric) with an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) finish.\nAqua regia was used to digest As, Bi, Hg, In, Re, Sb, Se, Te, and Tl, which were then analyzed by ICP-MS. Base metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cu, Li, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sc, and Zn) were analyzed using a four-acid digestion (HNO3-HClO4-HF-HCl) followed by ICP-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurement. Total sulfur was analyzed using an induction furnace. To quantify samples with high metal concentrations (>10,000\u00a0ppm Zn or Pb), samples required additional analyses using four acid digestion (HNO3-HClO4-HF-HCl) with an ICP-AES finish.\n\n\n3.4\nPrincipal component analysis\nThe use of multivariate statistical analysis when applied to data inspection highlights relationships among multidimensional variables, such as the elemental composition of minerals and ores. Principal component analysis was applied to two datasets in the Morro Agudo District to identify possible patterns in the elemental compositions of the whole-rock lithogeochemistry and the EMP sphalerite mineral chemistry.\nThe centered log-ratio (clr) transformation was applied for principal component analysis, which alleviates the false correlation problem due to closure of the compositional data (Aitchison, 1982) and improves the detection of the elemental associations (Carranza, 2011). The general formula of the clr transformation is:\n\n\n\nc\nl\nr\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nln\n\n\nx\n1\n\n\ng\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n\u22ef\n;\nln\n\n\nx\nD\n\n\ng\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere g(x) is the geometric mean of the composition and \n\n\nx\nn\n\n\n is the nth composition of the sample. Python statistical programing language was used both for clr transformation and PCA.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nStratigraphic controls on zinc mineralization of the Morro Agudo district\nSix distinct rock units were identified within the Morro Agudo district: argillaceous dolomite, dolarenite, dolarenite breccia, dolomite, dolomite breccia, and phyllite (Figs. 4-7). Mineralization is hosted predominantly in the dolarenite and dolomite breccia units of the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation, which outcrops in the central part of the district (Fig. 3). It is underlain towards the east by phyllites of the Serra do Garrote Formation and overlain towards the west by the siliciclastic-rich Lapa Formation and Canastra Group, the latter by thrust fault contact (Fig. 3).\n\n4.1.1\nMorro Agudo deposit\nThe upper units comprise mainly argillaceous dolomites with intercalations of dolomitic shales, quartz-rich horizons, and locally host fine-grained pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sphalerite in thin laminations or disseminations (Fig. 4); it is correlated with the Lapa Formation by the Nexa exploration team (pers. comm.). Within these thick (up to 150\u00a0m) packages, there are thin lenses of impure dolarenite (<10\u00a0m and 3\u201312\u00a0m thick) containing clays and quartz (<0.5\u00a0mm), which host the upper N and M orebodies. The argillaceous dolomite is in conformable contact with underlying dolarenites from the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation, which are the main of host of the JKL orebody (15\u201330\u00a0m thick).\nThese dolarenites display remnants of sedimentary features, such as sub-rounded to rounded allochems that are cemented together by a micritic and sparitic dolomite matrix, and disseminated diagenetic, framboidal pyrite. Allochems present include radial, micritic, and concentric ooids, and peloids, as well as ooid packstones and concentrically stacked oncoids. Stylolites of organic matter are present in minor amounts and disseminated between allochems, and commonly replaced by pyrite and sphalerite in mineralized zones.\nDolarenite breccias, which are only present in the central part of the deposit (section 580, Fig.\u00a04B), typically occurs along contacts with dolomite breccias and contain clasts of oolitic dolomite. These rocks represent a transition between the dolarenites and the dolomite breccias.\nDolomite breccias underlie the dolarenite breccias and host the Basal orebody (Fig. 4), which ranges up to 20\u00a0m in thickness. It contains variable clasts of dolomite, dolarenite, stromatolites, and remnants of organic mats. The dolomite breccias are in sharp contact with the underlying Mocambo Member, which is a black, organic-rich, pyrite- and barite-bearing phyllite horizon. This unit, which is 5\u201315\u00a0m thick, occurs in the footwall of the mineralized zones throughout the deposit, and is the lowest unit intercepted by the exploration and mining drilling in the studied areas. East of the Principal fault, dolomite layers are ubiquitous (Fig. 4), which may represent the basal unit of the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation.\n\n\n4.1.2\nBento Carmelo\nLocated to the northeast of Morro Agudo, the Bento Carmelo area comprises various dolomitic units within tectonic blocks delineated by normal or thrust fault contacts (Fig. 5) occurring in the lowest units within the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation in this district. The exploration drill cores from this study intercept mainly the dolomite unit in the NE part of the occurrence, where it is laminated and the main host of the studied zinc mineralization (Fig. 5). It is underlain by a dolarenite unit (15\u00a0m thick) in one drill-hole (MAN-F-34) and contain thin lenses of dolomite breccias in MAN-F-31 (Fig. 5). Compania de Pesquisa de Recuros Minerais (CPRM) has drilled in the western part, and intercepted zinc mineralization as shown in Fig. 5, but the drill cores were not made available for this study. The mineralization in this sector is hosted by dolarenites and brecciated dolarenites of the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation and overlain by thick, predominantly siliciclastic units belonging to the Serra do Landim and Lapa formations (Dias et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.1.3\nSucuri\nThe units in the Sucuri occurrence include, from top to bottom (Fig. 6), thick sequences of argillaceous dolomite and black, organic-rich phyllites (120\u2013150\u00a0m), commonly interbedded with packages of dolomites or dolarenites (15\u201340\u00a0m thick), which are underlain by argillaceous dolomites. The argillaceous dolomites are similar to the ones at Morro Agudo, which are interpreted to be part of the Lapa Formation. A thick paleosol (20\u201330\u00a0m) covers the occurrence.\nThe impure dolarenites, with variable proportions of quartz and clays (<0.5\u00a0mm), display millimetric ooids, peloids, and intraclasts cut by quartz-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite veins\/veinlets and typically display increased proportions of quartz and other siliciclastic minerals. The contacts between siliciclastic units are typically gradational. However, the contacts bounding the mineralized zones in the dolarenite sequence display clear evidence of fault-related brecciation.\nThe zinc occurrence at Sucuri occurs for 20\u201350\u00a0m vertically is hosted in a lens of dolarenites, interpreted to be part of the Lapa Formation (Fig. 6) and an extension of the upper ore zones from the Morro Agudo by the Nexa exploration team (pers. comm.). However, the orebodies at Morro Agudo are underlain by a dolomite breccia, which are noticeably absent in the Sucuri area.\n\n\n4.1.4\nMorro do Cap\u00e3o\nThe Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrence is composed of argillaceous dolomites, carbonaceous phyllites, and a lower unit of laminated dolomites (Fig. 7). Contacts between the siliciclastic units are gradational, whereas sharp contacts occur between these units and dolomitic units. In the lower zones, pink to pink-gray dolomite alteration occurs in both laminated dolomites and dolomite breccias, reminiscent of ankerite alteration present in Vazante and Ambr\u00f3sia deposits (Monteiro et al., 2006), but was not identified elsewhere in the district. Zinc mineralization is observed in two of the four drill-holes examined (Fig.\u00a07B) and is hosted in dark argillaceous dolomites in shallower zones, which have been cross-cut by quartz veins, or in laminated dolomites at depth. Noticeably, dolarenites are absent from the mineralized zones (Fig.\u00a07B).\n\n\n\n4.2\nStyles of zinc mineralization and mineralogical and textural relationships\n\n4.2.1\nPre-mineralization, diagenetic and hydrothermal phases\nThe host dolarenite rocks present throughout the district are composed of ooids, peloids, and intraclasts with a micritic and sparitic dolomite cement. Nonplanar micritic and sparitic dolomite are also common in dolarenite and dolomite breccias, cementing clasts of dolomites. The early phases associated with diagenetic dolomitic cement include disseminated fine-grained, framboidal pyrite with very rare inclusions of corroded chalcopyrite.\nThe early hydrothermal phases are comprised of: (a) Rare barite veinlets in the JKL and Basal orebodies, which cross-cut the sparitic and micritic dolomite cement, and as inclusions in pyrite (Py-I) in the N orebody; (b) Euhedral hydrothermal pyrite in bituminous stylolites, quartz-carbonate veins, and overgrowing earlier generations of framboidal, diagenetic pyrite; (c) Fine- and coarse-grained hydrothermal quartz is present in variable amounts in both the mineralized and non-mineralized zones, being more abundant in the Morro Agudo deposit and Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences and minor at Bento Carmelo. Quartz occurs as veins, open-space-filling, and rarely disseminated throughout the host rocks. Within the N orebody, the quartz commonly contains micro-inclusions of Fe-oxide\/hydroxide, giving the red color to the rock (Fig.\u00a08\nA); and (d) Minor amounts of rutile and apatite. These phases were overprinted by base metal sulfide mineralization as described below.\n\n\n4.2.2\nSulfide mineralization\nThe styles of zinc mineralization in the Morro Agudo deposit and other occurrences in the district are shown in Figs. 8-12\n\n\n\n and described below. In the Morro Agudo deposit, mineralization is characterized by various textural types and generations of sphalerite and galena. The N orebody is depicted by laminations of sphalerite (Fig.\u00a08A; Fig.\u00a09A and B) with veins of galena (Fig.\u00a09A) replacing the silicified host dolomite.\nM orebody is characterized primarily by fracture-filling and veins of sphalerite, pyrite, galena, and hydrothermal dolomite (Fig.\u00a08B; Fig.\u00a09C). JKL orebody (Fig.\u00a08C; Fig.\u00a09D and E) exhibits the greatest diversity of mineralization styles occurring as disseminations, cement, partial replacement of allochems, organic matter, stylolites, and\/or earlier sulfides, or in veins. In the Basal orebody, ore is disseminated within the white dolomitic matrix between brecciated clasts or present as veinlets, and replacement of clasts is rare (Fig.\u00a08D; Fig.\u00a09F).\nAt Bento Carmelo, sphalerite and galena within the dolomite rocks either replaces bituminous stylolites, early pyrite, or are in association with quartz-carbonate-pyrite veins (Fig.\u00a08E; Fig.\u00a09G). Sulfide mineralization at Sucuri contains sphalerite, galena, and pyrite (Fig.\u00a08F; Fig.\u00a09H) as hydrothermal cement, disseminations, replacement, and veins, with the galena overprinting earlier sphalerite. Sphalerite and galena also commonly replace and fill corroded pyrite veins. These ore textures are similar to ore styles found at Morro Agudo. At Morro do Cap\u00e3o, mineralization typically occurs as late stringer, centimetric veinlets of quartz-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite replaced by sphalerite or galena (Fig.\u00a08G, Fig.\u00a09I) in the upper argillaceous dolomites and phyllites sequences.\nThree main types of sphalerite are documented in the Morro Agudo District (Fig.\u00a09A, D and F; Fig.\u00a010A and D; Fig.\u00a011A, C and F). The earlier generations, which are referred to as sphalerite I (Sp-I) and sphalerite II (Sp-II), are found in all Morro Agudo orebodies, Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences, with Sp-I being the most abundant. Sphalerite III (Sp-III) is rarer and more common within the JKL and Basal orebodies.\nSp-I is the coarsest of the three generations and typically yellow-orange. It occurs as massive aggregates (Fig.\u00a010B and D), disseminated (Fig.\u00a010G), as a cement of allochems or clasts (Fig.\u00a010G and H; Fig.\u00a011C and H), or in veins with quartz\u00a0+\u00a0carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite; however in the N orebody, the yellow sphalerite (Sp-I) typically overprint micritic (Fig.\u00a09A and B) and sparitic dolomite (Fig.\u00a010D), fine-grained quartz (Fig.\u00a010B), and pyrite along favorable laminations (Fig.\u00a010A), and in some places occur coeval with hydrothermal calcite. Sp-I commonly includes fine-grained, acicular phlogopite lathes in the JKL and Basal orebodies (Fig.\u00a011D).\nIn the Morro Agudo deposit and Sucuri occurrence, Sp-I fills corroded pyrite veins and disseminations and is associated with hydrothermal dolomite (Fig.\u00a010G and H; Fig.\u00a011G and H). Medium- and coarse-grained hydrothermal, subhedral to euhedral planar saddle, or baroque, Fe-rich dolomite occur as veins or open-space filling and overprint the micrite and sparite in the mineralized zones associated with sphalerite and weakly mineralized zones around the orebodies. The hydrothermal dolomite is interpreted to be coeval with early sphalerite (Sp-I and Sp-II) and they are overprinted by late sphalerite (Sp-III) and galena (Gn-II).\nPyrite overgrowths and euhedral pyrite (Py-II) are in sharp contact with sphalerite (Sp-I), as denoted by euhedral grain boundaries (Fig.\u00a010B). Pyrite (Py-II) overgrows early diagenetic pyrite (Py-I) with inclusions of barite (Fig.\u00a010C). Interstitial and skeletal galena (Gn-I) fills dissolution features or overprints Sp-I as displayed by the irregular grain boundaries and embayments (Fig.\u00a09C, D, E and H; Fig.\u00a010A, E-H; Fig.\u00a011G).\nSphalerite at Bento Carmelo is coarse, euhedral, and tan and coeval with saddle dolomite and minor disseminated pyrite (Fig.\u00a011E), and partially overprints earlier microcrystalline quartz veins and bituminous, pyrite-bearing stylolites. At Morro do Cap\u00e3o, crystalline, yellow sphalerite (Sp-I) and galena partially replaces earlier quartz-carbonate\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite veinlets within the organic-rich host carbonate (Fig.\u00a011F).\nThroughout all orebodies of the Morro Agudo deposit and Sucuri occurrence, Sp-II is microcrystalline, appears black in plane-polarized light, and commonly replaces the corroded rims of coated allochems and margins of Sp-I (Fig.\u00a010A, D, G and H; Fig.\u00a011A and C). Sp-II is also found disseminated, void filling, or overprinting sparitic dolomite (Fig.\u00a011H) or microcrystalline quartz, and is typically associated with medium- and, less commonly, coarse-grained hydrothermal dolomite and quartz. At Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrence, rare black sphalerite (Sp-II) replaces Sp-I in veinlets (Fig.\u00a011F). Hydrothermal quartz is anhedral and infills veins, open-spaces, or disseminated with hydrothermal dolomite.\nSp-III is most common in the JKL orebody, but also occurs throughout the deposit except for orebody N. It is fine-grained, red, typically occupies late veinlets and is commonly associated with a late galena (Gn-II) (Fig.\u00a09D; Fig.\u00a011A and B). Gn-II occurs in veins or filling void and corroded zones in Sp-I and Sp-II (Fig.\u00a011B).\nThese observations and the proposed paragenesis, shown in Fig. 12, advanced the knowledge of the relationships of various types of sphalerite with the other ore-related minerals and the various generations of carbonates compared to previous studies on Morro Agudo by Cordeiro et al. (2018) and references therein. Moreover, it compares Morro Agudo deposit and other occurrences.\n\n\n\n4.3\nMineral chemistry of sulfides\nThe composition of different generations of sphalerite and pyrite were analyzed by EMP to evaluate their spatial or temporal variability between orebodies and occurrences and to assist in further understanding the evolution of fluid-rock interactions and vectoring to exploration. The results of the sphalerite mineral chemistry are reported in (Tables A4-A9 electronic Appendix A).\n\n4.3.1\nMineral chemistry of pyrite\nThe most commonly detected trace elements were As, Mo, Ni, and Cu and these elements have not revealed any significant compositional differences between pyrite associated with and without base metal mineralization. The elements Ag, Bi, Cd, Co, Mn, Pb, Sb, Se, Tl, and Zn contents were below detection limit in most of the analyzed pyrite grains.\n\n\n4.3.2\nMineral chemistry of sphalerite\nThe three generations of sphalerite (Sp-I, Sp-II, Sp-III) identified based on textural relationships and color were analyzed using EMP for Zn, Fe, Cd, and S. Silver, Co, Cu, Ga, Ge, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Se were also analyzed, but were commonly in concentrations below detection limits (Tables A4-A9 \u2013 electronic Appendix A). The main variation in composition of the various generations of sphalerite in the various orebodies and occurrences are shown in a Cd:Fe binary diagram (Fig. 13\n). The Fe and Cd compositions in Sp-I and Sp-II overlap in the various orebodies and occurrences, and some of the Sp-III has higher Fe contents than Sp-I and Sp-II (Fig.\u00a013A).\nIn most orebodies for the various sections and in the occurrences (Fig.\u00a013B), sphalerite (Sp-I, Sp-II and Sp-III) has Cd contents between 0.3 and 0.65\u00a0wt% and Fe between 0.75 and 2.70\u00a0wt% (referred to as Cluster 1). In Cluster 1, most of the Sp-I and Sp-II in section 350 yielded a narrow range of Cd content (0.58\u20130.69\u00a0wt%), with the Basal Sp-I and Sp-II yielding the lowest Fe content (0.75\u20131.54\u00a0wt%), and Sp-I from the M and N orebodies generating the highest Fe contents (2.22\u20132.62\u00a0wt%) and intermediate Fe concentrations (1.68\u20132.19\u00a0wt%), respectively. The majority of Sp-I and Sp-II from Sucuri and about half of the Sp-I from Bento Carmelo plot in the main trend (Cluster 1).\nFour other distinct clusters were identified (Fig. 13): Clusters (2) and (3) include sphalerite with Fe contents (<0.65\u00a0wt%) lower than the Cluster 1 and variable Cd contents: Cluster (2) with higher Cd content (0.69 to 0.94\u00a0wt%) in Sp-I and Sp-II in Basal and JKL orebodies in section 580, and Cluster (3) with lower Cd content (0.35\u20130.41\u00a0wt%) mainly in Sp-I from some samples of Bento Carmelo. Cluster (4) contains Sp-I with high Cd (0.73\u20130.85\u00a0wt%) and Fe (1.78\u20131.97\u00a0wt%) from the JKL orebody, predominantly from the central section (section 580). Cluster (5) has Cd contents lower than the Cluster 1 (<0.3\u00a0wt%) and a narrow Fe range (0.6 to 1.3\u00a0wt%) comprising some samples from JKL orebody from section 580, as well as Sp-I and Sp-II from Basal orebody from section 350 and all Sp-I from Morro do Cap\u00e3o. Uniquely, all analyzed samples from Bento Carmelo had detectable quantities of Hg (498\u20131093\u00a0ppm), and >60% of analyzed samples had detectable amounts of Cu (130\u20131250\u00a0ppm) (Table A8 \u2013 electronic Appendix A).\n\n\n4.3.3\nPCA of sphalerite mineral chemistry\nDue to the complexity of these clusters, PCA analyses were conducted to evaluate other possible trends. Only the four elements (Cd, Fe, S, and Zn) detected in all samples were chosen for the PCA. The elements projected on the PC1 vs. PC2 plane (Fig. 14\n) account for 99.94% of the element variability. Notably the clusters described above were also delineated in the PC1 vs PC2 binary plot. Moreover, it highlights the distinction between most of the Bento Carmelo sphalerite compared to the other orebodies and occurrences, and the Morro do Cap\u00e3o signature within PC2- (see box plots in Fig. 14), as the samples of this occurrence plots in the Cluster 5.\n\n\n\n4.4\nLithogeochemistry\n\n4.4.1\nLithogeochemical signature of the Morro Agudo district\nThe results of the lithogeochemistry are reported in the electronic supplementary material (Appendix B). The ore-related elemental concentrations were displayed in boxplots to compare the signatures in the various orebodies and occurrences and their respective host rocks (N host, M host, etc.) (Figs. 15 and 16\n\n). Barium, In, and Se were added to compare with other districts. Morro Agudo deposit has the highest contents of Zn (mean 5.6%) and Pb (mean 2.6%) (Fig. 15), and other ore-related elements (As, Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Sb, Tl, Fe2O3) (Fig. 16) compared to the occurrences. Morro do Cap\u00e3o and Sucuri occurrences typically have intermediate values of the ore-related elements, and the lowest mean concentrations occur in Bento Carmelo occurrence. The overlying and underlying barren siliciclastic units (argillaceous dolomite of the Lapa Formation and phyllite of the Mocambo Member) and orebody N of the Morro Agudo deposit have higher concentrations of Ag, Ba, Cu, and Se relative to the other orebodies. To fully evaluate if the ore-related elements varied between mineralized and weakly mineralized zones, these elements (Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Sb, Se, Tl, Fe2O3, and S) were plotted downhole (Fig. 17\n), revealing enrichments in the zones between the high-grade ore of the Basal and JKL orebodies.\nThe average ore grades from Bento Carmelo are 0.6% Zn and 0.04% Pb, but locally enriched up to 1.37% Zn and 0.3% Pb. At Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences average ore grades are 3.3% Zn and 0.7% Pb and 0.9% Zn and 0.13% Pb, respectively (Fig.\u00a015A; Table 1\n).\nZn\/Cd ratios have a wide range in the various sections and orebodies in Morro Agudo deposit and occurrences with no distinctive ratio for any specific orebody or occurrence, and with an overall mean of 182 (Fig. 15). Notably, the Zn\/Pb ratios are higher in the orebodies and occurrences (mean 121) compared to their respective host rocks (mean 5.2).\n\n\n4.4.2\nPCA of whole-rock lithogeochemistry\nDue to the variety of mineralization styles, host rocks, and elements that could be involved in the mineralizing processes, PCA was applied to the whole-rock lithogeochemistry dataset. The first PCA was conducted with the entire database including all mineralized zones and proximal and distal host rocks (Fig.\u00a018\nA). The elements projected on the PC1 vs. PC2 plane account for\u00a0\u223c62% of the element variability (PC1\u00a0=\u00a051.12%; PC2\u00a0=\u00a011.08%), and three populations were identified based on their elemental associations and loadings.\nThe largest population is composed of samples from N, M, JKL, and Basal orebodies hosted in dolarenites, and brecciated dolarenites and dolomites, and carbonate rocks of Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences. This population is predominantly in the PC1- and PC2- quadrant, and loaded by the elements Zn, Pb, S, Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe2O3, Hg, In, Sb, Se, and Tl, therefore characterizing the geochemical signature of the mineralized system. Indium and Se also plot in PC1- but plot close to zero in PC2.\nThe second population is located in PC1+, loaded by Al2O3, K2O, SiO2, Ba, Bi, Cr, Li, Ni, V, Zr, and rare earth elements (REEs), and consists predominantly of siliciclastic-rich rocks, and impure carbonates. This includes phyllites from Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, and Morro do Cap\u00e3o, host rocks of N orebody, the Mocambo Member, and argillaceous dolomites from the Lapa Formation at Morro Agudo deposit, Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences. Although the bulk of samples from Sucuri occurrence are within this population, dolarenite samples fall in the first population.\nThe third population comprises weakly mineralized and mineralized carbonate rocks of Bento Carmelo and few samples of the Basal host dolomitic rock. This population is characterized by PC1- and PC2+, including CaO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, SrO, C, Ge, Mo, Re, Sn, and W, which is distinct compared to most samples from Morro Agudo deposit and the other occurrences. This similarity in composition supports the interpretation that Bento Carmelo units are correlated to some of the Basal orebody hosts, which are the lowest units in the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio Formation in the district.\nA subsequent PC analysis was conducted utilizing the suite of ore-related elements in the samples that displayed some evidence of hydrothermal alteration (i.e., dolomitization, pyritization, silicification) and\/or mineralization to highlight possible elemental associations that could distinguish between orebodies and\/or proximal and distal alteration (Fig.\u00a018B). The samples were separated into high-grade (>1000\u00a0ppm) and low-grade\/non-mineralized (<1000\u00a0ppm) samples to further elucidate the proximal and distal alteration zones. PC1+ (45.6%) is loaded by Cd, Zn, Hg, Pb, and S (from highest to lowest loadings) and comprises the vast majority of samples with >1000\u00a0ppm Zn. This PC1+\u00a0population is divided into two subsets in relation to PC2 (18.8% of variability): (1) PC2- with loadings of Zn, Hg, and Cd and (2) PC1+\u00a0with Pb, S (loadings reported in descending order), which distinguish samples with variable proportions of sphalerite and galena. PC1- is characterized by Fe2O3, Ag, As, In, Sb, Se, and Tl, being most of these elements are commonly associated with pyrite in sedimentary and hydrothermal systems. However, no discernible cluster was observed among the Morro Agudo orebodies and occurrences, suggesting these systems are related to similar mineralizing conditions.\n\n\n4.4.3\nMass Balance: Isocon diagrams\nTo further evaluate the elemental association identified in the PCA, isocon plots were constructed to determine elements that were mobile or immobile during fluid-rock interaction following the method by Grant (1986), Grant (2005) (Fig. A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A). The least altered samples were determined by low or absence of silicification and hydrothermal sulfides, a Ca:Mg molar ratio around 1.0, which is typical of the regional dolomites, and background levels of base metals. The reference isocon line was plotted based on typical immobile elements Al, Ti, and Zr in similar systems (Fernandes et al., 2019a, b).\nThe ore-related elements identified in the PCA (Zn, Pb, S, Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe2O3, Hg, In, Sb, Se, and Tl) were gained throughout the Morro Agudo district, except in Bento Carmelo, which only had significant gains in Zn, Pb, and Cd. Silver, In, and Se were not always detectable in the least altered samples.\nTypically, throughout the orebodies, sections, and occurrences of the district, C, CaO, MgO, and SiO2 were lost. However, SiO2 was gained at Sucuri and Bento Carmelo occurrences due to the mineralization being hosted locally in quartz veins\/veinlets.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nEvidence for epigenetic mineralization for the Morro Agudo district\nThe fact that various generations of sphalerite and galena replaced the diagenetic cement and occur in veins cutting the diagenetic phases in all mineralized zones provide evidence that the mineralization is epigenetic, postdating diagenesis. These ore minerals are coeval with hydrothermal Fe-rich, saddle dolomite and overgrowths of hydrothermal pyrite and with minor quartz in all orebodies and occurrences (Figs. 8-12), similar to various Mississippi Valley Type deposits (e.g., Leach et al., 2005; Leach et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2018; de Oliveira et al., 2019). Furthermore, except for a cluster from Bento Carmelo (Cluster 3 \u2013 Fig. 13; Fig. 14), there is an overlap of compositions of sphalerite from the various orebodies and occurrences. This interpretation also includes the N and M orebodies that have been previously interpreted as syn-exhalative by (Misi et al., 2005; Cordeiro et al., 2018). Our study shows that in the N orebody hydrothermal sphalerite and galena occur associated with hydrothermal pyrite replacing syn-diagenetic barite- (Fig.\u00a010C) and chert-bearing dolomite layers, preserving the original fabric (Fig.\u00a09A, B; Fig. 12), which was misinterpreted as stratiform by previous work. In all the samples collected for M orebody in this study, sphalerite and galena occur in fracture-filling and veins associated with pyrite and dolomite, typical of epithermal systems. Moreover, our studies demonstrated that the N and M orebodies have sphalerite compositions (Fig. 13) and ore signatures similar to the JKL and Basal orebodies (Fig. 15; Fig. 16; Fig. 18), therefore suggesting that they formed coevally and by similar processes.\nHowever, the presence of chert, minor slumping and folding of the laminated styles of mineralization, the unique \u03b434S and Pb isotope signatures of the N orebody (Table A1 \u2013 Electronic Appendix A) compared to the other orebodies led researchers to propose that an early stage of exhalative mineralization occurred in this orebody and was partially overprinted by a later mineralization typical of the other orebodies (Misi et al., 1999, 2005; Cunha et al., 2007; Cordeiro et al., 2018). The lower \u03b434S isotopic composition reported by Misi et al. (2005) and Iyer et al. (1992) is interpreted in this study to be related to the fractionation of S related to replacement of early barite by the ore-related sulfides (sulfate reduction; Seal, 2006), as denoted by the high Ba-content in N host rocks and overprinting of early barite (Fig.\u00a010C; Fig.\u00a016B). However, more studies are required to further address the differences in S, as well as Pb isotopic compositions, integrating paragenesis and mineral compositions and considering the possible sources for these elements.\n\n\n5.2\nProcesses related to a wide range of sphalerite compositions\nThe fact that the three generations of sphalerite identified in this study yielded a wide range of Fe and Cd contents, which were grouped in 5 clusters (Fig. 13; Fig. 14), could be related to various factors including: (a) Interaction of similar fluids with host rocks with distinct compositions; (b) Distinct hydrothermal events; (c) Similar hydrothermal fluid changing in physico-chemical conditions during the ore stage; (d) Mixing of fluids with distinct Zn, Fe and Cd compositions during episodic fluid flow during the same major event. However, the hypothesis that similar fluid interacted with host rocks with distinct compositions is not supported by the lithogeochemical data, as the various host rocks have similar range of Cd and Fe contents (Fig. 16).\nDistinct hydrothermal events within the Morro Agudo District could explain the discrepancy between Pb-Pb isotopic data and calculated ages of galena (1.1\u20131.0\u00a0Ga: Freitas-Silva and Dardenne, 1997 and 650\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0Ma: Iyer et al., 1992), which would support the syn-sedimentary or syn-orogenic models, respectively. However, the fact that both sphalerite, galena, and pyrite replaced the diagenetic phases and early hydrothermal phases (e.g., Fig.\u00a010B, C, E-H; Fig.\u00a011A, C, F-H) exclude the possibility of these minerals being deposited coeval with sedimentation in the Mesoproterozoic; moreover, the overlap in composition of the various textural types of sphalerite does not support two major distinct processes and events.\nFluid inclusion data for the Morro Agudo deposit reported in Misi et al. (2005) reveal wide ranges of fluid temperatures (80\u00b0 to 300\u00b0 C) and compositions (5\u201313\u00a0wt% equiv. NaCl; Table A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A). In fluids of these compositions, typical of Mississippi-type deposits, the ore-related elements are transported mainly as Cl- complexes, and the incorporation of Fe and Cd into the sphalerite structure depends on temperature, pressure, salinity of the fluid and the amount of reduced sulfur in the fluid (Schwartz, 2000; Cook et al., 2009; Tauson et al., 2010; Pfaff et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021). If a single ore fluid containing all ore-related elements was involved in the genesis of Morro Agudo District, the variation in the Fe:Cd ratios in sphalerite would be expected to change consistently as the fluid evolves with time due to cooling, changes in pH and in the metal budget, yielding distinct compositions for each generation. However, the overlap in composition of Fe and Cd in three generations of sphalerite reported in this study does not support this model.\nTherefore, the broad range of Fe:Cd in the sphalerite mineral chemistry (Fig. 13) and the PCA results (Fig. 14), yielding distinct Cd, Fe, and Zn loadings, are better explained by mixing of ore fluids with different metal contents. These fluids, probably with various salinities and temperatures, would have moved through numerous pathways and interacted with different source rocks with variable metal concentrations. The range of Fe and Cd contents in the three generations of sphalerite (Fig.\u00a013A) and various mineralized zones (Fig.\u00a013B) would be due to episodically mixing of variable proportions of these distinct fluids. This model would also explain the wide ranges of fluid temperatures and compositions reported by Misi et al. (2005; Table A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A), and the discrepancies in the Pb isotopic data reported by Iyer et al. (1992) and Freitas-Silva and Dardenne (1997), due to distinct fluid and metal sources.\n\n\n5.3\nGenesis of the Morro Agudo district\nAt the Morro Agudo deposit, mineralization occurs almost exclusively in the hanging wall of the NW Principal fault suggesting that this structure may have served as the main conduit for hydrothermal fluids. However, the complex variation in composition of the ore in this deposit indicates that there were other conduits for fluids with distinct compositions. The Principal fault has been reactivated as a reverse fault during the late stages of the Brasiliano orogeny, posterior to the mineralization, obscuring the original geometry during ore deposition. Nevertheless, the absence of ore in the fault footwall is probably due to erosion prior to the reverse movement, as the outcropping units from the footwall are correlated to the units that underlie the ore host units.\nBased on the results of this study, and data from the literature, we propose an interpretation for the Morro Agudo district evolution and ore genesis (Fig. 19\n), as summarized below:\n\n1)\nSedimentation of carbonate muds, particles, and skeletal fragments in the Morro do Calc\u00e1rio and Lapa formations occurred in a subtidal depositional environment (Dardenne, 2000; Rodrigues et al., 2012; Slezak et al., 2014). The host carbonates of the Bento Carmelo occurrence represent a deeper carbonate succession, denoted by their unique geochemical signature in PCA (Fig.\u00a018A), exposed by faulting (Fig. 5). The host rocks of upper N orebody of the Morro Agudo deposit and Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences have higher input of siliciclastic components (Fig.\u00a016B; Fig.\u00a018A) representing the shifting nature of the basinal environment and higher rates of weathering of proximal crystalline rocks.\n\n\n2)\nDiagenesis with dolomitization of the limestones occurred, generating higher porosity and permeability, coeval with formation of pyrite (disseminated and in stylolites),\n\n\n3)\nEarly hydrothermal alteration, including barite, pyrite, quartz, apatite, replaced the diagenetic cement or in veinlets.\n\n\n4)\nMetalliferous fluid flow started possibly prompted by the compressive event associated with the onset of the Brasiliano orogeny (Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Cordeiro et al., 2018). Moderately saline, metalliferous fluids (supported by Cunha et al., 2000; Misi et al., 2005 fluid inclusion data; Table A1 \u2013 electronic Appendix A) with distinct compositions may have migrated eastward along lithological contacts and faults away from the incipient forefront of the Brasiliano orogeny. During migration, these various fluids have scavenged metals from the Vazante siliciclastic units (Cevik et al., 2021) and\/or basement rocks (Cunha et al., 2007) transporting variable contents of Zn, Cd, Fe, and Pb and most of the other ore related elements as Cl-complexes (Schwartz, 2000; Pfaff et al., 2011; Zhong et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016).\n\n\n5)\nMetalliferous fluids with distinct compositions mixed with S-bearing fluids or hydrocarbon traps and interacted with pyritic host dolomites in various stratigraphic levels of the Morro Agudo deposit, Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences (Figs. 4-7; Table 1) leading to the formation of the major orebodies and mineralized zones (Fig.\u00a019A). Mixing of mineralizing fluids was more limited at Bento Carmelo occurrence as denoted by the more constrained sphalerite composition (Fig. 13; Fig. 14), and minor mineralization. Ore-related minerals replaced diagenetic and early hydrothermal phases and formed in the early stages of hydrothermal euhedral pyrite grains and overgrowths in diagenetic pyrite, coeval with sphalerite-I (Fig.\u00a010B); pyrite also precipitated in the zones surrounding the high-grade mineralization, forming a halo with elevated contents of As, Ag, In, Fe2O3, In, Sb, Se, and Tl (Fig.\u00a016B; Fig.\u00a018B). Sphalerite-II and galena formed sequentially (Fig.\u00a010A, E, F; Fig.\u00a011C, F-H).\n\n\n6)\nProgressive mixing and\/or subsequent pulse(s) of fluids with high contents of Pb formed the later-stage galena and late, commonly Fe-rich sphalerite (Sp-III; Fig.\u00a011A and B; Fig. 13) veinlets that cross-cut the earlier generations of sulfides (Fig.\u00a019B), primarily in the JKL and Basal orebodies.\n\n\n7)\nLater reactivation of the main fault zones and new faults offset the mineralized zones in the Morro Agudo deposit.\n\n\n\nThe evidence reported in this study and the model proposed above suggests that the Morro Agudo district was formed by sustained circulation of metalliferous fluids of distinct compositions analogous to other Mississippi Valley deposits worldwide (e.g., Leach et al., 2005; Wilkinson et al., 2005), being one of the few examples of Proterozoic age (Taylor et al., 2009; Leach et al., 2010).\n\n\n5.4\nComparison with other Carbonate-hosted base metal deposits in the Vazante group and implications for exploration\nThe fact that silicate zinc and various styles of sulfide Pb-Zn mineralization occur hosted in the dolomitic units of the Vazante Group (Table 2\n) provides an excellent opportunity for examining the features associated with these systems and apply for exploration in this setting and other Proterozoic carbonate basins. Both silicate and sulfide base metal mineralization are hosted mainly in Proterozoic dolomitic units interbedded with siliciclastic layers, in proximity of fault zones that have been reactivated throughout the evolution of the system, and are associated with hydrothermal dolomite, quartz and pyrite (Table 2 and references therein). Moreover, the suite of ore-related element is similar (e.g., Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe2O3, Hg, In, Sb, Se and Tl). For most of the deposits the mineralization is interpreted as epigenetic and related to the Brasiliano orogeny (Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Cordeiro et al., 2018), and the distinct ore mineralogy (sulfide vs. silicate) is attributed to differences in the processes at the site of deposition: willemite precipitated coeval with hematite (both replacing hydrothermal dolomite) in zones where the mineralized fluids mixed with meteoric water (Olivo et al., 2018 and references therein); however, sphalerite and galena are coeval with dolomite and pyrite, and have formed in sites where ore fluids encountered reduced sulfur reservoir similar to Mississippi Valley type deposits (Monteiro et al., 2006, 2007; Cordeiro et al., 2018, this study).\nIn the Ambr\u00f3sia deposit, the fact that most of the mineralized zones are stratabound, and the ore is rhythmically banded, with colloform, zoned pyrite, sphalerite, and galena, led Monteiro et al. (2006, 2007) to propose that the ore formed late during the burial diagenesis. Nonetheless, the style of alteration (e.g., silicification, dolomitization and a Fe-rich carbonate alteration halo), and signature of the ore are similar to the other sulfide deposits (Table 2).\nThe discoveries of various occurrences and increased resources in the Morro Agudo District (e.g., Bonsucesso, Bento Carmelo, Sucuri, Morro do Cap\u00e3o: Nexa Resources; Olivo et al., 2018; Fernandes et al., 2019a) show the relevance of Meso\/Neoproterozoic carbonate sequences as prospective exploration targets worldwide compared to the traditional Paleozoic or younger MVT districts (e.g., Leach et al., 2005; Leach et al., 2010). The common features described above share some similarities with those documented in other Proterozoic (e.g., Nanisivik, Canada: Sherlock et al., 2004; Turner, 2011; Hnatyshin et al., 2016; Gayna River, Canada: Ootes et al., 2013; Black Angel, Greenland: Horn et al., 2019; Partin et al., 2021) and Paleozoic MVT districts (e.g., Upper Silesia, Poland: Heijlen et al., 2003; Illinois-Kentucky, USA: Pelch et al., 2015; Pine Point, Canada: Szmihelsky et al., 2021) and should be taken in consideration when exploring for similar styles of mineralization in other basins.\nWithin the Morro Agudo District, the stratigraphic distribution of mineralization along the lithological contact between the Lapa and Morro do Calc\u00e1rio formations (Fig.\u00a019C) represents a prospective zone for Zn-Pb sulfide mineralization. Based on the similarities between Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o with the Morro Agudo orebodies (Table 1), these zones should be further explored. At Bento Carmelo, the zones that were studied here were weakly mineralized and exhibit a distinct sphalerite composition, but the western mineralized site studied by CPRM (Fig. 5) was considered an attractive target by Dias et al. (2018). Furthermore, this study revealed the occurrence of a more extensive halo of alteration containing pyrite and associated with enrichments in Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe2O3, Hg, In, Sb, Se and Tl (Fig. 17; Fig. 18), that should be considered when exploring in the district.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study revealed that:\n\n1)\nThe ore of the Morro Agudo district is stratigraphically controlled within host dolomitic rocks of the Lapa and Morro do Calc\u00e1rio formations.\n\n\n2)\nThe main mineralization phase is composed of multiple generations of sphalerite and galena associated with hydrothermal pyrite and Fe-rich dolomite that crosscut, replace, and overprint early diagenetic carbonates and pyrite.\n\n\n3)\nThe ore signature is comprised of Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, In, Sb, Se and Tl, that through the application of PCA integrated with paragenesis, could be differentiated between proximal zones of mineralization and distal hydrothermal alteration. These relationships should be further investigated to be applied as vector towards the ore zones (i.e., Ag, As, In, Sb, Se, and Tl in the more distal mineralized zones associated with hydrothermal pyrite, and with addition of Zn, Cd, Hg, and Pb towards the high-grade sphalerite and galena ore).\n\n\n4)\nThe variable compositions of Fe and Cd in the various generations of sphalerite and zones suggest prolonged fluid flow with complex mixing of multiple fluids for the Morro Agudo district.\n\n\n5)\nThe orebodies of the Morro Agudo deposit are epigenetic, including the N orebody which has proposed in previous studies to have been syngenetic, forming akin to MVT mineralization through progressive and episodic mixing of mineralizing fluids of various compositions interacting with S-bearing trap zones.\n\n\n6)\nMineralization within the Sucuri and Morro do Cap\u00e3o occurrences formed through similar processes as those at Morro Agudo; Bento Carmelo occurrence displays unique host rock geochemistry and sphalerite compositions suggesting it formed from distinct fluids or processes.\n\n\n7)\nThis is one of the rare examples of Proterozoic deposits similar to MVT around the world and these findings can assist in the exploration in the Vazante basin and similar geological settings.\n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe formation of corundum (Al2O3) is genetically associated with Al-rich and Si-poor igneous\/metamorphic environments (e.g., Simonet et al., 2008). Many corundum deposits with economic value have been formed from weathering and mechanical transport of primary deposits (e.g., Giuliani et al., 2014). Igneous corundum deposits are known where corundum mainly occurs as xenocrysts in alkali basalts (e.g., Garnier et al., 2005), or as megacrysts in syenitic pegmatites (e.g., Sorokina et al., 2017). However, metamorphic rocks represent the most important economic source of corundum, where metasomatic reactions between fluids and wall rocks (e.g., desilication) play a critical role in their formation (Hughes et al., 2017).\nAlthough corundum-rich rocks display a worldwide distribution, only four deposits have been recognised within South America. Three of these deposits have been formed by mechanical sedimentary processes (placer-type) and are located in Minas Gerais, Brazil (Epstein et al., 1994), in Orosmayo Region, Jujuy Province, northwest Argentina (Harris et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2019), and Mercaderes-R\u00edo Mayo, Colombia (Keller et al., 1985; Romero and Rodriguez-Vargas, 2002). The fourth deposit corresponds to Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas, northern Chile, which was discovered in 2003 by Exploraberg Company. It has only been preliminarily studied by Berg and Tidy (2009), who described it as crystalline rocks hosting corundum sapphire-type porphyroblasts immersed in a b\u00f6hmite-rich matrix, whose origin is related to a metamorphic contact between aluminous sedimentary rocks and a lower Cretaceous pluton.\nThus, the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas sapphire-bearing rocks represent an exceptional case to constrain the geological processes implicated in the genesis of this unusual deposit during a subduction tectonic regime. This contribution aims to present the first detailed geological study about sapphire-bearing rocks at the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas, combining classical geological techniques with high-resolution mineralogical and chemical analyses. The Results are used to classify this deposit and establish a genetic model, which could be useful to explore other corundum-rich occurrences in northern Chile.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nA detailed surface geological mapping at the scale of 1:15.000 and 1:5000 was carried out in the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas area to define the different lithological units, their contact relationships, and their spatial correlation with the occurrence and distribution of sapphire-rich rocks. A total of sixty samples were collected from all lithological units, which were petrographically described and classified using a Motic SMZ-168TL binocular lens. A subset of thirty representative thin sections were studied using a transmitted light microscope (Motic BA310 POL\u00a0+\u00a0EPI) at the Universidad de Atacama (UDA), Chile, in order to define textural and mineralogical features within the samples. To precisely identify mineralogical phases, six samples were analysed using qualitative X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) at Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Norte (UCN), Chile. These analyses were done using a Siemens D5000 X-ray diffractometer, with a Cu-K\u03b1 (1.5405\u00a0\u00c5) radiation source, 30\u00a0mA current, 40\u00a0kV voltage, a 3-70\u00b0 angle of incidence and a step size of 0.020\u00b0 over a 2\u03b8 range of 3-70\u00b0. In addition, ten samples were analysed using automated mineralogy (Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning electron microscopy, QEMSCAN) at Maini, UCN, to obtain spatial high-resolution mineralogical and microtextural data of sapphire-bearing rocks.\nFurthermore, nine samples were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to obtain morphological data of sapphire crystals, using a JEOL JSM-6360LV at UCN and a JEOL JSM-7001F at Technische Universit\u00e4t Bergakademie Freiberg (TU-BAF). Finally, elemental maps of different sapphire crystals and other minerals were measured using a Hitachi SU-5000 SEM with Bruker energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers (EDS) housed at Bruker Nano GmbH Berlin, Germany. All lithological units dominated by secondary mineralogical assemblages were classified using Zharikov et al. (2007) recommendations from the Subcommission on the Systematics of Metamorphic Rocks of the International Union of Geological Science (IUGS).\n\n\n3\nTectono-magmatic setting\nThe geological evolution of the Central Andes (late Devonian-present) in northern Chile can be divided into three orogenic cycles. The last episode of the Andean cycle (late early Jurassic-present) is related to the tectono-magmatic context of the study area evolution. This tectonic evolution is characterised by developing an active continental margin in the western part of South America. Under this tectonic regime, a volcano-magmatic arc and back-arc basin were developed (Coira et al., 1982; Charrier et al., 2007). In particular, between 26\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 south latitudes and from 69\u00b0 to 71\u00b0 west longitude, the plutonic activity was spatially controlled by the Atacama Fault System (AFS) under a transtensional tectonic regime, which is represented by the emplacement of several lower cretaceous plutonic bodies (Fig. 1\n), such as La Brea (123\u2013117\u00a0Ma), La Borracha (114\u2013103\u00a0Ma) and Sierra Atacama (117\u2013104\u00a0Ma) (Arabasz, 1971; Brown et al., 1993; Godoy et al., 2003; Ar\u00e9valo, 2005). The late volcanic expression (early Jurassic-late early Cretaceous) of the Andean tectonic cycle evolution is associated with intermediate volcanism, mainly represented by the La Negra volcanic and Punta del Cobre volcanic-volcanoclastic formations (Naranjo, 1978; Lara and Godoy, 1998).\n\n\n4\nRegional geology\n\n4.1\nGeological units\nThe outcrops of two main geological units can be recognised within the study area. The oldest unit corresponds to the La Negra Formation (Garc\u00eda, 1967) (Pliensbachian \u2013 lower Jurassic), a homogenous sequence of andesitic-basaltic rocks, hornfels and subordinate volcanoclastic sediments (Fig. 2\na), with an exposed thickness of 250\u00a0m in the southwestern part of the study area. However, it is estimated that the sequence can reach a maximum thickness of between\u00a0\u223c\u00a05000\u201310000\u00a0m (Su\u00e1rez et al., 1985; Buchelt, 1988). The La Negra formation is affected by mylonites related to the Atacama Fault System (AFS) activity and is intruded by Cretaceous magmatic bodies (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005).\nThe La Brea pluton (123\u2013127\u00a0Ma) is the most extensive intrusive unit within the study area (\u223c270\u00a0km2). It is elongated in the N-S direction and is mainly represented by numerous small dioritic and granodioritic outcrops (Fig. 2a) (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005). The northern limit of this pluton is controlled by the Bandurrias Fault System, which is in contact with the La Borracha pluton (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005). To the west, it is limited by the La Negra Formation, the Sierra Atacama pluton (Godoy et al., 2003), and the La Borracha Pluton (114\u2013103\u00a0Ma) (Grocott et al., 1994).\nThe La Borracha pluton is a magmatic body that is\u00a0\u223c\u00a0250\u00a0km2 in area. This magmatic body has a rhombohedral geometry and shows a north-northwest orientation. This pluton is limited by mylonites in contact with the Atacama Fault System (AFS) to the northwest (Lara and Godoy, 1998). The Bandurrias fault determines the southwest contact, which juxtaposes this pluton with the La Brea pluton (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005). The La Borracha pluton is formed by quartziferous monzodiorite and middle-fine grained quartziferous monzodiorite, with minor variations to monzogranite (Grocott et al., 1994).\nAlluvial and aeolian deposits overlap the La Negra Formation and the La Brea pluton (Fig. 2a). The alluvial deposits correspond to non-consolidated deposits of gravel and poorly classified sand, transported as gravitational and water flows, that occupy low-angle slopes and fill streams (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005). Aeolian non-consolidated sediments are dominated by quartz-feldspathic sands, formed by non-cohesive coarse to fine grains, with good textural maturity (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005).\n\n\n4.2\nStructural geology\nThe main structural feature in the study area is the Atacama Fault System (AFS), which corresponds to a trench-parallel N-S sinistral strike-slip fault system (Arabasz, 1971; Brown et al., 1993). It is a major structural system with at least 1000\u00a0km extension within the Cordillera de la Costa of the Central Andes, approximately from 20\u00b0S to 29\u00b0S, and is represented by sub-vertical structures. Its history dates back to the Mesozoic, with intermittent and overlapping faults that define the AFS strike subparallel to the continental margin (Arabasz, 1971; Brown et al., 1993). The sinistral strike-slip faults from the AFS with ductile and brittle conditions cut several volcanic and plutonic rocks younger than\u00a0\u223c\u00a0130\u00a0Ma, forming a belt of ductile mylonitic rocks up to 1\u00a0km wide, under green-schist to amphibolite metamorphic facies (Grocott et al., 1994). The AFS cuts the lower Cretaceous intrusive units and Jurassic volcanic-continental sequences (e.g., the La Brea pluton and the La Negra Formation, respectively) (Fig. 1) (Ar\u00e9valo, 2005).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nPetrography of corundum-related lithological units\nBased on geological mapping, light microscopy, and XRD analysis, eight main lithological units with their respective mineralogical assemblages have been defined (Table 1\n) within the study area, which displays a direct spatial link with the sapphire-rich zones: (i) quartzite, (ii) diorite, (iii) hydrothermal breccia, (iv) sapphirite, (v) diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite, (vi) sapphire-dravite metasomatite, (vii) tourmalinite, and (viii) b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire metasomatite (see supplementary data 1 to 6 and 8 to 10). A common mineralogical feature of most metasomatite units is the occurrence of variable proportions of sapphire as a main rock-forming component. The sapphires are characterised by several inclusions (see supplementary data 7) and colour and tone variations. In contrast, the diorite, quartzite, and tourmalinite lithological units host low sapphire concentrations, classified as an accessory phase in these rocks. The sapphire-bearing rock units are limited to a small area (\u223c1000\u00a0m2) and NNE elongated outcrops, showing straight and well-defined lithological contacts with the local surrounding units. However, contacts between regional units and sapphire-bearing rocks are not visible within the study area. It is essential to highlight that all the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas area units are almost entirely covered by Quaternary non-consolidated aeolian sediments (Fig. 2).\n\n5.1.1\nQuartzite\nThe quartzite bodies are spatially restricted to the boundaries between sapphire-bearing rocks and dioritic intrusives, showing an irregular and discontinuous contact with the dioritic intrusive (Fig. 2a-b). This lithological unit displays a distinctive granoblastic texture and is composed of\u00a0\u223c\u00a090\u00a0vol% of quartz crystals of\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.05\u00a0mm, \u223c4\u00a0vol%. of subhedral sillimanite (fibrolite type) and\u00a0\u223c\u00a04 % vol. of anhedral sericite. Rutile, sapphire and apatite also occur as accessory minerals, representing less than\u00a0\u223c\u00a02% vol. of this unit.\n\n\n5.1.2\nDiorite\nDiorite is the most extensive lithological unit in the study area, with small outcrops surrounding the sapphire-bearing rock units (Fig. 2). Petrographically, these rocks show a very distinctive porphyritic texture and are mainly composed of\u00a0\u223c\u00a060\u00a0vol% of zoned and twinned plagioclase crystals with a size range of 0.4 to 0.8\u00a0mm and\u00a0\u223c\u00a05\u00a0vol% of biotite with sizes from 0.4 to 0.6\u00a0mm. The groundmass represents\u00a0\u223c\u00a035\u00a0vol% of these rocks and is dominated by fine-grained microlite plagioclase crystals of 0.03\u00a0mm. Additionally, \u223c3\u00a0vol% of acicular and radial crystals of sillimanite and\u00a0\u223c\u00a02\u00a0vol% of opaque minerals with a size of\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.2\u00a0mm were also observed. This unit shows locally siliceous variations.\n\n\n5.1.3\nHydrothermal breccia\nThe hydrothermal breccia is associated with multiple small outcrops (\u223c106\u00a0m2), where some of these are in contact with sapphirite (Fig. 2b). This unit comprises quartzite clasts (\u223c70\u00a0vol%) with a size ranging from 2 to 15\u00a0mm. The clasts are immersed in a granoblastic groundmass of quartz with sizes from 0.02 to 0.05\u00a0mm and jarosite with a size of 0.02\u00a0mm.\n\n\n5.1.4\nSapphirite (Corundite Sapphire-type)\nThis lithological unit corresponds to a single small outcrop (\u223c30\u00a0m2) located in the central part of the study area (Fig. 3\na-d). Petrographically, this rock type shows a typical granoblastic texture and is composed by\u00a0>\u00a090\u00a0vol% of sapphire crystals, ranging in size from 0.19 to 1.4\u00a0mm, displaying tabular and granular shapes (Fig. 3c-d). Also, subordinate amounts of anhedral dravite and diaspore can be observed in interstitial spaces between the sapphire crystals (Fig. 3d), with rutile as an accessory mineral (Fig. 3c). A very distinctive aspect of this unit is the occurrence of irregular, discontinuous, and centimetre size multi-coloured (blue, dark blue, light blue, and transparent) zones composed of sapphires (Fig. 3a-b).\n\n\n5.1.5\nDiaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite (diasporite)\nThis lithological unit is represented by a single small outcrop (\u223c44\u00a0m2) located between sapphirite and sapphire-dravite metasomatite lithological units (Fig. 2b). It displays granoblastic, poiquiloblastic and acicular textures and is composed of\u00a0\u223c\u00a080\u00a0vol% of acicular subhedral diaspore (0.09\u00a0mm to 1.6\u00a0mm in size), \u223c16\u00a0vol% of granoblastic dravite with sizes ranging from 0.15 to 3.8\u00a0mm, and\u00a0\u223c\u00a04\u00a0vol% of poiquiloblastic sapphire crystals generally measuring 0.1\u00a0mm in size (Fig. 3e-g). Subordinate amounts of secondary calcite occur as micro-veinlets that cut the diaspore-dravite-sapphire rich zones.\n\n\n5.1.6\nSapphire-dravite metasomatite\nThis lithological unit corresponds to a single small outcrop (\u223c48\u00a0m2), which is in contact with the diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite and tourmalinite lithological units (Fig. 2b). These rocks show a granoblastic texture, which is dominated by similar proportions of sapphire and dravite crystals. The sapphire and dravite crystals have sizes ranging from 0.03 to 2.2\u00a0mm and 0.1 to 1.6\u00a0mm, respectively (Fig. 3h-j). The sapphires commonly display corroded boundaries and colour zonation, from a colourless centre to a blue external zone, whereas dravite crystals show growing zonation with pale green pleochroism (Fig. 3i).\n\n\n5.1.7\nTourmalinite\nTourmaline-rich rocks are represented by a single small outcrop (\u223c76\u00a0m2), which can be correlated to the tourmaline alteration zones previously described by Garc\u00eda (1967) at the La Negra Formation (Fig. 2b). This unit is composed of anhedral to subhedral dravite, olenite and magnesiofoitite tourmaline crystals (>90\u00a0vol%) and calcite-clay-bearing groundmass (Fig. 4\na-c). The high concentration of tourmaline has a direct spatial relationship with the hydrothermal breccia zones. The tourmaline crystals range in size between 0.2 and 0.7\u00a0mm, displaying zonation and are commonly fractured (Fig. 4c). In some cases, it is also possible to find prismatic tourmaline crystals and titanite and apatite as accessories phases (Fig. 4b).\n\n\n5.1.8\nB\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire metasomatite\nThe b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire metasomatite correspond to two outcrops (\u223c565\u00a0m2 in total). This lithological unit has a direct spatial relationship with the AFS and is located at the northern part of the sapphire-bearing rocks (Fig. 2b) and is characterised by sapphire crystals that display fractures and rounded edges within a b\u00f6hmite-alunite matrix. Two sub-units can be defined, considering the colour of the groundmass, amount, size, and colour of the sapphire crystals. The first sub-unit is related to red b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire-bearing rock and is composed of\u00a0\u223c\u00a070\u00a0vol% of sapphire crystals with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 2.6\u00a0mm and\u00a0\u223c\u00a030\u00a0vol% of anhedral massive b\u00f6hmite-alunite groundmass, measuring\u00a0\u223c\u00a00,1 mm (Fig. 4d-j). The sapphire crystals display a well-defined millimetric colour zonation that varies from dark blue, blue, light blue to colourless, whereas the matrix is commonly red because of the iron content (Fig. 4d-g). The second sub-unit is associated with white sapphire-alunite-b\u00f6hmite-bearing rocks, which are composed of\u00a0\u223c\u00a090\u00a0vol% of anhedral massive b\u00f6hmite-alunite groundmass with sizes\u00a0\u223c\u00a00,1 mm and\u00a0\u223c\u00a010\u00a0vol% of sapphire crystals with a range of sizes from 0.05 to 1.0\u00a0mm. The sapphire crystals are commonly blue, light blue and colourless (Fig. 4h-j). It should be noted that these sub-units display a radial aggregate of andalusite type bow-tie ranging from 0.1 to 0.3\u00a0mm and euhedral solid inclusions of andalusite crystals within the sapphires (see supplementary data 7).\n\n\n\n5.2\nHigh-resolution mineralogical and microtextural study by automated mineralogy and SEM-EDS\nAutomated mineralogical studies and SEM-EDS analyses reveal high-resolution micrometre scale information about the spatial distribution, microtextural relationships and semi-quantitative chemical composition of the different mineralogical assemblages previously recognised by the binocular lens and light microscope. Both types of analyses were carried out on representative samples from the following units: sapphirite, diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite, b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire metasomatite, tourmalinite and quartzite.\nFalse colour composite images confirm that sapphirite is mainly comprised of sapphire (Fig. 5\na-b), showing lower amounts of diaspore, which occurs at the sapphire crystals' edges. Scarce tourmaline crystals fill interstitial spaces between the sapphire-diaspore association, whereas sericite displays microtextural intergrowth with clays (Fig. 5a). Images also show that some tourmaline crystals are intensely replaced by clays. Additionally, Al and Si elemental composition images (Fig. 5c-d) are consistent with the occurrence and the spatial distribution of all previously recognised mineral phases. This unit also has interstitial accessory rutile.\nIn the diasporite, results show an intense overprinting relationship between various mineralogical phases, which allow reconstructing the order of crystallisation (Fig. 6\na-d). In this unit, the lower concentration of sapphire relative to sapphirite is notable (Fig. 6a), where an intense diaspore replacement on the edges of sapphire crystals occurred. Most of the diaspore crystals are large (>500\u00a0\u03bcm), euhedral and fibrous (Fig. 6b-c). The dravite crystals are also euhedral and cut the sapphire-diaspore association. In addition, sharp contacts between these mineral phases can be observed (Fig. 6a). Microtextural relationships indicate that calcite fills an intense fracture network that cuts both the sapphire-diaspore association and the dravite crystals (Fig. 6d). Elemental maps of Al, Fe, Ca and Si, are consistent with the occurrence and distribution of all mineralogical assemblages previously described.\nFalse colour composite images in the b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire metasomatite show that this unit is dominated by a fine-grained alunite-b\u00f6hmite matrix and rounded or sharp sapphire crystals, whereas calcite is restricted to specific zones (Fig. 7\na-b). Images reveal that sapphire crystals are strongly corroded and replaced by b\u00f6hmite, whereas alunite occurs in interstitial spaces between sapphire and b\u00f6hmite associations (Fig. 7b). Finally, the calcite-clay association cuts all previously described mineral assemblages. The spatial distribution of Al (Fig. 7c) agrees with the occurrence of b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire association, whereas Si-rich zones confirm the presence of clays (Fig. 7d).\nImages of dravite-sapphire metasomatite indicate that dravite is the dominant mineral phase between euhedral tabular sapphire crystals (Fig. 8\na). Sapphire is locally replaced by a fine-grained diaspore (Fig. 8a). Elemental distribution images of Si (Fig. 8b) and Al (Fig. 8c) display a clear correlation with dravite and sapphire, respectively. These correlations are confirmed with the elemental intensity percentage distribution maps, where the high intensity of Al is in agreement with the sapphire-diaspore association, showing green shades, whereas, in contrast, the lower intensity of Al is consistent with dravite, displaying blue shades (Fig. 8d). The Si distribution is consistent with the occurrence of dravite, showing green shades (\u223c40\u201350%) (Fig. 8e).\nIt is essential to highlight the notable colour zonation displayed by sapphire crystals from most lithological units. Elemental maps demonstrate that this zonation is strongly correlated to distribution and variable concentrations of Fe that have replaced the Al within these crystals (Fig. 9\na-d).\nComposite images of tourmalinite indicate that this unit is almost entirely composed of tourmaline fragments immersed in a calcite-rich matrix (Fig. 10\na-d). Accessory apatite and quartz also occur within the matrix. Elemental distribution maps of Al-Si (Fig. 10b-c) are consistent with tourmaline, whereas high Ca is consistent with calcite distribution. (Fig. 10d).\nAs expected, composite and elemental images indicate that fine-grained anhedral quartz is the main mineralogical phase in the quartzite unit (Fig. 10e-h), whereas moderate amounts of interstitial sillimanite and sapphire occur spatially associated with b\u00f6hmite and sericite (Fig. 10e). The distribution of Al and Si is compatible with the occurrence of all mineral phases (Fig. 10f-g), whereas the absence of Ca is consistent with the lack of calcite (Fig. 10h).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nBased on mineralogical and textural features, rock units at the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas can be genetically grouped into two main geological domains. The southwestern domain comprises the lithological units showing slight to absent alteration (sapphirite and quartzite), being their main mineral paragenesis sapphire, sillimanite, andalusite and quartz. Otherwise, from the centre to the northeastern domain, the lithological units show moderate to intense alterations (diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite, sapphire-dravite metasomatite, tourmalinite and b\u00f6hmite-alunite-sapphire metasomatite) wherein the prograde minerals have been intensely overprinted by retrograde mineral assemblages, such as diaspore, b\u00f6hmite and alunite related to advanced argillic alteration. The boundary between both domains is sharp and can be explained by an ENE normal fault related to the AFS, directly linked to the tourmaline presence. It is proposed that this structure brought together the shallow retrograde and the deep prograde zones (Fig. 14).\n\n6.1\nTemporality and formation conditions of metasomatic mineralogical assemblages\nThe observed microtextural relationships between the different metasomatic mineralogical assemblages provide direct petrographic evidence about the relative temporality of mineral formation within sapphire-related lithological units at the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas deposit, which is in agreement with their theoretical formation conditions. All mineralogical associations alter sapphire crystals edges or fill interstitial spaces and fracture networks between and across them, and therefore, it is possible to determine that the sapphire crystallisation represents the earliest metasomatic event within the deposit. This mineralogical phase usually forms at temperatures above 450\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C (Laubengayer and Weisz, 1943).\nThe sapphire crystals in this deposit are blue, light blue, dark blue, and colourless. The cause of the sapphire\u02c8 colours has been extensively described and can be explained when a variable and minor (trace) amounts of Fe2+, Fe3+, and Ti4+ replace the Al in the crystal structure (Ferguson and Fielding, 1971; Nikolskaya et al., 1978; Fritsch and Rossman, 1988; Hughes et al., 2017; Voudouris, 2019), as well as, the colourless sapphire is related to pure corundum (Hughes et al., 2017; Pratt, 1906).\nThe sapphires from the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas display a correlation between size and colour, where the big crystals are blue and dark blue, whereas the smaller crystals are light blue and colourless. Some sapphire crystals show systematic colour oscillation and zonation, which could be explained by different redox conditions and variations of Fe (or Ti) concentrations during the metasomatic formation processes of sapphire-bearing rocks (Nikolskaya et al., 1978) (Fig. 11\n).\nIt should be noted that quartz and sapphire in quartzites are not in contact due to the presence of sillimanite and sericite between them (Fig. 10e). The acicular sillimanite (fibrolite) is restricted to the contact zone between the La Brea diorite, the quartzite, and the hydrothermal breccias. In contrast, andalusite was identified as radial aggregates type bow-tie (Berg and Tidy, 2009) and solid inclusions within sapphires. The presence of sillimanite near the intrusive contact and andalusite in sapphire-bearing rocks can be interpreted as a stable\/metastable assemblage at moderate to high temperatures conditions (Guiraud et al., 1996; Motoyoshi et al., 1990; Simonet et al., 2008) due to differences in proximity to the intrusive or the fluids that provide the temperature. Theoretical formation conditions of sillimanite, andalusite and sapphire and their spatial distribution within the deposit suggest that these mineralogical phases were contemporaneously formed; however, high temperatures above 650\u00a0\u00b0C and Si availability promote the selective sillimanite crystallisation, which changes to andalusite when the temperature drops below 650\u00a0\u00b0C, while sapphire remains stable up to 450\u00a0\u00b0C (Laubengayer and Weisz, 1945). The formation of andalusite\/sillimanite is conditioned by the interaction of corundum with silica (Schreyer, 1987).\nDiaspore occurrence is restricted to the diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite, although minor amounts of this mineral are also hosted by the sapphirite and sapphire-dravite-metasomatite. Diaspore alters the edges of sapphire crystals within these units, suggesting that diaspore was formed later than sapphire. This evidence agrees with previous experimental works that confirm the stability of diaspore below 450\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C in hydrothermal environments (Laubengayer and Weisz, 1943). Further experiments indicate that diaspore forms at temperatures lower than 380\u00a0\u00b0C in alkaline solutions (Gout and Verdes, 1993). In particular, the epitaxial growth of diaspore on corundum is observed in diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite (Fig. 6d), a crystallographic phenomenon that has been experimentally verified at 390\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.5 kbar (Hass, 1972).\nAt low temperature and pressure conditions, the substitution of Al by Fe within the diaspore lattice is necessary to stabilise it (Gout and Verdes, 1993). The low Fe concentration detected within diaspore crystals can confirm its stability as an alteration product in the diaspore-dravite-sapphire metasomatite (Fig. 6c). Euhedral dravite fills large spaces between the sapphire-diaspore association (Fig. 6a), suggesting a later introduction of dravite relative to them. The formation of diaspore as a corundum alteration product (diasporisation) has also been documented in other deposits (e.g. Naxos, Greece), which consists of the hydration of corundum due to the fluid\/rock interaction (Feenstra, 1985; Markl and Scharlau, 2008; Feenstra and Wunder, 2002; Voudouris et al., 2019).\nMost b\u00f6hmite occurs on sapphire crystals corroded edges (Fig. 7a-c), whereas minor amounts fill interstitial spaces between quartz and sillimanite (Fig. 10e), suggesting a later formation of b\u00f6hmite relative to sapphire, quartz and sillimanite. B\u00f6hmite is stable between 155\u00a0\u00b0C and 280\u00a0\u00b0C (Laubengayer and Weisz, 1943), which indicates that cooling of the system was required to stabilise them, whilst corrosion of sapphire (Fig. 7b) indicate that this mineral phase experienced dissolution processes before b\u00f6hmite formation. Additionally, alunite fills interstitial spaces between the sapphire-b\u00f6hmite crystals (Fig. 7b), implying that this mineral represents one of the latest alteration events within the deposit.\nIn metamorphic environments, the alunite needs a source of peraluminous rocks (Dill, 2001) and acidic fluids (pH\u00a0<\u00a04.5) to form during retrograde metamorphism. (Ek and Nystenm 1990). Experimental studies have shown that alunite is formed in a metamorphic environment up to about 400\u00a0\u00b0C at 1 kbar (Hemley et al., 1969; Schreyer, 1987; Dill, 2001) and is also formed as a product of volcanic rocks alteration by interacting with hydrothermal sulfuric acid solutions (H\u00f6ller, 1967). It should be noted that the alunite can be transformed in corundum\u00a0+\u00a0fluid systems during regional metamorphism (Schreyer, 1987; Dill, 2001), allowing the presence of alunite as a corundum alteration product. Finally, calcite fills interstitial spaces (Fig. 7a-b) and fracture networks (Fig. 6) and cut all mineralogical phases in most of the lithological units, confirming that this phase corresponds to the latest event within the deposit (Fig. 12\n).\n\n\n6.2\nOrigin and genetic model of the deposit\nThe Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas area is dominated by Early Cretaceous intrusives such as the La Brea and the La Borracha plutons. These magmatic bodies experienced rapid cooling due to the shallow depths of emplacements across the wide Mesozoic arcs (Dallmeyer et al., 1996). It has been determined by the Al-in-hornblende barometer that the emplacement pressure was ca. 2.0 and ca. 1.9 kbar for the La Borracha Pluton (Dallmeyer et al., 1996), inferring depths of around 7 to 8\u00a0km. These Early Cretaceous intrusives' deep emplacement and regional extension are linked to the extensional regime triggered by retreating subduction in the Andean plate boundary before c. 127\u00a0Ma (Dallmeyer et al., 1996) correlates with Mesozoic subduction-related extensional tectonics (Moreno and Gibbons, 2017). In the southwest part of the area, the volcanic La Negra Formation comes into contact with the Cretaceous intrusives through the AFS, so there is a possibility that some basaltic level of the La Negra Formation may be the protolith.\nTo promote the metasomatic formation of sapphire-bearing rocks, it is necessary to produce a desilication process, a phenomenon that has been previously described in other metasomatic sapphire-bearing rocks. This phenomenon has been described as silica being \u201cpumped out\u201d from the silica-aluminous unit to the silica-deficient unit, wherein other elements, such as Al and Fe, are less mobile than Si and can remain in the protolith promoting the crystallisation of sapphires (Brandt, 1946; Grapes and Palmer, 1996; Simonet et al., 2000, 2004, 2008; Giuliani et al., 2014; Pohl et al., 1980).\nIn the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas case, the high-temperature contact metasomatism produced by the Cretaceous intrusives or fluids (silica- and alumina-rich component) into the Jurassic basaltic rocks (silica-deficient component) could have led to an extreme desilication, wherein Si migrates from the intrusive contacts into the basalts, allowing the relative enrichment of Al with traces of Fe and Ti in the intrusive boundary. These elements are less mobile, promote corundum formation, and allow the formation of sapphires with different colours and shades. The presence of several solid and fluid inclusions within the sapphires confirms the metasomatic influence in this deposit formation (see supplementary data 7).\nConsidering the mobility of the Al in the mantle and crust, this element is not fractionated either by the oceanic crust or by the lower and upper continental crust, as well as the Al2O3 percentage contributed by different minerals in basalts and granodiorites is around 15.7% and 15% respectively (Favero and Jobstraibizer, 1996). Accordingly, it can be deduced that the intensity of the desilication phenomenon influenced by the AFS should be more important than the initial Al concentration in the host rocks.\nThe conditions of the extreme desilication metasomatism are related to the solubility of elements. The solubility of Si at pressures around 2 kbar is mainly influenced by temperature increases and not by changes in pressure (Monecke et al., 2018), allowing Si mobility and subsequent precipitation due to the decrease of temperature, forming quartzites in the boundaries of the sapphire-bearing rocks (Fig. 13\n). As is generally the case, \u201cblack walls\u201d should be formed between metasomatic units and the protolith, but in this case, these contacts are not clear on the surface due to the occurrence of non-consolidated Quaternary sediments (dune fields).\nAfter the sapphire-bearing rock formation, an ENE normal geological fault (AFS) facilitates the circulation of later hydrothermal fluids, altering the sapphires to b\u00f6hmite and diaspore in the shallow and deep zones. It should be noted that the presence of alunite is directly related to corundum alteration under acid fluid conditions at temperatures below 400\u00a0\u00b0C, and the tourmalines have a close spatial relationship with the faults that supplies the metasomatic fluids and cross the deposit. The formation of these late hydrothermal assemblages can be interpreted as an overprinting of a retrograde metasomatic system (Fig. 14\n). The lack of gibbsite suggests the absence of low-temperature hydrothermal and supergene processes during the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas deposit formation.\n\n\n6.3\nDeposit classification\nMany classifications have been proposed to understand the origin, geological and geochemical context of different corundum deposits worldwide. Some classifications considered the geological context of the deposits (igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic environments); the nature of the corundum host rocks and petrographic characteristics (Schwarz, 1998; Garnier et al., 2004; Walton, 2004; Giuliani et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2017); genetic processes responsible for corundum formation (Simonet, 2000; Kievlenko, 2003; Simonet et al., 2008); oxygen isotope compositions in rubies and sapphires as an origin tracer (Giuliani et al., 2005); geochemistry of trace elements (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ga) in corundum crystals (Chulapakorn et al., 2014) and the gallium (Ga)\/ magnesium (Mg) ratio to differentiate between metamorphic and igneous sapphires (Peucat et al., 2007). According to the results obtained in this study, we considered the criteria of Simonet et al. (2008) to classify the sapphire-rich rocks from the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas area. In this sense, the geological evidence of the sapphire-bearing rocks suggests that this deposit corresponds to a primary metamorphic, metasomatic sub-type, mainly due to the spatial distribution of the lithological units, contacts, metamorphic textures and prograde\/retrograde mineral associations. The sapphire-bearing rocks at the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas represent a new and exceptional metasomatic sapphire deposit formed by an extreme desilication process between Cretaceous granodioritic intrusives and the La Negra Formation across the Atacama Fault System.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas deposit consists of various small outcrops of well-zoned rock units (\u223c1000\u00a0m2), which host variable amounts of sapphires. The highest sapphire concentrations (\u223c90\u00a0vol%) are hosted by the sapphirite unit, where the crystals are blue, dark-blue, light-blue and colourless. Geological and mineralogical evidence indicates that the origin of the sapphirites is related to an extreme desilication process promoted by moderate- to high-temperature at\u00a0\u223c\u00a02 Kbar pressure prograde metasomatism developed between Aptian granodioritic bodies, basalts from the La Negra Formation and fluids channelled by the AFS.\nThe occurrence of diaspore, b\u00f6hmite and alunite is associated with subsequent retrograde metasomatism (alteration process) of early sapphire. In contrast, precipitation of dravite and other tourmaline species is linked to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids controlled by ENE faults, genetically correlated to the AFS.\nThe sapphire-bearing rocks at the Portezuelo de Pajas Blancas area can be classified as a primary metamorphic deposit, metasomatic sub-type, sapphire-rich metasomatite (sapphirites). It should be noted that the AFS controlled the origin of this deposit during a tectono-magmatic subduction setting. The genetic model proposed in this work could be used to explore corundum-bearing rocks in the Central Andes.\n\n","57":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMapping of geochemical anomaly is greatly importance in the field of environmental assessment and mineral exploration, which aims to delineate the interested area related to contamination and mineralization. Regional geochemistry data is a commonly used in mineral and environmental investigation since it can quickly determine the distribution and range of the target area. The mineralization anomalies are results of multiple geological processes (e.g., geological structures, formation and rocks). The role of geological factors has long been recognized, which exert a significant influence and even dominant control on the formation and distribution of geochemical anomaly at large spatial scales. Therefore, constraints of geological information are vital to provide some insights into the distributions of geochemical anomalies. Geological factors have important implications for the delineation and interpretation of geochemical anomalies. Incorporation of the auxiliary geological factors into the anomaly identification process can improve the efficiency for mineral exploration. Some environmental factors, including catchment basin and topography factors, have been involved the process of anomaly identification of stream sediments (e.g., Spadoni, 2006; Carranza, 2010; Farahbakhsh et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021a, Zhang et al., 2021b). To get a reasonable and reliable result, various researchers have also incorporated geological constraints into geophysics inversions and 3D modelling for reducing uncertainty (e.g., Veeken and Da Silva, 2004; Leli\u00e8vre et al., 2009; Jessell et al., 2010; Gelderblom and Leguijt, 2010; Zhao et al., 2017; Khalajmasoumi et al., 2017, Lipari et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Eldosouky et al., 2021; Hajnajafi et al., 2021; Heidari et al., 2021; Parsa and Pour, 2021; Shamseddin Meigooni et al., 2021a, 2021b; Sadeghi and Cohen, 2021; Sadeghi, 2021). However, few research has integrated geological constraints into the geochemical anomaly identification model to obtain more reliable high potential areas for further mineral exploration.\nIn order to obtain highly accurate predictions, integration of some complimentary types of geological data based on previous geological knowledge is essential. Furthermore, reliable geochemical evidential maps contribute to delineate more accurate and credible target areas for mineral potential mapping (Carranza, 2008; Yousefi et al., 2012; Afzal et al., 2019). With acknowledgement of the importance of geochemical maps, the challenge is how to generate a reliable geochemical map. Some literatures have focused on the development of new methods for generating the enhanced geochemical evidential maps, such as singularity index analysis, geochemical mineralization probability index and staged factor analysis (e.g., Cheng, 1999; Yousefi et al., 2012, Yousefi et al., 2013; Afzal et al., 2019; Shahbazi et al., 2021; Sadeghi et al., 2016a, 2016b; Sadeghi et al., 2021). Many researchers have proposed some integrated frameworks for incorporating different types of geological information into the process of mineral prediction (e.g., Agterberg et al., 1993; Cheng and Agterberg, 1999; Noorollahi et al., 2008; Nazelle et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011a; Wang et al., 2011b; Abedi and Norouzi, 2012; Momeni et al., 2014; Chen, 2015; Fabija\u0144czyk et al., 2016; Sabbaghi and Tabatabaei, 2020; Wang and Zuo, 2020). However, few studies have been reported that integration of geological constraints were acted as secondary data for acquiring the enhanced geochemical anomaly maps.\nSome geostatisticians have proposed some methods for integrating multi-source geoscience data, such as co-kriging and probability kriging (Hirsche et al., 1997). In recent years, many machine learning methods were commonly employed to exploit these different types of geoscience data, capturing the relationship and inherent structure in a dataset (Bergen et al., 2019). For instance, neural network classifiers were employed to integrate various geophysical data with geological and geochemical data to determine additional drilling for copper exploration (e.g., Brown et al., 2000; Abedi and Norouzi, 2012). Random forest was used to fuse categorical and continuous data for generating a robust mineral potential maps (e.g., Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2014; Carranza and Laborte, 2015a, 2015b; McKay and Harris, 2016). Support vector machines and restricted Boltzmann machine was used to produce mineral potential mapping (e.g., Zuo and Carranza, 2011; Chen, 2015). The problems of black boxes and complexities of some machine learning algorithms make the results difficult to interpret (Bergen et al., 2019; Zuo, 2020). The spatiotemporal bayesian maximum entropy (BME) mapping method provides a feasible framework for integrating various different types of spatiotemporal data in a mathematically rigorous and interpretively meaningful manner, which has been shown to produce more accurate mapping results in geoscience than those from the linear kriging family of traditional geostatistics (e.g., Christakos, 1990, 1992; D'Or, 2003; Yanosky et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009; Bogaert et al., 2009; Nazelle et al., 2010; Akita et al., 2012; Allard et al., 2012; Reyes and Serre, 2014; Bottaro et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021).\nThe available geological information can be categorized into located (spatially tied) and non-located (Sams et al., 2011). We are mainly focused on located information including formation, faults and granites in this study, which is linked with a complex geological environment. In order to extract useful geological constraints data from the high level of redundancy data, it is important to establish a right model for quantifying these different types of geological information. Xiao et al. (2008) first proposed the combination of BME and GWR for improving the prediction accuracy of the PM2.5 concentrations. The objective of the study is to introduce a new model of geochemical anomaly identification that combines BME and GWR, which has rigorous mathematicalfoundation for integrating multi-sources and multi-types spatial data. In this paper, we outline some available geological constraints (i.e., Acidic magmatic rock of Yanshanian, NE linear structure, Archean metamorphic rock, and Intersection of linear structures) that were incorporated into the constructed geochemical anomaly identification framework. The geochemical anomalies related to Mo mineralization was identified, and compared with the results obtained from GWR and ordinary kriging, which validated the feasibility and validity of BME-GWR model. We demonstrate the mathematical formalization of the geological constraints by combined methods of GWR and GIS, which preserves local features as soon as possible. Then, we illustrate how to integrate geological information into the enhanced geochemical anomaly framework using BME function.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\n\n2.1\nGeological setting\nThe study area is one of the most important Molybdenum polymetallic metallogenic belt, which has experienced bursts of basalt in the Cenozoic. The geotectonic location of the study area is very unique, and located in north margin of the North China craton (Fig. 1\na). The north is separated by the eastern Chinese extension of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt and Yinshan fault-uplift zone (Fig. 1b; Yu et al., 2008). The south is situated next to the Cenozoic Daihai-Huangqihai fault basin, which controls the development of regional geological and mineralization (Wu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2005). The study area is bounded by the Trans-north China Orogen in the east (Wang et al., 2017). The oldest basement rocks in the Jining region are Archaean to Proterozoic metamorphic rock (e.g., gneiss and granulite), which is overlain by basalt and near surface sedimentary layers. The stratigraphy consists of Archean to Cenozoic formation (Fig. 1b, 1c), including carbonate rock of Ordovician, sandstone and shale of Cambrianand Jurassic and Hannobar basalt of Neogene (Zhang et al., 2018). The fault widely developed in the study area, and structure direction is mainly along NE, NW and E-W directions. The NE Datong-Shangyi fault and secondary faults are mainly ore-controlling structure (Li et al., 2012). The volcanic activities mainly occurred in the Paleozoic, Jurassic-Cretaceous and Neogene. The intrusive rocks are widely distributed in the form of batholith, branch and dike in the study area, including granides and dioritiods of Meso-Neoarchean, Varician, Indosinian and Yanshanian (e.g., tonalite, monzogranite and granodiorite; Zhang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021).\nIn the past two decades, several porphyry molybdenum deposits have been discovered in this area, which is mainly formed in Mesozoic period. Some previous comprehensive studies have been implemented on deposit genesis, fluid inclusions, isotopic ages and mineral prospecting in this study area (e.g., Zhang et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Nie et al., 2012; Nie et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a, Zhang et al., 2021b; Wu et al., 2021; Shu and Chiaradia, 2021). Research indicated that the distribution of the discovered deposits is closely related to the fault structures (NE direction), Mesozoic intermediate-acid intrusions and Archean metamorphic rocks. The discovered Quanzigou, Caosiyao and Dasuji molybdenum deposits are large and superlarge deposits in this area, which are located in the surrounding the Lianglong fault zone. Re-Os isotopic dating for molybdenite from Caosiyao, Dasuji and Quanzigou molybdenum deposits are 130.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0Ma, 222.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma and 161.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0Ma, respectively, indicating that at least three epochs of mineralization process (Zhang et al., 2009; Nie et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018).\n\n\n2.2\nMolybdenum mineralization\nFor Caosiyao Mo deposit, the wall-rock alteration is mainly of silicification, sericitization, chloritization, and kaolinization, especially, silicification is closely related to molybdenum mineralization. The scope of hydrothermal alteration is widespread and high strength, which shows the inconspicuous zonation outwards from orebody center. The molybdenum mineralization zone appears the asymmetrical Dumb-bell from the flat surface. The Molybdenum mineralization mainly occurs in the Archean metamorphic rocks and the Mesozoic quartz porphyry, syenite porphyry and granitic porphyry in forms of dissemination, reticulation and vein (Fig. 2\na, 2b, 2\u00a0g and 2\u00a0h; Nie et al., 2012).\nIn Dasuji Mo deposit, the alteration is well developed in wall-rock. The sulfide minerals include molybdenite, pyrite, wolframite, magnetite, sphalerite, galena, and etc. The oxidized minerals are composed of molybdenite, limonite, pyrolusite, and etc. Gangue minerals are primarily quartz, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, kaolinite, sericite, and epidote. The syenite granite (porphyry) characterized by small rock stub intrudes quartz porphyry in central ore district, and causes quartz porphyry fragmentation, which is one of the ore-bearing masses. The main minerals consist of potassium feldspar, quartz, molybdenite, and pyrite (Fig. 2c, 2e, 2f). In the veined syenogranite, the molybdenite is located in the outside of the massive quartz (Fig, 2d). The formation of Dasuji deposit can be divided into four stages based on the geology and cross-cutting relationships, which is characterized K-feldspathization with minor molybdenum mineralization, the molybdenum mineralization accompanied by sericitization and silicification (Fig. 2i), lead\u2013zinc mineralization associating with carbonatization and fluorination (Fig. 2j), and no mineralization, respectively (Chen et al., 2019a; 2019b).\n\n\n2.3\nGeochemical dataset\nStream sediment data can direct access to interested mineralization information, which is considered to be the primary data for geochemical anomaly identification in large scale. In this study, stream sediment samples at scale of 1: 20 0000 were collected from China Geological Survey and analyzed 39 elements for each sample (Fig. 3\na; Table 1\n). The sampling density is sparse in southeast part of this study area, even missing data. Every sample is composed of mixed four samples acquired from the grid 2\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0km, which represent the geochemical nature of the region. The standard reference samples were used to reduce the inter-laboratory and within-laboratory bias and monitor data quality during sample analysis. You can see more details about sampling process, sample preparation, analysis techniques and data quality monitoring in Xie et al. (2008) and Wang et al. (2011).\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nData preprocessing\nThe stream sediment data was first transformed to Euclidean space for reducing closure effects using centered log-ratio (clr) transformation (more details about the closure effects and logtatio transformations can see Aitchison,1986; Filzmoser et al., 2009, 2010; Zuo et al., 2013; Sauro Graziano et al., 2020; Sahoo et al., 2020; Tepanosyan et al., 1987). Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) was used to reduce dimension for clr-transformed geochemical dataset, and derived the geochemical composition features using the parts of original variables (cf. Erichson et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021a; Wang et al., 2021b). These data processing was carried out by R language packages of robCompositions and sparsepca. The lodgings of Bi-Mo-W on the fifth sparse principal component (SPC5) based on clr-transformed data is positive, indicating the primary elemental associations of Mo polymetallic mineralization. Consequently, SPC5 was selected to further investigate the effects of geological constraints. The scores of SPC5 was interpolated by ordinary kriging (Fig. 3b), which showed the apparent different with the spatial distribution of Mo concentrations (Fig. 3a). Therefore, the spatial distribution of positive scores suggested the spatial distribution of Mo polymetallic mineralization.\n\n\n3.2\nGWR method\nThe GWR is an extension of ordinary linear regression model, which can be used to investigate spatial heterogeneity using spatial local regression (Fotheringham et al., 1998). The local regression model was established by the moving window approach, where the observations are weighted that within the region based on the distance from regression point. The GWR model generates the spatial local variance for each regression point, which can be used to evaluate the influence of independent variables on dependent variables. The general local linear equation can be written\n\n\n\n\nP\ni\n\n=\n\n\u03b2\n0\n\n+\n\n\u2211\nk\n\n\n\u03b2\nk\n\n\nx\n\nik\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\ni\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03b2\nk\n\n\n and \n\n\nx\n\nik\n\n\n\n are the regression coefficient and the kth geological constraints variables of sample point i, respectively. \n\n\n\u03b5\ni\n\n\n is the random error. The GWR model was established in this study,\n\n\n\n\np\ni\n\n\u223d\nM\ni\nd\n-\nA\nc\ni\nd\ni\nc\nm\na\ng\nm\na\nt\ni\nc\nr\no\nc\nk\no\nf\nY\na\nn\ns\nh\na\nn\np\ne\nr\ni\no\nd\n+\nN\nE\nl\ni\nn\ne\na\nr\ns\nt\nr\nu\nc\nt\nu\nr\ne\n+\nA\nr\nc\nh\ne\na\nn\nm\ne\nt\na\nm\no\nr\np\nh\ni\nc\nr\no\nc\nk\n+\nI\nn\nt\ne\nr\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\no\nf\nl\ni\nn\ne\na\nr\ns\nt\nr\nu\nc\nt\nu\nr\ne\ns\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\np\ni\n\n\n is the prediction value at point i. The prediction values are variation with the location changes in the light of the spatial heterogeneities of geochemical data and their geological constraints. Adaptive bandwidths based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was adopted to avoid the large variability and under-smoothness tendency of the standard Akaike Information Criterion in this study (Hurvich et al., 1998). More details on kernel type and bandwidth selection can be found in Fotheringham et al. (2003).\n\n\n3.3\nBME model\nBME was continuously developed and expanded since BME was proposed by Christakos (e.g., Christakos and Li, 1998; Serre, 1999; Serre and Christakos, 1999; Christakos and Serre, 2000; Christakos, 2000; Bogaert, 2002; Serre et al., 2003; D'Or and Bogaert, 2003; Douaik et al., 2004; Wibrin et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008; Orton and Lark, 2009; Money et al., 2009; Messier et al., 2012; Beckerman et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2020; Rezaei et al., 2020; DeLang et al., 2021). The data involved in BME analysis framework was grouped into two types of site-specific knowledge and general knowledge. The space statistical moments (mean, covariance, etc.) can characterize several random fields, which are commonly regarded as part of general knowledge base \n\nG\n\n (Serre and Christakos, 1999). Site-specific knowledge \n\nS\n\n can consists of hard data and soft data in the light of data accuracy. The hard data and soft data are represented the exact measurement data and uncertainty data (e.g., uncertain knowledge, experience, intuition, etc.), respectively. In this study, the geochemical data and geological data is only spatial data, and we define pure space random field (SRF) \n\nX\n(\n\np\n\n)\n\n. The mapping points \n\n\np\n\nmap\n\n\n\n of random variable \n\n\nx\n\nmap\n\n\n\n can berepresentedas \n\n(\n\np\n\nhard\n\n\n,\n\np\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n\n,\np\n\ni\n\n)\n\n, where \n\n\np\n\nhard\n\n\n\n, \n\n\np\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n and \n\n\np\ni\n\n\n are hard data, soft data and estimation data, respectively. The value vector of a specific realization of \n\n\nx\n\nmap\n\n\n\n is denoted \n\n\n\u03c7\n\nmap\n\n\n=\n\n(\n\n\u03c7\n\nhard\n\n\n,\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n,\n\n\u03c7\ni\n\n)\n\n\n. In this case we construct soft data of the probabilistic types based on geological constraints \n\n\nx\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n using GWR. As a consequence, the uncertainty knowledge can be written\n\n\n\n\nP\nS\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nsoft\n\n\n\u2264\n\u03be\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n-\n\u221e\n\n\u03be\n\n\nd\n\nx\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n\nf\nS\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the subscript \n\nS\n\n represents that uncertain knowledge used to derive probabilities density function (pdf) of the random vector \n\n\nx\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nP\nS\n\n\n is the probability operator.\nAs stated previously, the aim of spatial mapping is to estimate the unmeasured points set \n\n\np\ni\n\n\n based on the general knowledge and specific knowledge available. The posterior pdf of \n\n\np\ni\n\n\n for the probabilistic soft data,\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\nmap\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nf\nG\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\nmap\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\u03c7\n\nhard\n\n\n,\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u222b\n\nf\nG\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\ndata\n\n\n,\n\u03c7\n\n\nhard\n\n\n,\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n)\n\nd\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\nf\nG\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c7\n\nhard\n\n\n,\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n)\n\nd\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c7\n\nhard\n\n\n=\n\n[\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n,\n\np\n3\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\np\nh\n\n]\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03c7\n\nsoft\n\n\n=\n\n[\n\np\n\nh\n+\n1\n\n\n,\n\np\n\nh\n+\n2\n\n\n,\n\np\n\nh\n+\n3\n\n\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\np\n\nh\n+\nn\n\n\n]\n\n\n denote the number of hard data and soft data within a specific range, respectively. The subscript \n\nG\n\n represents the general knowledge base (i.e., mean and covariance model in our study). This posterior pdf rigorously incorporates various the dependency of the data and the difference in accuracy between the hard and soft data (Douaik et al., 2004). The different statistical values, including mean, mode and variance, can be calculated based on posterior pdf. More details regarding the data types and BME algorithm can see Christakos (2000). The BME analysis and mapping are complemented by using ArcGIS and the interactive software library of SKES-GUI in this study.\n\n\n\n4\nData analysis and results\nIn the light of the above mentioned geological setting, mid-acidic magmatic rock of Yanshanian, NE linear structures, Archean metamorphic rock and intersection of faults are primary influences on the formation and distribution of geochemical anomalies in this area (Fig. 4\n). We computed the Euclidean distance from each cell in the raster to the closest source (i.e., faults, rocks, formation and fault intersections), and transformed the distance raster into 0 to 1 scale based on a specified fuzzification algorithm, indicating the increased strength levels of mineralization favorability (Fig. 5\n). The spatial distributions of Fig. 5 showed the close spatial relationship with the discovered deposits. The GWR was used to establish the spatial relationships between these geological constraints and geochemical anomalies, acquiring the local estimations and standard error (Fig. 6\n). As a consequently, the mean and variance of probability soft data are generated based on GWR.\nThe integration of hard data (i.e., SPC5) and the constructed soft data using BME produced posterior pdf. The spatial distribution of posterior pdf elaborates the BME prediction, and the mean of posterior pdf was adopted to investigate geochemical anomalies in this study (Fig. 7\n). The spatial distribution of Fig. 7(a) revealed Mo polymetallic mineralization taking geological constraints under consideration. The seven different color symbologies depicted the area proportions of 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 20% and 30% of this study area for Fig. 3(b), Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. 7 (a). Compared with the results of SPC5 (Fig. 3b) and GWR (Fig. 6a), these results showed similar spatial trends, however, the results produced by BME revealed more local specific information. The spatial relationships between the discovered deposits and cumulative area showed that BME showed better prediction results (Fig. 7b), and what's more BME is more suitable for the deposits at different periods. As above description in geological setting, there are mainly three periods of molybdenum polymentallic mineralization occurrence in this study area, which take Caosiyao, Dasuji and Quanzigou as representatives, respectively. The results of BME delineated the deposit with different mineralization background more effectively compared to other methods. The samples were missing in southeast parts of this study area, resulting that there were not geochemical anomalies can be exposed for SPC5 scores. For BME and GWR, the missing information was supplemented by ancillary data (i.e., geological constraints), which revealed some geochemical anomalies in these areas without sample data. It can be concluded from the statistics of cross validation that these prediction mean were similar (Table 2\n). The prediction standard variance was reduced after integrating the geological constraints, and improved the prediction accuracy. The prediction results of three methods have small root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The RMSE and MAE of GWR and BME were slightly larger than SPC5, indicating that the results based on GWR and BME have a high fluctuation in local areas. The local extremums were important implications for suggesting local geochemical anomalies.\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThis study aims to develop a model framework for integrating geochemical data and geological constraints for the geochemical anomalies identification without restrictive or unrealistic assumptions. Geological constraints are a critical concern for delineating mineralization area especially at large scale sampling area. Integration of geophysical and geological information in catchment-based geochemical data analysis can enforce understanding of bedrock and regolith characteristics (Cracknell and de Caritat, 2017). Some geostatistical methods can also take some auxiliary information into the geochemical data processing (e.g., co-kriging and weighted kriging), which suffer from restrictive assumptions about spatial or temporal correlation structures and types of data (Beckerman et al., 2013). Kriging is mainly to focus on how to deal with geoscience data, instead of integrating them into the interpretation process (Christakos 2000). The restricted predictive capacity of simple kriging was likely caused by limited auxiliary data. The BME based only on hard data generates the same spatial distribution with simple kriging or ordinary kriging (Christakos, 2000; Orton and Lark, 2007). Some contrast researches of BME and kriging methods have been carried out in spatial prediction mapping, which illustrated the generated results using BME were more reasonable and interpretable.\nSome literatures have attempted to detect the geochemical anomalies using the same geochemical dataset in this study area (Yang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). A key characteristic of the published studies is that they overlooked the effects of geological constraints on geochemical exploration. When these auxiliary information was ignored, the resulting predict capacity of geochemical anomaly was restricted and unreliable. Especially, the sample density is sparse in some parts of this study area, which raises the possibility of auxiliary data support to inform predictions over large areas with missing data. Additionally, most of studies usually treated incomplete information (e.g., constraint factors and uncertainty data, etc.) as missing data to avoid generating potentially misleading prediction results (Yu et al. 2009). We use a hybrid approach that combined GWR and BME, which not only emphasized the primary importance of geochemical data and compensated for the incompleteness of sampling data. The cross-validation results indicated that the proposed model reduced the effect of missing data and captured the local spatial variations of elemental concentrations (Table 2). The prediction errors were higher for only soft data available, which was an argument of increasing uncertainty in areas where hard data are limited.\nIn BME framework, the prior information is a critical component for inference tasks. One of the most significant benefits is that the use of prior information can save substantial research time and costs associated with data collection and analysis (McCarthy and Masters, 2005; Kuhnert et al. 2010; He and Kolovos, 2018). Prior information as the auxiliary constraint information can make up for the deficiency or even missing data. Bayesian approach incorporating prior information might achieve precise evaluation in the presence of sparse or missing data samples, which can also measure of uncertainty by probability based on prior information (Shoemaker et al. 1999; He and Kolovos, 2018). BME takes into consideration the prior information to improve prediction results. Another highlights of the BME framework has rigorous mathematical theory for incorporating soft data (Christakos, 2002; Martin et al., 2012; Shi et al. 2015). The flexible BME framework makes it possible to integrate various types of general knowledge by its prior PDF. Compared with the classic geostatistics, BME take multi-sourced data types and uncertainties as conditional probabilities into account without making any restraints and assumptions (such as data distributional assumptions, stationarity assumptions, etc.), which restrict the use of geostatistical methods (Christakos, 2000; P\u00e9rez-Hoyos et al., 2012; He and Kolovos, 2018). The BME method avoids gaussian and unbiasedness assumptions, and can always express incomplete information on the basis of soft data that can take various forms of interdisciplinary knowledge (e.g., interval values, Gaussian, triangular and uniform distribution) that approximate local or global data uncertainties (Sadeghi, 2020; Yu et al. 2009).\nIn this study, the constructed geological constraints (i.e., mid-acidic magmatic rock of Yanshanian, NE linear structures, Archean metamorphic rock and intersection of faults) were favorable spatial positions for mineralization occurrences. The spatial relationships were measured by the spatial distance from geological constraints. Accordingly, the generated four constraint factors were typical spatial heterogeneity. The GWR model produced the spatial local parameter values (including prediction and variances maps) by local regression. Table 2 and Fig. 7b showed the GWR prediction is reliable by integrating the given soft data. The produced posterior pdf based on bayesian conditionalization had minimum uncertainty by accounting for a sufficient number of key geological factors (Serre and Christakos, 1999).\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe combination of BME-GWR is a valuable model for considering various constraints for geochemical anomalies identification. The BME provides a flexibility framework for incorporating various sources of auxiliary information based on mathematical rigor. The GWR model can achieve local variations of geological variables, and was used for generating soft data. The main objective of this study is to generate geochemical anomaly maps with highly accuracy by taking geological constraints into account. The mid-acidic magmatic rock of Yanshanian, NE linear structures, Archean metamorphic rock and intersection of faults were extracted as the constraint factors of molybdenum polymetallic mineralization. The hard data and the constructed soft data using GWR was integrated by BME, and obtained the posterior pdf. The mean of posterior pdf was adopted to explain the spatial distribution of geochemical anomalies. We concluded that the integration of geological constraints can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of geochemical anomalies, especially for sparse sampling and deposits with different geological settings. This study demonstrated that ancillary data can reduce the influence of missing data and improve the prediction accuracy during geochemical anomaly identification.\nFuture work should focus on the constructions of more different types of soft data. We attempted to build the probability soft data in this work, whereas the results based on different types of soft data could be compared in future. More ancillary information should be considered in mapping of geochemical process, which provided an opportunity to solve the problem of data missing. Such as, geochemistry landscape constraints (e.g., topography, catchment basin and covers) can be taken into account in further research. It is hoped that the findings of this study can stimulate further study on the application of BME in geoscience.\n\n","58":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nUranium resources as strategic energy have an important strategic position in national defense, science and technology. Sandstone-type uranium deposits rank second in all types of uranium deposit, accounting for about 40% of the world's total uranium resources (Lehmann, 2008; Xing et al., 2017). Main uranium resources concentrate in Australia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada, Niger, South Africa and other countries (Cuney and Kyser, 2008). The US sandstone-type uranium reserves of about 280,000 tons (U2O3) are mainly distributed in the Wyoming Basin, the Colorado Plateau, and the South Texas Coastal Plain (Boberg, 2010; Mclemore, 2011; Hall et al., 2017). The total reserves of Australian sandstone-type uranium deposits are about 123,000 tons (U2O3), mainly distributed in the Paleozoic and Cenozoic basins. The Central-Asia Uraniferous Province (CAUP) became more and more prospective for deposit discoveries with uranium ore deposits located from the Transbaikal region in Russia, in southern Kazakhstan, in Uzbekistan, in Mongolia and in North China (OECD-NEA\/IAEA, 2010). The main uranium deposits in the Central Asian distribute mainly in Kyzylkum province in Uzbekistan and the Syrdarya and Shu-Sarysu provinces in southern Kazakhstan. In Northern China, sandstone-type uranium deposits are mainly distributed in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic basins, account for 50% of China's uranium resources (OECD-NEA\/IAEA, 2014).\nThe coexistence of uranium deposits, hydrocarbons, and coal fields within the same basin is a common feature in North China. The idea of comprehensive multi-energy mineral exploration has been recently put forward by previous scholars in China (Deng et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2015). The role of the hydrocarbon-bearing fluid was emphasized especially when discuss the uranium mineralization in red-layers (Deng et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2011; Chi and Xue, 2014; Miao et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2020). Under the guidance of idea of joint exploration in uranium and energy resources, a series of large-scaled sandstone-type uranium deposits had been discovered in the southern margin of the Ili Basin, the periphery of the Junggar Basin, the Ordos Basin, the Erlian Basin and the Qianjiadian area of the Songliao Basin in recent years (Deng et al., 2005; Cai et al., 2007a; 2017b; Fan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2011; Bonnetti et al., 2015a,b; Miao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019; Zhang, 2019). Whereas, the mechanism for uranium reduction and enrichment during organic and inorganic interaction is not well understood and has long been underestimated.\nIn northern China, the discovered super large and large deposits are mainly distributed in the shallow slope belt at the edge of the large Mesozoic sedimentary basin. At present, the exploration of sandstone-type uranium deposits in the inner and deep parts of the basin (>700\u202fm) is relatively rare limited by the effective deep exploration and prospecting techniques (Zhang, 2005; Chen et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019; Miao, 2020). Recent years, considerable achievements have been obtained supported by National Key Research and Development Plan \u201cExploration and Exploitation of Deep Earth Resources\u201d, of which the purpose is to innovate the deep exploration technology and methods and contribute to the understanding of metallogenic mechanism of uranium deposit at the exploration depth >700\u202fm. For example, sandstone-type uranium deposits in Pengyang district located at the southwestern Ordos Basin was discovered in the eolian sediments of the Cretaceous Luohe Formation at depth of 700\u202fm to 2000\u202fm (Miao, 2020). The newly discovered large uranium deposit in Pengyang region is the world's first uranium deposit hosted in eolian sandstone, which almost overturned the conventional view of sandstone-type uranium mineralization in reductive fluvial - delta sedimentary strata.\nIn this study, we reveal the metallogenic mechanisms of the sandstone-type uranium deposits in Pengyang area in the southwest of the Ordos Basin and provide the comprehensive ore-forming theory referring to the reservoir properties of sand bodies, paragenetic association of minerals and alteration zonation, paleoclimatic and tectonic control factors, which will shed lights on theoretical research and future exploration of uranium in the Ordos basin and elsewhere in Asia with similar circumstances. By systematic research of geochemical characteristics, isotopic features and detailed mineralogical observation, we propose that the coupling of the supergene uranium-bearing fluid and hydrocarbon-bearing fluid can lead to the enrichment and mineralization of a huge amount of uranium in the slope belt where faults conducted the deep ancient oil and gas reservoirs. The reactions between microorganisms and organic matter may also play critical roles in uranium reduction.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nThe Ordos Basin\nThe Ordos Basin is located in the western part of North China plate, scissors-like clamped by the Hercynian Inner Mongolia-Daxinganling orogen to the north and the Indo-Sinian Qilian-Qinling orogen to the south (Fig. 1\na, b) (Ritts et al. 2004; Xue et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2016). The Mesozoic\u2013Cenozoic nonmarine Ordos Basin developed on the Paleozoic North China platform on a basement of Archean and Proterozoic continental crust. The whole basin covers an area of 250,000\u202fkm2 and appears as a nearly north\u2013south rectangle surrounded by several mountain belts: the Yinshan belt (Daqingshan and Langshan mountains) to the north; Taihangshan mountains to the east; Qinling mountains to the south; and Liupanshan, Helanshan and Zhuozishan mountains to the west. Affected by Pacific plate subduction and Himalayan tectonic movement, a series of grabens developed between these mountains and the Ordos Basin, including the Hetao graben to the north, the Shanxi graben to the east, the Weihe graben to the south and the Yinchuan graben to the west (Deng et al., 2005;Yuan et al., 2007; Akhtar et al., 2017). Tectonically, the Ordos Basin can be divided into six structural units: Yimeng uplift, Western margin thrust belt, Tianhuan depression, Shanbei slope, Jinxi flexural fold zone, and Weibei uplift (Fig. 1c).\nThe stratigraphy of the basin in the Paleozoic are constituted by Cambrian and Ordovician carbonates, with a regional depositional hiatus and erosion lasting from the Middle Ordovician to the Early Carboniferous, and persistent Upper Carboniferous\u2013Permian coal\u2013bearing fluvial\u2013deltaic clastics deposition, interlayered with minor shallow marine carbonates. The Mesozoic strata mainly consist of lower Cretaceous fluvial and eolian red beds and the Triassic - Middle Jurassic fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine sandstones, shales, mudstones and coals (Fig. 2\n) (Jiao et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Ritts et al., 2004). Tertiary deposits are almost restricted to marginal grabens, while Quaternary deposits are widely distributed in whole basin dominated by loess and alluvium (Fig. 2). These sediments have an average thickness of 4\u20135\u202fkm, with a maximum of over 10\u202fkm along the western margin of the basin (Yang et al., 2006b).\nIt is noteworthy that the Ordos Basin is a representative multi-energy resources basin, containing various energy resources (oil, gas, coal and U) (Fig. 1c). The recoverable oil and gas resources in the basin were estimated to be approximately 18\u202fbillion bbl and 315 Tcf, respectively (Strategic Research Center for Oil & Gas Resources of the Ministry of Land and Resources, P.R.C. 2010). There are three important periods for coal deposition in Ordos Basin, of which the Carboniferous-Permian coals are widespread distributed in the basin and act as coal-formed gas source rock for Upper Paleozoic gas fields, whereas the Triassic and Jurassic coal seams are restricted to local regions in basin and are relatively immature to early mature with low Ro values (Dai et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2016).\nThe south and southwest of the basin are the main petroleum production areas, with the total proved reserves ranking fourth in China. According to Yang et al. (2006b), Paleozoic gas and Mesozoic oil systems are present in the Ordos Basin. In the Paleozoic gas system, Lower Ordovician marine carbonates and Pennsylvanian\u2013Lower Permian coal seams are favorable source rocks. It is known that a significant regional unconformity between the Middle Ordovician to the Pennsylvanian is present in the basin, attributable to the Caledonian Orogeny (Liu and Yang, 1997; Zhang et al., 2004). In the Mesozoic oil system, Upper Triassic lacustrine mudstones are the principal source rocks. Upper Triassic deltaic sandstones and overlying shallow-lacustrine\/swamp mudstones serve as the superexcellent reservoir\u2013seal couplet. And the fluvial sandstones of Lower Jurassic combined with the overlying shallow-lacustrine mudstones are also the significant target beds for oil and gas exploration.\nIn addition to the spectacular success in the exploration and production of oil, gas, and coal over the last decade, many sandstone-hosted uranium deposits have been discovered. Previous studies have confirmed that uranium deposits and occurrences are primarily distributed along the margins of the Ordos Basin (Fig. 1c), for instance, the Dongsheng- Hangjinqi- Daying uranium district located in the Yimeng Uplift, Ciyaopu- Huianpu mineralization district of Ningdong ore cluster located in the overthrust belt, the National Bay uranium mineralization district in the southwest margin of the basin, Diantou uranium deposit cluster in Hangling-Binxian area located in the Weibei Uplift, the northwest Hongjing mineralization area and the southeast Baishui uranium mineralization area (Wu et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). Especially, the Dongsheng-Hangjinqi-Daying ore clusters contain a series of large-sized sandstone-hosted uranium deposits and have become the most uraniferous region in China, hosting tens of thousands of metric tons of estimated recoverable uranium resources at an average grade of 0.05% U (Yang et al., 2006a,b; Zhang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Zhang, et al., 2019a,b; Zhu et al., 2019; Miao, 2020).\nPrevious exploration and investigation revealed that industrial uranium mineralization was dominantly distributed in the Zhiluo Formation of Middle Jurassic, which deposited in the braided fluvial and braided deltas environment. However, recent study implies that the terrestrial fine detritus formation of Lower Cretaceous Liupanshan Group and Zhidan Group are squeezed into the most prospective reservoirs for uranium mineralization, particularly in the regions in southwest of the Ordos Basin.\n\n\n2.2\nGeological features of ore body\nThe study area located in Pengyang district in the southwest margin of Ordos Basin. The tectonic landforms were represented by diverse topography in the Loess Plateau, which covered by thick loess sediment, with Cretaceous bedrock exposed in the gully. The Pengyang area successively received terrestrial sediments and was characterized by low magmatism frequency in Mesozoic era. The Cretaceous desert deposits in the Ordos Basin are widely distributed. The strata of Cretaceous Zhidan group from top to bottom are Yijun formation, Luohe Formation, Huanhe-Huachi formation, Luohandong Formation and Jingchuan Formation respectively (Fig. 2). The Zhidan Group are mainly composed of variegated fluvial - lacustrine facies deposits, in addition to piedmont alluvial fans and eolian sand deposits. The uranium-bearing horizon is the Lower Luohe Formation (K1\nl), which is characterized by very thick red fine-grained sandstone developed under an eolian sedimentary environment (Fig. 3\n) (Jiang et al., 2001; Xing et al., 2018). The Pengyang uranium deposit is located at the southwestern margin of the Tianhuan depression zone of the Ordos Basin, adjacent to western over thrust belt (Fig. 4\n). The Tianhuan Depression structure with a moderately wide east wing and a steep and narrow west wing (Guo et al., 2019), had experienced Indosinian, Yanshanian and Himalayan movements, which represent the Late Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous tectonic events, respectively.\nPengyang area is near the southwest of main production area of Qingyang oil field, and the prospect districts were delineated based on the comprehensive application of cores, logs and seismic data by re-examining the exploration area in Oil and gas field. Several uranium abnormal holes and industrial holes were discovered at depths ranging from 700\u202fm to 3000\u202fm by strong Gamma-ray intensity (Fig. 5\n). The log response of the target sandstone reservoirs are characterized by strong Gamma radiation intensity, high resistivity, high wave velocity and low spontaneous potential. Large-scaled sand body with good continuity and permeability has the great prospecting potential and the identified mineralization maximum thickness is up to 10\u202fm. The grade of 4 uranium industrial holes are 4.51\u202fkg\/m2, 3.05\u202fkg\/m2, 9.78\u202fkg\/m2 and 3.68\u202fkg\/m2, respectively. The deepest drilling hole has reached up to 2000\u202fm at Pengyang area of the southwestern Ordos Basin, providing continuous, high-resolution Cretaceous terrestrial strata and geological records.\nThe lithological combinations and facies of Luohe Formation in the southwestern margin of the Ordos Basin are comparatively complicated and variable than that of the center of the Ordos Basin. Desert facies, alluvial fan facies and fluvial facies are developed in Pengyang-Zhenyuan area, which indicates this region is close to the erosion source area and the sedimentary environment is changeable frequently. Through comprehensive study on the lithofacies, we identified that the typical eolian sandstone constituted the main reservoir for uranium mineralization. Based on the sedimentary observations of target beds Luohe Formation, the BUZK03 and BUZK06 uranium mineralized drill holes preserved the eolian sandstone-dominated sediments(Fig. 6\n, Fig. 7\n). The delineated uranium mineralization horizon of BUZK03, BUZK06 are 14.9\u202fm, 11.5\u202fm thick respectively, hinting the great potential in this area. Uranium bodies primarily presents as tabular or lens-shaped and almost unanimously concentrated in the gray to gray-green transitional zone between oxidized red sandstone and reduced gray-green sandstone. Typical vertical zonation of sandstone type uranium ores was observed in BUZK06 drill holes, general displaying the tendency of decrease of Eh value downwards in Luohe formation. From up downwards, sandstone in the drill hole BUZK06 represents the red - yellow - gray\/grey-green color zoning consecutively and displays the typical characteristics of earth yellow sub-reduced sandstone occupying a large proportion in the lithological column (Fig. 7). In striking contrast, The ore-bearing zone are concentrated in gray sand body of upper part of stratum in borehole BUZK03, and the drill hole BUZK03 reserves the distinct reverse zonation, manifested as gray reduced sandstone in the upper strata and red oxidized sandstone in the lower strata of Luohe Formation (Fig. 8\n). From top to bottom, lithology of rocks in borehole BUZK03 is gray uranium mineralized sandstone - yellow sandstone - red sandstone - light red sandstone - yellow sandstone - desert lake mudstone - red eolian sandstone- desert lake mudstone - gray sandstone in sequence, which can hardly be interpreted by traditional interlayer-oxidation-zone metallogenic theory (Fig. 6).\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nWhole-rock geochemical analysis\nThe samples in this paper were collected from three drill holes in which uranium bodied distributed in the aeolian sandstone of the Luohe Formation in the Pengyang district. We collected samples of gray sandstone, greenish grey sandstone, purple\u2013red and yellow sandstone in color zonation. Detailed study was made in the gray-green reductive sandstones as they are the main host of uranium mineralized layer. The sandstone samples were powdered in an agate mill to\u202f<\u202f200 mesh for whole- rock analysis. Whole-rock geochemical analyses were carried out at ALS Chemex (Guangzhou) Co Ltd, Guangzhou, China by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). Prior to trace elements analysis, 50\u202fmg whole-rock powders were dissolved in sealed Teflon beakers with mixed HNO3\u202f+\u202fHF for 1\u20132\u202fdays, with HClO4 subsequently added for further digestion. After evaporation, a 5% HNO3 solution was used to dilute the sample to a determined volume of 50\u202fml for final measurement. Analyses of US Geological Survey standards BHVO\u20131 (basalt), BCR\u20132 (basalt), and AGV\u20131 (andesite) indicated that the precision and accuracy were better than 5% for the major elements and trace elements. The results were shown in Table 1\n.\n\n\n3.2\nSEM-EDS analysis\nThe SEM (A MIRA 3 LMH (FE-SEM)) was equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDAX GENESIS APEX) to assist pattern the morphology of the minerals related to uranium mineralization and the qualitative analysis of these minerals in the Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and Environments, University of Science and Technology of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Analytical conditions were 15\u202fkV accelerating voltage, 20nA beam current. Scanning electron microscopes equipped with an X-ray energy spectrometer achieve the high-resolution elements mapping to get the chemical compositions of small areas of samples and determine the areal distributions of major and trace elements in uranium minerals or altered minerals.\n\n\n3.3\nIn-situ sulfur isotope analysis\nThe gray-green sandstone represent a reduced environments in which pyrite and uranium precipitated. Thus, several samples of reductive sandstones from drill holes were selected for characterizing the morphology of pyrite and the sulfur isotope signatures to reveal the genesis of uranium enrichment. The in-situ sulfur isotope analysis of pyrite was performed using LA-MC-ICP-MS at State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Northwest University, Xi\u2019an, China. The laser ablation system is the 193\u202fnm ArF Excimer Laser Ablation System (RESOlution M\u221250, ASI), which is equipped with a 193\u202fnm ARF excimer laser. The parameters of laser energy density, frequency, and spot size are 3.6\u202fJ\/cm2, 3\u202fHz, and 25\u201337\u202f\u03bcm, respectively. In this experiment, the spot size was 35\u202f\u00b5m in diameter. The data were integrated as 32S\/34S ratio (\u03b434S in \u2030) and normalized to the troilite phase of the Canyon Diablo V-CDT meteorite. Sulfur isotope data are summarized in Table 2\n.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrography\nThe typical characteristic of eolian sandstone is high angle tabular cross-bedding generally found on the cross section of the dunes, mainly composed of red fine sandstone indicating the arid sedimentary environment. The top and bottom interfaces of the set of cross strata parallel or intersecting, correspond to the tabular and wedge cross-bedding respectively. The interior of the cross-bedding manifests as foreset laminae, which are nearly parallel with inclination angle 10-30\u00b0 and evidently converges downwards (Fig. 9\nd). In a single truncated set of cross strata, coarse grained layer downward pinch-out and the fine grained layer pinches out upwards are obviously identified, which respectively represent the grainflow tongues and wind sand ripple strata. Representative grainflow strata usually with thickness <5\u202fcm and without obvious graded sequence, developing on the slip faces of sand dunes due to the sand avalanches driven by gravity as the angle of windward slope greater than the sand repose angle (32\u201334\u00b0) (Fig. 9b, f). The typical wind sand ripple mainly developed at the base of dune set or inter-dune eolian sandsheet, displaying as thin lamination about 1\u20132\u202fcm with reverse grade sequence (Fig. 9a, d). Grainflow and wind sand ripple strata are both observed in the drilling holes samples in Pengyang uranium prospect area.\nExcept the great difference in color, the ore-barren red - yellow sandstone and ore-bearing gray- greyish-green sandstone are almost indistinguishable in macroscopic degree (Fig. 9a, c, e), both with similar proportions of detrital constituents (e.g. quartz and feldspar) and rare fragments of plant organic remnants. Distinct symmetrically alteration zones are observed along fractures in red sandstone in drill cores from the deep exploration borehole (SD01, Fig. 9g, h), with green gray color in the intra zones and light red bleaching halos in the transition zone, which provide conclusive evidence that oil\u2013gas migration formed the local reducing barrier for uranium mineralization. Micro faults, fractures are also discerned in grey reduced sandstone by the discontinuity of corresponding sedimentary laminae offsetting constant distance (Fig. 9i).\nThe sandstones reservoir are mainly fine to middle grained lithic quartz sandstone, well-sorted, debris grain-supported, containing trace clay matrix. The proportion of alteration and ore minerals are generally low (5% \u00b1), mainly including pyrite, calcite, dolomite, anatase, pitchblende and collophosphate. Debris grains including quartz, feldspar minerals are subangular to subrounded, showing point contact and bump contact relationship. The contents of quartz in sandstone range from 60% to 80%, and the content of feldspar 5\u201315%. Feldspar in the eolian sandstone are consisted of plagioclase and alkaline feldspar isomorphism series, dominated by the plagioclase series. The detrital minerals undergo dissolution process, especially displaying dissolution pits in the surface of feldspar. The altered feldspar provides an excellent site for uranium mineralization. The agglutinations of mineralized sandstone samples are dominated by coarse grained sparry calcite, accounting for 10% of the sandstone mass, cementing the debris minerals. While in the reddish oxidized eolian sandstone, variable proportions of dolomite minerals are served as cements and widely distributed in the matrix.\nIn addition to the macro observation of the oil spots, oil stains in yellow and gray sandstone and gas injection or infiltration along fissures in red eolian sandstone, the micro fluorescence characteristics of the hydrocarbon inclusions are also shown under ultraviolet light (UV) (Fig. 10\n). Hydrocarbon inclusions are mainly as secondary fluid inclusions observed in quartz minerals. Under single polarizing light, they are transparent or black speckled, displaying as rounded or oval with most are 5 \u00b5m in size. Gas-liquid two-phase hydrocarbon inclusion and oil inclusions are observed by the representative yellowish-green fluorescence (Fig. 10c, d). Hydrocarbon-bearing fluid inclusions are beaded along the internal fractures of mineral particles identified by the continuous and densely-distributed fluorescence (Fig. 10 b, f).\n\n\n4.2\nCharacteristics of trace elements\nThe enriched samples are characterized by the high contents of uranium, ranging from 59.5 to 1085\u202fppm, whereas the mineralized abnormal samples are significantly reduced to 23.3\u201357.1\u202fppm. The U content of non-mineralized sandstones are low to 1.3\u20138.6\u202fppm, basically on the verge of the natural background value of uranium in sandstone (Table. 1). We interpreted the element coupling distribution disciplinarian during uranium mineralization by detecting 25 sandstone samples collected from distinct alteration zones characterized by diverse colors (Table. 1, Fig. 11\n). Inter-element plot between the trace elements U and S displays the strong positive correlation across 5 orders of magnitude, implying the reducing metallogenic environment which resulted in the remarkable enrichment of pyrite in uranium mineralized sandstone samples (Fig. 11c). In respects to some high-grade uranium ore samples, the S contents is up to 0.1% (Table 1). This is also consistent with lithofacies observations under a microscope. The opaque minerals in red oxidized sandstone are dominated by the hematite and ilmenite, while the proportion of pyrite increases dramatically in gray-green sandstone. In view of the scarcity of detrital organic matter and sulfide in primary eolian sandstone, the formation of grey ore-bearing sandstone is resulted from oil and gas reduction in later period. Samples from the mineralized horizons show limited enrichment of P, Th, Pb, Y, Yb and Re, relative to the samples from adjacent uranium-barren horizons (Fig. 11d\u2013i). There are no obvious relevance of the contents of U and Ti (Fig. 11b), as the primary titanium is hosted in the independent heavy placer minerals, e.g. ilmenite, titanomagnetite and rutile, of which the proportion and types remain basically constant in different color zones. The low contents of Mo (<5ppm) and Re(<0.08\u202fppm) in eolian sandstone reservoir are mainly related to relatively sparser sulfide and carbon organic matter compared with sandstones\/shales of fluvial or delta facies in other uranium deposits (Fig. 11i, j). The variation of trace element barium is also comparatively irregular and the correlation between Ba and uranium concentration is indistinguishable in the Fig. 11a. Actually, the barite always serves as detrital mineral in sandstone red bed from Pengyang deposit, indicating the arid desert environment.\n\n\n4.3\nUranium occurrence\nUranium mineralization of Pengyang deposit is mainly distributed in the gray-green reductive eolian sandstone located in the Luohe Formation, unusually with minor amount of ore deposit occurring in reddish eolian sandstone or alluvial fan conglomerate. The predominant uranium mineral is pitchblende, with coffinite occurring as minor phase (Fig. 12\n). It is universal that high TiO2 contents were detected in pitchblende, sometimes masquerading as brannerite, which always is served as an indicator mineral related to hydrothermal fluid with relative higher temperature. Actually it is usually a close coexistence of anatase and pitchblende. Uranium mineral mainly occurs as the following: 1) relatively pure granular pitchblende particle with size 15\u201330\u202f\u03bcm disseminated in the clayey matrix, basically titanium free in the minerals (Fig. 12a, b); 2) impure clastic particles with size\u202f>\u202f50\u202f\u03bcm, which are derived from the partial replacement of detritus Fe-Ti oxide by colloform uranium mineral aggregates (Fig. 12c)\uff1b3) impure colloid adsorbing on the surface of amorphous TiO2 to form very fine admixture filling in the boundaries of minerals or matrix of sandstone (Fig. 12 d, e, f); 4) micrometer-size stellate or coccoid particles, usually as microspheres aggregates distributed in the pores, cracks, or margins of feldspar or quartz debris grains (Fig. 12g\u2013i); 5) pitchblende microspheres aggregates adsorbing around the clay minerals, such as illite\/smectite and chlorite in the matrix of sandstone(Fig. 12j, k); 6) pitchblende aggregates co-existed with collophanite micron-particles distributing along the margin of debris minerals (Fig. 12 l).\nDetrital accessory minerals are ilmenite, rutile, zircon, apatite and minor monazite. Fe-Ti oxide minerals mainly 40\u2013100 \u00b5m in size occur in heavy mineral-rich layers of the host sandstone and manifest as black speckled or rusty stains visible in hand specimen scale. The characterized alteration of these Fe-Ti oxide minerals is evidenced by the growing of dissolved pores and the strong depletion of Fe content, particularly reserved residual crystal skeleton (Fig. 13\na, f, g, h). The zircon is usually 40\u2013100 \u00b5m in size and the apatite is 100\u2013200 \u00b5m, both occurring as rounded spheres to irregular ellipsoids, which indicated the long distance transportation or high-energy impact environments. Rutile debris is also intensive altered and shows partially dissolved pores. The leached Ti from rutile or ilmenite grain aggregates formed colloidal TiO2 in matrix, providing the excellent medium for adsorbing uranium (Fig. 13b\u2013e). Compared with red sandstone samples, the mineralized and reduced grey to grey-green sandstone display a makeable increase in the contents of pyrite and calcite cements. The uranium mineralized samples collected from the BUZK06 drilling hole, generated bubbles when dropped the dilute hydrochloric acid solution. Different populations of pyrite are observed under backscattered electron image, one type occurring as colloidal form, cementing the debris minerals or lithic fragments, filling in the matrix of sandstone, while another type mainly shown as aggregates composed by tiny pyrite particles closely coexisting with microcrystalline calcite (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n4.4\nElement mapping\nElement mapping of mineralized sandstone demonstrated the strong correlation between uranium mineral and anatase. The anatase displays two different morphological types indicating the different formation processes. The amorphous porous TiO2 occur as tremellose intergrowth distributed in the pores or along the edges of cavities\/ fractures\/cleats of detrital quartz and feldspar. Porous subhedral to anhedral TiO2 cement generally associates with ilmenite or retains the detrital shape, occasionally as micro grains mixed with Fe oxide\/hydroxide. The voids in detrital Fe-Ti oxides resulting from the leaching of Fe contents from the grains imply the characteristic of dissolution- reprecipitation process. The other part of TiO2 displays as trellis pattern with the fragile network of lamellae of TiO2 enclosing voids, preserving the characteristic (111) planes of original ilmenite. The presence of relict TiO2 lamellae verifies the titaniferous phases are less susceptible to alteration than ferriferous phases in the ilmenite-magnetite solid solution series. These two types of TiO2 both show excellent absorption property with uranium primarily occurring as aggregates of nano to micro pitchblende crystals absorbed on the surface of porous TiO2 (Fig. 14\n).\nAs shown in BSE imaging, uranium precipitated closely linked to the presence of authigenic TiO2, evidenced by the positive correlation relationship between uranium and titanium elements in the EDS mapping (Fig. 15\n). The detrital minerals are dominated by the feldspar and quartz and manifested by the high contents of K, Al and Si petrogenetic elements in corresponding area in element maps. The interstitial material are mainly fine quartz, altered feldspar and clay minerals, filling the matrix of sandstone. The mineralized sandstone appears as gray to gray green color, revealing the reduced condition which facilitates the uranium precipitation. Especially in the gray green uranium-bearing sandstone from the drill hole BUZK06 and BUZK07, characteristic chlorite mineral ((Mg, Fe)5 Al[AlSi3O10](OH)8) in matrix is obviously detected, basically proved by the evidence of collaborative increases of Mg, Fe in clay matrix shown in element maps. Chlorite mineral displays as finely squamae to flake, somewhile as small villous shape or featherlet (Figs. 14 and 15). Another distinctive feature of mineralized sandstone confirmed by mineralogical observation is the apparent increase of calcite and pyrite in matrix. The significantly high calcium content correspond to the calcite cement, while a vast tract of mutual corroboration area of high concentrations of Fe and S in EDS maps is interpreted by the presence of pyrite cements.\nSignificantly, the crystallization of uranium minerals adjacent to or around the pyrite grains was not observed (Fig. 16\n\n\n), demonstrating that uranium mineralization likely occurred earlier than or at least simultaneously with the sulfuration of sandstone. The impurity of pyrite is highlighted by the zones of lower Fe, S and slightly higher O contents in element maps and may be commonly attributed to intergrowth with other clay minerals (Fig. 16). Especially the elevated contents of O in impure regions hints the late-stage variation in physiochemical conditions after the sulfide precipitation or the partial reduction of sulfate throughout the pyrite formation. The calcite cements are identified by the exceptionally high level of Ca element, mainly distributed in the matrix of sandstone and filling between skeleton particles. In addition, the fine collophanite occurring as fine needle- rod shape dispersed in the matrix was reflected by the high signal intensity of P and intermediate signal of Ca (Fig. 15). The surface adsorption state of uranium is obligated to the increased signals in U element mapping, with no visible independent uranium minerals around the fine-grained collophanite in BSE image (Fig. 14).\n\n\n4.5\nPyrite petrography and sulfur isotopic compositions\nBased on the noticeable dissimilarity of morphology and paragenetic mineral assemblage, ore-stage pyrite can be divided into two types: 1) largely occurring as sub-idiomorphic to idiomorphic cement or crystal aggregate, filling in the matrix and coexisting with dolomite diamond particles and clay minerals (Fig. 17): 2) intimately intergrowth or juxtaposed with secondary calcite cement, exhibiting as fine-grained aggregates with poor crystallization (Fig. 18). The type \u2160 pyrite colloform is 100\u2013200\u202f\u03bcm in size and featured by the relatively smooth surface except for a few of pores and fractures. The pores among different size particles sometimes are intermingled with authigenic quartz, albite or clay minerals. The type \u2160 pyrite cements occasionally display irregular ingredients regions with the significant increase in the contents of arsenic in intergranular cements of pyrite cubic crystals as shown slightly brighter in the backscattering image. The type \u2161 pyrite aggregates with an approximate size of 50\u2013150\u202f\u03bcm are characterized by the bad crystal morphology and poriferous surface, the closely intergrowth with micritic calcite minerals, or the tightly consolidating with calcite into lumps filling in the matrix.\nAs demonstrated by Figs. 17 and 18 and Table. 2, the \u03b434S compositions of pyrite exhibit a small range of variation, from \u221219.23 to \u221229.64\u2030. Sulfur isotope data recorded from the two morphological types of pyrite are both characterized by a relatively light signature, ranging from \u221219.23 to \u221227.22 \u2030 (N\u202f=\u202f20, Fig. 17) and from \u221221.60 to \u221229.64\u2030 (N\u202f=\u202f10, Fig. 18) respectively, implying that they are generated from bacterial sulfate reduction. Actually the sulfur isotope ratios of two types of pyrite reveal no essential differences and may reflect a single episode of FeS2 growth. There is also no fundamentally distinction in the sulfur isotopes of pyrite between uranium-bearing grey (green) sandstones and reduced uranium-barren sandstones, almost concentrated in a smaller range from \u221220\u2030 to \u221230 \u2030, hinting the relatively consistent microbial sulfate reduction rate in the open-system where sulfate is abundant.\nUnder the scanning electron microscope, the pitchblende microspheres aggregates are closely related to colloidal TiO2 or distributed in the pores of the fragmental minerals (Fig. 12). Significantly, the intimate intergrowth of uranium minerals and pyrite grains was rarely observed although the contents of U show strong correlation to the contents of sulfur (Figs. 11c, 16). It has been concluded that biogenic pyrite cements could precipitate shortly after the formation of pitchblende, which already was absorbed on the perforated surface of authigenic TiO2 colloform or altered titaniferous debris minerals. Considering that the ore-bearing sand bodies and non-mineralized sand bodies both have no detrital organic matter, and the macroscopic distinct differences in color, the substantial increase in the pyrite mineral in greyish-green to grey ore-bearing samples was related to the sulfate reducing bacteria, which was stimulated in the reducing eutrophic environment induced by the infiltrating of hydrocarbon-containing fluids into sandstone strata of Luohe Formation.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nReservoir properties\nThe Cretaceous desert deposits in the Ordos Basin are widely distributed (Fig. 3). Li et al. (1999) first discovered the dune sandstones in the north Ordos Basin and observed the high dipping large-giant tabular or wedge-shaped cross-beddings and parallel beddings in the Zhidan Group, which are the typical features of eolian sandstone and the proxy of the dry paleoclimate. Lower Cretaceous Zhidan Group were divided into five formation based on the sedimentary facies controlled by the tectonic uplift and subsidence and climate evolution in Yanshan period. From the bottom to the top, these are Yijun formation, Luohe Formation, Huanhe-Huachi formation, Luohandong Formation and Jingchuan Formation. The Luohe Formation is located in the lower part of the Zhidan Group, and is widely distributed throughout the basin, mainly a set of a typical desert system, consist of wadi, sand dune, inter-dune and desert lake subfacies (Xie et al., 2005). The Luohe Formation has a conformable contact with overlying Huanhe-Huachi Formation, typical by fluvial-lacustrine facies fine clastic sediments. The outcrops of the Cretaceous Luohe Formation in Longzhou Township, Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province, located in the center of the Ordos Basin, show Large-scale cross-bedding oblique bedding with a dip angle of 20\u00b0\u201330\u00b0, verified the eolian sandstone deposits (Zhu et al., 2018). Huang (2010) conducted a high-resolution magnetic stratigraphic study on core samples from the lower part of the Zhidan Group in the southern Ordos Basin and determined the deposition time of the Luohe Formation was 141.48\u2013135.73\u202fMa. Sedimentary facies and paleogeography researches revealed that the Ordos Basin was located in Low-middle latitude prevailing westerlies of northern hemisphere, N31.2\u00b0, in which the climate was subtropical arid during the Early Cretaceous (Jiang et al., 1997; Jiang et al., 2001). The spatial and temporal distribution and sedimentary characteristics of eolian sandstones in Zhidan Group were mainly controlled by planetary wind belt and implied the existence of the huge ancient Ordos sand sea, which was an important region distributing the Cretaceous red desert (Li et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2001). Since the Middle Jurassic, the Taihang Mountain gradually uplifted and resulted in the denudation and desertification in eastern Ordos Basin. The widespread desert facies deposit may be the earliest response to the formation of the plateau in eastern China (Deng et al., 1994, 2000; Zhang et al., 2001, 2007; Xia et al., 2012).\nThe formation age of the eolian sandstones in North China can be divided into three phases, that is, Kimmeridgian-Berrisian, Valanginian-Hauterivian and Hauterivian-Aptian. The contrastive researches of eolian in the Ordos Basin, Jianghan Basin, Sichuan Basin and Subei Basin confirmed the distribution regularities and showed that the deposit time decline westward and southward (Jiang and Li, 1996). Xu et al. (2013) investigation the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous eolian sand deposits in North China, also found the same trend that the formation time became younger westward from western Shandong Province to Gansu Province. The further researches of palaeowind direction and palaeomagnetism on eolian sandstones in North China found that the northwest wind was prevailed during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, and the eolian sandstones were distributed in the area of N25\u00b0- N45\u00b0, which belonged to the westerlies (Ma et al., 1993; Xu et al., 2013).\nThe eolian sandstone has excellent physical properties, such as stable distribution, massive thickness, high porosity, high permeability and low cement content, which served as superb reservoirs for oil, gas and sandstone-type uranium deposits. For instance, Kela 2 giant natural gas field in the Kuche Basin located in Xinjiang province was discovered as the first eolian sandstone-hosted gas reservoir (Mei et al., 2003). Cretaceous desert facies deposited in Ordos Basin are marked by a set of arid red beds, with extremely low levels of carbonaceous organic matter and pyrite. In the Pengyang uranium prospect area, the most typical feature of eolian sand is the high angle cross-bedding lamina with the dip angle of foreset laminae 25-34\u00b0. Besides, the host eolian sandstone is characterized by wind sand ripple and grainflow strata, in which inverse grain sequence can be observed (Figs. 7 and 8). The Luohe Formation is mainly composed of fine-grained quartz sandstone, and the lithofacies is relatively uniform only with the distinct difference in color between the uranium-bearing and uranium barren sandstone (Figs. 8 and 9).\nPrevious uranium exploration has confirmed the Cretaceous Luohe Formation as the second most important uranium reservoir after middle Jurassic Zhiluo Formation, which certified the great ore potentials when the sand body was reduced by extraneous hydrocarbon fluid leaked through the fault from underlying oil and gas reservoirs. The sedimentary strata of Luohe formation to Jingchuan Formation record two climate vicissitudes between arid and humid, shown as the rhythmic aquifer -confining bed sequence structure consisting of eolian facies sandstone, delta facies sandstone and lacustrine mudstone, which contributed to the formation of interlayer oxidation zone and sandstone-type uranium deposit (Xie et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006a,b; Dai et al., 2010).\n\n\n5.2\nThe features of mineral assemblage and alteration\nOur study has shown that autogenetic TiO2 occurs as veinlets or down feathers in gray to gray green mineralized sandstone, and displays peculiar intimate intergrowth with uranium minerals under scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Fig. 12). Previous scholars probed the elusive affinity between titanium-bearing minerals and uranium mineralization in sandstone uranium districts and verified that the paragenesis of metalliferous oxide mineral alteration revealed an intricate history that corresponded with multi-stages in the development of uranium deposit (Reynolds et al., 1978a,b; Force et al., 2001; Dahlkamp, 2009; Munara, 2012; Chen et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2020). For instance, Fe-Ti oxides are generally already strongly altered in the reduced part of the sandstone of roll-type uranium deposits located in South Texas (Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1978a). Raman spectra of the most altered grains indicated a mixture of Fe oxide\/hydroxide and Ti oxide micrograins. The characteristic alteration of these Fe-Ti oxides was also evidenced by a strong depletion of their Fe content relative to the original detrital composition (Deer et al., 1992; Bonnetti et al., 2015a). Force et al. (2001) inspected the magnetic ilmenite-hematite detritus in Mesozoic-Tertiary sandstone-hosted uranium deposits of the Rocky Mountains and found that the altered zones were devoid of magnetite and less abundant in Fe-Ti oxide minerals. Although some Fe-Ti oxide mineral grains preserved original detrital assemblages, most grains nearly only showed the rims of anatase. Bonnetti et al. (2015a,b) emphasized the significance of Fe-Ti Oxides in the genesis of the Bayinwula roll front-type uranium deposit in the Erlian Basin and identified that the pre-ore uranium enrichment by the altered Fe-Ti oxides, which constituted a major source of uranium for the mineralization. Indeed, the replacement of detrital Fe-Ti oxides by ore-stage biogenic iron disulphides had also been described within world-class roll front deposits in Kazakhstan (Munara, 2012). Porous anatase produced by the alteration process has larger void ratio and specific surface area, enhancing the adsorption capacity of uranyl ions, catalyzing rate-limiting reaction steps by facilitating electron transfer from underlying material or co-absorbates, and accelerating the progress of uranium enrichment (Renock et al., 2013; Latta et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2019). Chen et al. (2019) and Ding et al. (2020) both discussed the alteration of titaniferous oxide minerals and its process of uranium enrichment in the sandstone-type uranium deposits in the Northern Ordos Basin. Chen et al., (2019) emphatically considered the excellent adsorb ability of titanium-bearing minerals and the subsequent reduction precipitation by fluid. Ding et al. (2020) proposed that uranium enrichment can be achieved by adsorption- autocatalytic reduction of altered ilmenite. The ilmenite had undergone considerable alteration during sedimentary to early diagenetic stage and completely or partly altered along its edge and crack into porous leucoxene and anatase, which absorbed uranium on the surface of these minerals. Principal uranium mineralization was caused by the anatase catalytic reduction during the oxidized uranium-containing fluid infiltrated into the ore-bearing layer and was triggered by \u03b2 and \u03b3 rays produced by the pre-enriched uranium with adsorption in ore-hosting sandstone.\nIn addition to the adsorption of the iron titanium oxide, the contribution of the clay minerals can not to be underestimated (Fig. 12 j, k). In particular, in green- gray sandstone samples, some regions related to clay minerals derived from feldspar alteration are excellent sites for uranium enrichment. Intergranular pores of K-feldspar and quartz are prevalent in uraniferous sandstone (Fig. 12 g, i), may be related to the dissolution by the organic acids from the underlying oil and gas and provide favorable sites for uranium mineralization.\nActually, the adsorption and reduction of uranium are main metallogenic mechanism for Pengyang uranium deposit as uranium geochemistry is mainly governed by oxidation state. U is highly mobile as hexavalent uranyl ion (UO2\n2+) under oxidizing conditions. In reduced conditions, U4+ solubility is extremely low and similar to that of Th. The most prominent feature of the Pengyang uranium deposit in the southwest of the Ordos Basin is the normal and reverse color zoning in the borehole longitudinally. Uranium mineralization is generally concentrated at the REDOX boundary or at the side near the reductive gray to gray-green sand body (Figs. 6\u20138). The primary sandstone is a series of red deposits, characterized by the eolian sandstones in the Pengyang region (Figs. 3 and 9). The color variation observed in the drill holes from red and yellow sandstones to the green units was the result of the progressive reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+(Dahlkamp, 2009; Zhang, 2019). The red sand body turns yellow color as the disintegration of the limonite oxide films coated on the debris minerals and the leaching of the mobile Fe2+. Petrographic observation and SEM-EDS have characterized the mineralized gray-green sandstone and identified that the Fe-rich chlorite imparts the green color due to the enrichment of Fe2+. In this study, most uranium mineralization show closer ties with altered Fe-Ti oxide mineral rather than pyrite formed later in the green color sandstone. Unlike other terrestrial uranium ore deposits identified an accumulation of uranium in anoxic zones along steep redox gradients in association with organic matter and pyrite (Min et al., 2005a; Cai et al., 2007a, b; Scott et al., 2007, Ingham et al., 2014; Bonnetti et al., 2015a,b; Zhao et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Rong et al., 2019; Yue et al., 2020), the close association of sulfide minerals with uranium mineral is not found in the Pengyang eolian sandstone-hosted uranium deposit.\nWe assumed that the redox potential at the REDOX boundary governing the uranium precipitation is between the range of lines of pyrite-sulfate boundary and Fe3+-Fe2+ redox boundary in the sandstone. Previous researches indicated that Fe(III) is capable of reoxidizing U(IV). Therefore, only the trivalent iron was completely chemically reduced to Fe2+, the reduction of U6+ was initiated theoretically (Kalin et al., 2005). In the Pengyang uranium deposit, hydrocarbons migrated upward and reacted with the downward flowing oxidizing fluids, which induced the uranium mineralization. At the redox interface between the red and gray-green sandstone, iron was reduced to Fe2+ and incorporated into Fe-rich chlorite rather than formed the pyrite due to the absence of reduced sulfur supply (Zhang, 2019). Hence uranium deposits are mainly located near the interface between reduction and oxidation and precipitate as pitchblende hybrid with autogenetic TiO2 colloid (Figs. 6, 7, 12; 15). Inadequate contents of H2S and the sub-reductive environment were record by the partial reduction of sulfate, leaving the elevated contents of O in impure regions of pyrite (Fig. 16). In contrast, the redox potential of other traditional reductive sedimentary series including sandstone and coal-bearing beds in the fluvial to delta sedimentary system is relative low and, in most instances, uranium minerals directly precipitated around ore-stage or diagenesis-stage pyrite.\nAn alternative interpretation is that biological enzymes-catalyzed uranium reduction is mainly under Fe (III))-reducing conditions rather than under SO4\n2\u2212 reducing conditions (Anderson and Lovley, 2002). On the continuous depletion of oxygen in sedimentary environments, microbial anaerobic respiratory processes shift to alternative terminal electron acceptors in the succession of NO3\n\u2212, Mn (IV), Fe (III), SO4\n2\u2212 and CO2, which is often explained on a thermodynamic basis where organisms preferentially utilize the terminal electron acceptor yielding the most available energy (McCarty, 1972; Stumm & Morgan, 1981: Bouwer, 1992; Suzuki et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2020). Fe (III)-reducing bacteria can out-compete SO4\n2\u2212 reducers for substrates and pioneer to stimulate the U (VI) reduction in aquifers (Lovley & Phillips, 1987; Chapelle & Lovley, 1992). U (VI) and oxygen in the down flowing meteoric water are almost exhausted when infiltrating to the deep more reductive layers where sulfate reducing bacteria can be able to multiply and produce hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the slight delay of the precipitation of pyrite compared with uranium minerals was observed under BSE and the positive correlation between uranium and sulfur in elements plot were displayed in sandstone samples collected from Pengyang uranium prospect district (Fig. 11c, Fig. 16).\nConsidering the low contents of indigenous organic matter and relative oxidized environment in eolian sandstone, the biological respiratory intensity is at its minimum and the contents of pyrite kept quite low during the depositional diagenesis period. The seepage and emanation of oil and gas from deep reservoir to sandstone not only bring the bioavailable organic matter which stimulated the activity of Fe (III) reducers and sulfate reducing bacteria but also may bring plentiful microorganism, for instance, complementing the indigenous microbial population of sulfate reducers. Actually, the dissimilatory U (VI) reduction by bacteria coupled the oxidation of fermentative products of natural organic matter (OM) in the sandstone-hosted uranium deposit cannot be neglected (Munier-Lamy et al., 1986; Dang et al., 2018). Many laboratory and field studies have shown that the addition of electron donors such as acetate, lactate or ethanol can stimulate the activity of dissimilatory metal-reducing microorganisms, which in turn promotes U(VI) reduction in contaminated aquifers (Lovley et al.,1991; Gorby and Lovley, 1992; Abdelouas et al., 2000; Bender et al., 2000; Fredrickson et al., 2000; Anderson and Lovley, 2002; Finneran et al., 2002; Istok et al., 2004; Sani et al., 2004; Suzuki and Banfield, 2004; Vrionis et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006a,b; Komlos et al., 2007, 2008a,b; Moon et al., 2009; Cologgi et al., 2011, 2014). The microbe like structures of micron-sized ovoid-globular uranium minerals observed under EDS analysis in mineralized samples of Pengyang uranium deposit provided corroborative evidences for biomineralization (Fig. 12e) (Abdelouas et al., 2000; Labrenz et al., 2000; Lloyd, 2003; Min et al., 2005a,b; Cai et al., 2007a,b; W\u00fclser et al., 2011; Bonnetti et al., 2015a,b; Akhtar et al., 2017). Aromatic hydrocarbons addition to Luohe Formation sediments was degrade by Fe(III)-reducing organisms into acetate, which was likely to stimulate the growth of known U(VI)-reducing Fe(III) reducers, such as Geobacters, Shewanella (Lovley et al., 1991; Anderson and Lovley, 2002; Lloyd, 2003; Chen et al., 2012).\n\n\n5.3\nThe role of oil\u2013gas in uranium mineralization\nHydrocarbon migration and its role in uranium reduction and precipitation have been unequivocally defined (Szalay, 1964; Langmuir 1978; Finch 1996; Min et al. 2005a,b; Xue et al. 2010, 2011; Liu et al. 2012; Hall et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2016), which also had been verified by a number of researches from world-class sandstone uranium deposits like the Upper Cretaceous\u2013Cenozoic Chu-Sarya and Syr-Darya Basins of Kazakhstan (Jaireth et al. 2008, 2016), the South Texas Basin in United States (Reynolds & Goldhaber, 1983) and Mesozoic\u2013Cenozoic uraniferous basins, in North China(eg. the Tarim Erlian and Ordos Basins) (Qin and Zhao, 2000; Deng et al., 2005; Cai et al. 2007a,b; Fan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007a\u2013d, 2020; Xue et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2015).\n\nJaireth et al. (2008, 2016) investigated the geology of the world-class sandstone uranium deposits in the Chu-Sarysu and Syrdarya basins in the south-central portion of Kazakhstan and confirmed the low levels of indigenous organic matter in the host sandstones beds. Actually, the arid conditions facilitated the widely infiltration of oxidizing groundwater, the mobilization and concentration of uranium to form the economic deposits. Late Eocene- Pliocene sandstone reservoirs of most uranium deposits distributed in the coastal plains of southern Texas, are also devoid of detrital organic matter (Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1978a,b; Kurrus, 2016). Therefore, the well-developed oil and gas system in this region have significant contribution to the uranium mineralization. Hall et al. (2017) proposed that the plumes of reductants related to oil and gas in the Rio Grande embayment of Texas dominated the metallogenic prospects. Benavides, Felder, and Lamprecht deposits in the coastal plains of southern Texas are mainly distributed near regional fault zones and are associated with oil and gas that migrated along the faults (Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1978a,b; Kurrus, 2016; Hall et al., 2017). The sulfide-bearing fault-leaked solutions from underlying hydrocarbon accumulations played an important role in the formation of uranium deposits (Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1982).\n\nCai et al. (2007a,b) analyzed the detrital quartz particles of ore-bearing sandstones in the Dongsheng and Shashagetai sandstone-type uranium deposits in Ordos Basin by gas chromatography. The results showed that the surface of the detrital quartz in the sandstone contained a complex mixture (UCM), which was the evidence of oil and gas injection. The characteristic of gas chromatography implied that the organic matter had undergone obvious bacteria degradation. The hydrocarbon in the fluid inclusions of quartz and calcite cement in the Qianjiadian uranium deposit in the southwestern Songliao Basin also display the feature of degradation by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Zhao et al., 2018). Liu et al. (2018) investigated the Mengqiguer uranium deposit in the southern margin of the Yili Basin and determined the critical effects of CO, H2S, and CH4 gas-charging on enhancing the reduction capacity of the host sandstones and the subsequent t uranium enrichment. Xue et al. (2011) investigated the uranium deposit in the north of Ordos basin and suggested that the hydrocarbon generation not only played critical roles in providing reducing agents required for the mineralization, but also contributed to the driving force to maintain the upward flowing, reducing fluid at the redox interface with the downward flowing, oxidizing fluid.\nThe important green color alteration and bleaching phenomenon of Dongsheng U deposit was proposed by Dou et al. (2005). Zhou et al. (2002) and Liu et al. (2006, 2009) reported that the gray and dark green sandstone contained relict pink-colored altered sandstone, a feature that may reflect the secondary reduction of earlier oxidized sandstone caused from the injection of hydrocarbons derived from an underlying reservoir. Similarly, the uranium mineralization in the Northern Ordos Basin preferentially hosted within redox zones of the Zhiluo Formation consisting of a green to greyish altered transition zone within fine- to coarse-grained sandstones, which also was considered as the secondary reduction by oil and gas (Ding, 2003; Jiao et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2018a,b; Zhu et al., 2019). Wu et al. (2006a,b) and Wu and Qiu (2007) also emphatically proposed that uranium mineralization characterized by green color alterations was induced by strong reduction by hydrocarbon. Actually, higher chlorite contents contributed to the reduction of ferric iron to ferrous and the greenish color of gray green sandstone (Ding, 2003; Xiang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007a\u2013d). The Fe3+\/Fe2+ ratio of the yellow and red sandstone in the Dongsheng uranium deposit is \u223c1.84, with this ratio decreasing to 1.29 within the green altered sandstones and 0.972 in the unaltered grey sandstones (Zhang, 2019).\nIn the southern part of the Tianhuan Depression located in the southwestern marginal of Ordos Basin, the Jurassic and Triassic Chang-3 Formation are the main oil-bearing strata. Zhao et al. (2014) analyzed the biomarkers and nitrogen-bearing compounds in the oil and demonstrated that the oils trapped in the Jurassic and Chang-3 reservoirs were derived from the Triassic Chang-7 source rocks. Primary oil and gas reservoirs formed in the Tianhuan Depression during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous was reformed by the late Yanshanian and Himalayan tectonic movement (Liu et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2020). Consequently, the Tianhuan Depression axis gradually moved eastwards to the present location with a cumulative migration distance of\u202f\u223c\u202f30\u202fkm and the originally formed oil and gas reservoirs were adjusted, even destroyed and remigrated along the faults, forming secondary structural reservoirs at high positions on the western flank of the depression (Hui and Tian, 2008; Zhang et al., 2021). In the uranium industrial drilling holes located in the Pengyang uranium prospect area, we observed the typical vertical red \u2013 yellow \u2013 gray color zonation, distinct reverse color zonation, small fault (Figs. 8 and 9). In oxidized red eolian sandstone, similar small-scale alteration zoning was also identified as the permeation of oil and gas along the micro cracks of rock. Considering the very low contents of detrital organic matter in Luohe Formation, the little difference in lithology and big distinction in color between mineralized and non-mineralized sandstone, we consider that the reduction of uranium is mainly controlled by extraneous oil and gas conducted by thrust faults. The reducing environment generated by hydrocarbon facilitates the precipitation of uranium minerals, pyrite and the transformation of iron hydroxide coated on the detrital minerals to ferrous-bearing clay minerals in the matrix, e.g. chlorite. Mineralized gray-green sandstones possess more percentages of calcite as partial carbonate (CO3\n2\u2212) derived from the oxidization of hydrocarbon by microorganism.\n\n\n5.4\nSulfur isotope of pyrite\nAlthough the co-existed relationship between pitchblende and pyrite was not observed under BSE in our sample, we are not suggesting that pyrite is unrelated to uranium mineralization. That's a fact that the contents of pyrite in gray and gray-green sandstone is higher than that of red and yellow sandstone. The organic matter contents of eolian sandstones in Pengyang area is relatively low and the diagenetic oxidation environment is difficult to form and maintain pyrite. The pyrite only scatter distributes in the reduced gray to gray-green sandstone. Therefore, we infer that the reduction resulted from the oil and gas charging contributes to the formation of pyrite, which is needed the further verification of sulfur isotopes. In traditional sandstone-type uranium mineralization theory, pyrite is the most common sulfide mineral and one of the most important components for uranium precipitation (Min et al., 2005a, Scott et al., 2007, Ingham et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Yue et al., 2020, 2019). Given the results of Element mapping under BSE, we are more intrigued with the absorbing of Ti-oxide rather than pyrite on the uranium during mineralization process. However, the research of pyrite petrography and sulfur isotopic compositions are still of great significance as the big advantages on the identification the biogenic and nonbiogenic processes participating in the uranium mineralization (e.g., Goldhaber et al., 1978; Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1982; Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1983; Min et al., 2005a; Cai et al., 2007a, b; Dai et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2017; Rong et al., 2019). In our study, the content of sulfur element and pyrite in ore-bearing sandstone increase obviously compared with non-mineralized red oxidized sandstone. Micro textural analysis and in-situ LA-MC-ICP-MS S-isotope measurement of pyrite provide preliminary constraints on the depositional conditions, sources of ore-bearing fluids and mineralizing process, contributing to reveal the genesis of the uranium deposit in Pengyang prospect area.\nThe research area is near the southwest of the main mining area of Changqing Oilfield, and the reduction phenomenon of oil and gas permeating along the micro-cracks of red eolian sandstone is observed in drilling samples. Experiments have confirmed that CH4 and H2S from the oil and gas have good capacity for the reduction and enrichment of U, Mo, Se and Re in the contaminated water (Liu and Qin, 2008). Therefore, the oilfield associated H2S gas should be at the first consideration when probe into the genesis and formation environment of the uranium deposit. Hydrogen sulfide gas coexisted with oil in the Ordos basin is mainly from Mesozoic source rock and the formation process is controlled by the geological factors and reservoir properties, e.g. the proportion of gypsum mineral in the carbonate rock. The principal producing pathway of hydrogen sulfide in oil and gas reservoirs are as follows: \u2460 bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR), \u2461 thermal decomposition of sulfides (TDS), \u2462 thermochemical sulfate reduction, TSR), all confirmed as sulfur isotope dynamic fractionation process (Orr, 1974, 1977; Krouse et al., 1988; Worden et al., 1995, 2000; Worden and Smalley, 1996; Machel, 2001; Cross et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007). In general, the sulfur isotope fraction between hydrogen sulfide of TSR origin and sulfate are <15 \u2030, with main distribution range from 2.5 to 13.82 \u2030, most around 10\u2030.The sulfur isotope of hydrogen sulfide in the Mesozoic oil-associated gas are at least 20\u2030 heavier than that of sulfide produced by bacterial sulfate reduction (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Cai et al., 2003; Li et al., 2013; Ingham et al, 2014; Zhu et al., 2014; Bonnetti et al., 2017).\nA large number of studies of hydrogen sulfide derived from domestic and overseas carbonate oil\u2013gas reservoirs authenticated that the high hydrogen sulfide contents in natural gas field was the result of thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR), supported by the evidence of the positive deviations in sulfur isotope values of H2S from 1\u2030 to 31\u2030, with an average value of 15.17\u2030 (Manzano et al., 1997; Cai et al., 2003, 2005; Li et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005a, b, 2014; Zhang et al., 2007, 2008, 2012; Hao et al., 2008; Tian et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013). Sulfur isotopic compositions variation of hydrogen sulfides in the natural gas field in Sichuan Basin origin from Sinian, Permian and Triassic hydrocarbon source rock are\u202f+\u202f11.5 \u2030\u223c +23.1\u2030, \u22126.96 \u2030 \u223c +12.80 \u2030 and\u202f\u2212\u202f6.00 \u2030 \u223c +4.81\u2030, respectively (Shen et al., 1997). The average of sulfur isotope fraction between sulfate and hydrogen sulfide from H2S-bearing oil and gas fields in Zhaolanzhuang of North China, Tazhong area in Tarim Basin and Ordos Basin are 13. 82\u2030, 9. 65\u2030 and 9. 28\u2030, respectively (Zhu et al., 2014).\nMesozoic oil reservoirs which contain high-concentrated hydrogen sulfide in Ordos basin are mainly member Yan 9 and Yan10 of Yan'an Formation, distributed in Longdong district (the east of Gansu), member Yan 9 of Yan'an Formation and member Chang 2 of Yanchang Formation, which are mainly distributed in the north of Shanxi. Triassic Yanchang Formation is the main source rock for generating and expelling the hydrocarbon during the periods of Yanshan movement and Himalayan movement. Oil and gas continued to migrate, accumulate and form the reservoirs eventually in Jurassic strata. The strata temperature of the Jurassic Yan'an Formation in the Ordos Basin reached above 80\u2103 during the maximum burial period. Therefore, sulfate thermochemical reduction (TSR) in formation water is available with the addition of hydrocarbon components. Li et al. (2007a\u2013d) determined the sulfur isotopes of hydrogen sulfide in oil reservoir of Yan\u2019an and Yanchang Formation deposited in Longdong and Shanbei area. The sulfur isotope values display the relatively narrow range with 23.94\u2030\u201329.87\u2030, 30.3l\u2030\u201336.99\u2030 and 26.7\u2030\u201328.4\u2030 respectively, corresponding to the member Chang 2, Yan 9 and Yan 10.\nIn addition to direct chemical precipitation of pyrite from associated gas (H2S) of oil and gas reservoir, bacterial sulfate reduction is also an effective way to produce pyrite in the sandstone-type uranium deposit. Pyrite characterized by extremely light sulfur isotopic composition suggests a biogenic origin (Cai et al., 2007a, b; Bonnetti et al., 2015b, 2017; Akhtar et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018; Yue et al., 2020, 2019). Sulfate-reducing bacteria produce a large amount of dissolved reduced sulfur species (H2S, HS\u2212; Machel, 2001), which contribute to the largest sulfur isotope fractionation in nature and create a strong reducing barrier for precipitating uranium (Jensen, 1958; Lizitsyn and Kuznetsova, 1967; Belyi et al., 1972; Hua et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2020). It is a universal phenomenon that uranium minerals replace the strawberry or colloidal pyrite correlative with the sulfate - reducing bacteria in Erlian, Songliao, Yili and Ordos basin, which indicates that the micro-reduction environment around the pyrite facilities to the uranium minerals precipitation (Min et al., 2005a,b). The \u03b434S values of pyrite in the Shihongtan uranium deposit in the Tuha Basin range from\u202f+\u202f2.4\u2030 to\u202f\u2212\u202f39.2\u2030 (Min et al., 2005a,b). The \u03b434S value of pyrite formed in the ore-forming period in Dongsheng uranium deposit is from\u202f\u2212\u202f34 \u2030 to\u202f+\u202f17\u2030 and the \u03b434S values of the framboidal pyrite samples range from\u202f\u2212\u202f4.7\u2030 to\u202f\u2212\u202f39.20\u2030 (Cai et al., 2007a,b). The variation of sulfur isotope of strawberry-like pyrite and pyrite which replaced plant debris is\u202f\u2212\u202f72.0\u202f\u223c\u202f\u202f\u2212\u202f14.4\u2030 in the Baixingtu deposit in the southern Songliao (Bonnetti et al., 2015a,b). The \u03b434S value of pyrite in the mineralization period of the Qianjiadian uranium deposit is as low as\u202f\u2212\u202f41.4 \u2030 (Zhao et al., 2018). The above instances coincidentally indicated that bacterial sulfate reduction contributed to the negative sulfur isotope values of pyrite. Anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria use the hydrocarbon migrated along faults into the sandstone as energy to reduce sulfate (SO4\n2\u2212) to H2S and produce the negative bias in sulfur isotope. The magnitude of the sulfur isotope partitioning (fractionation) between sulfate can reach to 72\u2030 during the overall processes of BSR in natural environment (Wortmann et al., 2001; Brunner and Bernasconi, 2005; Cai et al., 2005; Bonnetti et al., 2017).\nOur results of pyrite from the uranium target layers in Pengyang region display that two morphological types of pyrite are both characterized by a relatively light signature, ranging from\u202f\u2212\u202f19.23 to\u202f\u2212\u202f27.22 \u2030 and from\u202f\u2212\u202f21.60 to\u202f\u2212\u202f29.64\u2030, respectively (Fig. 17, Fig. 18), which are much lighter than that of the hydrogen sulfide derived from Mesozoic oil associated gas generated by thermal-chemical sulfate reduction. The obvious negative bias in sulfur isotopes is much consistent with the sulfur isotopic values of pyrite generated by sulfate reducing bacteria in open system, indicating the microbial origin of pyrite (Fig. 19\n).\n\n\n5.5\nTectonic control of uranium mineralization\nPengyang uranium metallogenic prospective area is located in the west of Tianhuan Depression, adjacent the south side of the western over thrust belt, facing the Shanbei slope on the east (Liu et al., 2008, 2009; Zhu, 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2019). This uranium prospective area was determined as rectangle with about 60.9\u202fkm long from north to south, 33.5\u202fkm wide from east to west, and an area of 2049.4\u202fkm 2 after the interpretation of remote sensing image data and systematical verification of the previous oilfield drilling (Zhang, 2005; Ma et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The depth of uranium mineralization anomalies mainly distributed between 800 and 1400\u202fm of the aeolian sandstone in Luohe Formation (Miao, 2020). The first order structure Tianhuan Depression occurs as a syncline with the steep west wing of the inclination of 8\u201317\u00b0 and gentle east slope with a dip angle of 5-8\u00b0. The study area is located at the intersection of Hedao sag, Xifeng nose-fold and Chongxin sag, all of the secondary structural units of Tianhuan Depression (Lu, 2013) (Fig. 4, Fig. 20\n).\nThe prototype of Tianhuan Depression appeared as a west inclined slope in Paleozoic, and turned to a depression when the Late Triassic Yanchang Formation began to deposit (Cui et al., 2019). At this time, the subsiding center was located in Shigouyi - Pingliang district, and the deposition thickness reached up to 3000\u202fm. After Late Jurassic, the intensification of Tianhuan Depression caused the sedimentary center of the basin moving eastward (Guo et al., 2019). The subsidence zone displayed as an asymmetric synclinal structure with steep west wing and slow east wing, which served as superb drainage area for groundwater in the later period. The Ordos Basin experienced two cycles of drought- humidity climate change from the Luohe Formation - Huahe-huachi formation - Luohandong Formation -Jingchan Formation during early Cretaceous period, which contributed to the vertical stratigraphic configuration of rhythmic sedimentary sequences of aquifers- resisting layers controlled by eolian facies -delta facies -lacustrine facies (Yang et al., 2006a,b; Zhang et al., 2018a,b). The eolian sand body of the early Cretaceous Luohe Formation has a continuous single layer with large thickness and good permeability, which is conducive to the infiltration of uranium- containing oxidizing groundwater.\nSince the end of Late Cretaceous, continue to Eocene, Ordos Basin had experienced long-term, episodic overall uplift and differential denudation, causing the absent of corresponding strata (Liu et al., 2006). The fission track of apatite collected from the western over thrust belt, Weibei Uplift and the arc-shaped structural belt of Liupan Mountain confirmed the overall uplift and denudation in the southern Ordos Basin from 95 to 52\u202fMa (Chen et al., 2007). Long-term depositional hiatus and the drought paleoclimate facilitated the formation of phreatic oxidation zone and interlayer oxidation zone. Bai. (2012) researched the Mesozoic and Cenozoic structural features in the southwest of Ordos basin and found two tectonic episodes occurred in Mesozoic. The first period took place at Late Jurassic, leading to an angular unconformable contact between the Lower Cretaceous and the underlying strata. The second tectonic episodes occurred at Late Cretaceous, including the 100\u201381\u202fMa and 66\u201359\u202fMa uplifting events, corresponding to the uplift and denudation in whole basin. Chen et al. (2010) documented that the metallogenic age of Guojiawan uranium deposit located in the southwest of Ordos Basin is 98\u202fMa and uranium mineralization was mainly related to interlayer oxidation developed at the early stage of the Late Cretaceous. Previous low-temperature chronology studies showed that the Pengyang area had experienced multiple tectonic movements since Late Cretaceous, 114\u202fMa, 90\u202fMa, 60\u202fMa and 40\u202fMa, respectively (Chen et al., 2007). It is well known that the southwest of Ordos Basin is a place where oil and gas are enriched. The dark mudstone in the Chang 7 Member in Zhenyuan-Jingchuan area is an excellent source rock, which entered the threshold of hydrocarbon generation triggered by the middle Jurassic thermal event and began to expel hydrocarbons to form the oil and gas reservoir in suitable tectonic structures. The peak of oil generation reached at the end of Early Cretaceous (Zhao et al., 1996; Ding et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Tectonic thermal events of the Late Cretaceous occurred under a compression environment, promoting the escape of oil and gas from the reservoirs in the underlying layer (Qu et al., 2003; Gong et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2018a,b). Especially at the end of the Early Cretaceous, study area experience the tectonic inversion, which damaged some oil and gas reservoirs in Yan 'an Formation, leading to the migration of hydrocarbon to the higher position in the southwest margin of Ordos basin (Wang, 2011). Structural slope zone formed in the wings of Tianhuan Syncline are also suitable places for uranium mineralization as proximal to uranium-rich erosion source area and liable to infiltrate the O\u2013U-bearing water. Therefore, uranium occurred reduction and precipitation when oxygenated uranium-bearing groundwater seeped through the eolian sandstones of Luohe Formation and encountered the hydrocarbon migrating along the faults (Fig. 20).\nDuring Late Miocene to Pliocene, the western margin thrust belt adjacent to the western wing of Tianhuan Depression uplifted slowly and continuously, which supposed to be a far field effect influenced by the continuous subduction and compression of the Indian plate to the Eurasian plate (Li et al., 2006a,b; Liu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Qi, 2018; Guo et al., 2019). Thrust tectonics extensively occurred at the west margin of the Ordos Basin, which also conducted the petroleum and gas in deep reservoir to shallow strata and provided the reduced materials for uranium enrichment (Li et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). Liupan Mountain began to uplift at the early Miocene record by the apatite fission track as 7.5\u202fMa (Zhao et al., 2007a,b). The uplift in the west and extensive sedimentation occurring in the east of the basin reversed the previous sedimentary models (Zheng et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2010). The apatite samples distributed in the western margin area were determined and the fission track age showed that this tectonic period continued from 13.1\u202fMa to 4.8\u202fMa. In-situ SIMS U-Pb dating of pitchblende minerals from sandstone-type uranium deposit in Shenyuhe district in the southwestern of Ordos Basin record the age 8.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.86\u202fMa and 1.21\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.39\u202fMa, corresponding to two stage of uranium mineralization occurring in Late Miocene and Pleistocene respectively (Zhang, 2019). This result revealed that one of the uranium metallogenic epoches was contemporaneous with the period of the uplift and denudation of Liupan Mountain.\nThe tectonic-sedimentary evolution and structural reconstruction occurring in late Yanshan- Himalayan epoch not only played critical roles in finalizing the shape of the basin and the models of structural styles, but also provided a good tectonic environment for uranium mineralization (Guo et al., 2019). Especially, during the Himalayan period, dextral shear-tensile stress imposed on the Ordos Basin arise from the simultaneously effects of the subduction of Pacific Plate and the collision of Indian Ocean plate to the Eurasian plate (Zhang et al., 2021). The main tectonic structures in southwest of Ordos Basin are mainly composed of large thrust-nappe structures and anticline\/syncline. Such as the thrust-nappe and the anticline\/syncline structures distributed along the line of Laoba Mountain-Jingyuan, the line of Xiaohuangmao Mountain- Sanguankou respectively and the anticlinal structure along the line of Yindonggou-Pengyang. Besides the thrust faults, NE trending strike-slip faults also developed in the area covering the Kongtong Mountain - Taitong Mountain (Fig. 4). In fact, the soothing anticlines of the structural slope zones, the transition area between uplift and sag of the sub-level of secondary structural units, various structural slope zones formed between the uplift\/bruchfalten zones in the margins of basin and the eastern Shanbei Slope are all favorable structural patterns for the infiltration of uranium-bearing groundwater during tectonic uplift and sedimentation hiatus (Zhang et al., 2018a,b). The tectonic activity caused the basement faults reactivation in southern Ordos Basin and differential uplift\/strata tilt in Pengyang-Jingchan district, and also generated unequal scaled en echelon and x-type conjugate shear fractures (Zhang et al., 2021). Field observation and interpretation of seismic and gravity data indicated that the spatial distribution of uranium deposits were consistent with NE-SW direction faults in Pengyang prospect area (Li et al., 2020). These faults provided an important channel for ore-forming fluids. In the study area of Pengyang uranium prospect district, a large concealed thrust faults was developed in the west margin of Maqu Township, where the drilling samples were collected. The study area is also located at the transition slope region between Hedao sag and Xifeng nose-fold, both of the secondary structural units of Tianhuan Depression (Lu, 2013) (Fig. 4), which indeed is a superb place for uranium mineralization.\n\n\n\n6\nConcluding remarks\n\n\n\n1)\nThe newly discovered Pengyang uranium prospect area in the southwest of the Ordos Basin is the world's first uranium deposit hosted in eolian sandstone. Large- scaled sand body of Lower Cretaceous Luohe Formation with good continuity and permeability serves as a suitable reservoir for uranium mineralization. As the deficiency of detrital organic matter in the mineralized sandstone, exotic hydrocarbon-containing reducing fluids leaked from the adjacent oil field is responsible for the formation of uranium deposit.\n\n\n2)\nThe main occurrence of uranium is pitchblende in the gray-green ore body, predominantly absorbed on amorphous TiO2 or replacing the detritus Fe-Ti oxide minerals. Micrometer-size coccoid particles of pitchblende may imply the microbe like structures related to the dissimilatory U (VI) reduction by Fe (III)-reducing bacteria.\n\n\n3)\nUranium bodies concentrated in the gray to gray-green sandstone in transitional zones. Whole rock geochemistry analyses of sandstone samples collected in the target layers display the strong positive correlations between U and S. Uranium elements maps display that pyrite almost has no correlation with uranium enrichment, demonstrating that pitchblende precipitated earlier than pyrite. The absorption of Ti-oxide plays more important roles than pyrite reduction on the enrichment of uranium during mineralization process.\n\n\n4)\nSulfur isotope data recorded from the two morphological types of pyrite are both characterized by a relatively light signature, ranging from\u202f\u2212\u202f19.23 to\u202f\u2212\u202f27.22 \u2030 and from\u202f\u2212\u202f21.60 to\u202f\u2212\u202f29.64\u2030 respectively, implying that they are generated from bacterial sulfate reduction process. The hydrocarbon from oil and gas filed migrated along the fault to the Luohe Formation and provided reduced anaerobic environment and nutrients for the stimulation of sulfate-reducing bacteria and U (VI)-reducing Fe (III) reducers.\n\n\n\n\n","59":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGold deposits are found in a range of environments. Among them, deposits associated with intrusions, including porphyry- and epithermal-type (Kesler et al., 2002; Tosdal et al., 2009; Williams-Jones et al., 2009), account for significant Au total production. Even for the Carlin-type gold deposit, which was thought to be formed by amagmatic hydrothermal fluids for a long time (Cline et al., 2005; Emsbo et al., 2003; Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Ilchik and Barton, 1997; Large et al., 2011), more and more evidences for their magmatic-hydrothermal origins were provided (Kesler et al., 2005; Large et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021). Thus, magmatic-hydrothermal fluids could form a total range of gold deposits with decreasing temperature and pressure. The behavior and occurrence of gold in these magmatic hydrothermal fluids, especially in those with intermediate temperature (i.e., mesothermal fluids), are important to understanding the genesis of gold mineralization. Gold is commonly associated with sulfides in above types of Au deposits (Bierlein et al., 2006; Cline et al., 2005; Cook et al., 2013; Deditius et al., 2014; Groves et al., 1998; Lang and Baker, 2001). Previous studies on the gold and other trace elements in sulfides from porphyry-, epithermal- and Carlin-type gold deposits have significantly promoted our understanding to their genesis. However, only limited research was conducted on sulfides from mesothermal gold deposits, commonly with veined gold mineralization and known as vein-type deposits. Occurrence and enriched processes of gold in these deposits remain controversial: gold was commonly thought to be occurred as visible gold, but latest studies have demonstrated that a significant amount of invisible gold (lattice-bound gold and\/or gold occurring as nanoparticles, Cook and Chryssoulis, 1990) were hosted within the sulfide (Li et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2020). The Habo Au polymetallic deposit in the south of the Ailaoshan-Red River tectonic zone (ASRRTZ), Yunnan Province, is a typical intrusion-related vein-type deposit, as documented in this paper. It provides a good opportunity to resolve the above problems. In this study, we present new in-situ S\u2013Pb isotopic data for sulfides from the Habo deposit to constrain the source of mineralizing fluids and metals. In-situ trace elemental data and SEM images for mineralization-related pyrites are used to reveal the occurrence and behavior of gold and other trace elements in these mesothermal vein-type gold deposit.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Ailaoshan-Red River tectonic zone (ARRTZ) is bordered with the Indochina block on the west by the Ailaoshan fault and the South China block on the east by the Red River fault, and extended southward into the South China Sea (e.g., Fig. 1\n, Dewey et al., 1988; Hou and Zhang, 2015; Leloup et al., 1995; Tapponnier et al., 1990; Wang et al., 2001; Yin and Harrison, 2000). The ARRTZ are separated into several units by four NW-trending regional shear faults, i.e., the Red River, Ailaoshan Jiujia-Mojiang and Lixianjiang faults. The tectonic units include the Ailaoshan high-grade metamorphic zone, the Ailaoshan suture zone and the low-grade metamorphic Paleozoic\u2013Mesozoic sedimentary units (Liu et al., 2015): The high-grade metamorphic rocks (e.g., gneiss, amphibolite, marble and schist) of the Proterozoic Ailaoshan Group are discontinuously exposed in the ASRRTZ. The Ailaoshan suture zone are characterized by Late Paleozoic ophiolitic fragments, greywacke, schist, chert and limestone and associated volcanic rocks (Jian et al., 2009a, 2009b; Liu et al., 2015; Metcalfe, 2002). The ophiolitic fragments include serpentinized peridotites, diabase-gabbro association and marine basalt and sediments from the bottom to the top. To the west of the Ailaoshan high-grade metamorphic zone, Paleozoic to Mesozoic rocks are widely distributed along the western flank of ARRTZ or along the eastern margin of the Simao basin. Extensive gold mineralization are distributed along the ASRRTZ and constitute the Ailaoshan Au belt. To date, five large gold deposits, i.e., Laowangzhai (22\u00a0t at 5.29\u00a0g\/t Au in metal), Donggualin (45\u00a0t at 5.10\u00a0g\/t), Jinchang (32\u00a0t at 2.69\u00a0g\/t), Chang\u2019an (40\u00a0t at 5.84\u00a0g\/t) and Daping (60\u00a0t at 14.30\u00a0g\/t), and eight medium and numerous small gold deposits have been discovered in the belt. Most Au deposits in the belt are attributed to orogenic-type based on the tectonic settings and geological features (e.g., Deng et al., 2015b, 2014a; Gao et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2018). However, reliable ages for the mineralization are generally lacking, mostly because the paucity of minerals that can be easily and accurately dated. Voluminous intrusive rocks are present in the ASRRTZ, with ages ranging from Early Paleozoic to Cenozoic. Among these, the Cenozoic intrusive rocks consists of two types of plutonic rocks, i.e. the high potassium alkaline and the calc-alkaline intrusions: (1) The high potassium alkaline rocks can be observed both within and outside the Ailaoshan-Honghe shear zone and occur as stocks or dikes. They are intruded between 41\u00a0Ma and 32\u00a0Ma (Chung et al., 1997; Liang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2003, 2001; Zhang and Xie, 1997) and are commonly associated with porphyry Cu\u2013Mo\u2013Au systems (Bi et al., 1999; Deng et al., 2014b; Hou et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2017). (2) Calc-alkaline intrusions mainly occur as small dikes within the Ailaoshan-Honghe shear zone. They were grouped primarily into pre-, syn- and post-kinematic dikes based on their crosscutting relationships with the mylonitic foliations and intruded later than ca. 28\u00a0Ma (Liu et al., 2015; Searle, 2006; Searle et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2013). The ages of some of the deposits have been estimated where it has been possible to establish a close genetic association between the intrusions and Au mineralization (He et al., 2015; Hou et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\nThe Habo Au polymetallic deposit is located in the Huangcaoling area, southern ASRRTZ (Figs. 1, 2\n). Exposed rocks in the area mainly include the Paleozoic to Triassic sedimentary rocks and the Habo granite complex. NW-trending faults, i.e., Huangcaoling, Dapaishan and Oumei faults, are secondary thrust faults of the regional Jiajiu-Mojiang fault. The NE-trending faults crosscut the orebodies. The Habo South granite complex intruded in the south. It consists mainly of granite, three mineralization-related monzogranite porphyries and a post-mineralization diorite porphyry (Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b). The granite is pink, coarse- to medium-grained, shows massive structure and granitic texture, and consists of quartz (40%), K-feldspar (45%), hornblende (5%) and biotite (10%). It is intruded by monzogranite porphyries, which are almost concealed. LA-ICP-MS zircon U\u2013Pb dating indicate that the granite were formed at 35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma while the three monzogranite porphyries yielded similar ages of ca. 36.0\u00a0Ma, respectively (Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b). The granite, monzogranite porphyries and the aplite dikes share similar geochemical characters (e.g., alkaline, high K2O contents, enrichments of LREE and LILEs, similar REE patterns, high Sr and low Y concentrations), thus, were probably originated from a similar source region or may have been generated from the same magma chamber (Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b; Zhu, 2010). Alteration mineral mapping indicates a zonation pattern from the monzogranite porphyries outward: a core of intense potassic alteration, characterized by intense K-feldspar alteration with dense quartz vein stockworks, to an intense potassic zone, to a moderate potassic and feldspar-destructive alteration zone, to an outer sericite alteration zone containing rare disseminated pyrite (Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b; Zhu, 2010). Based on these geological characters, Zhu (2010) further proposed that the monzogranite porphyries are ore-forming intrusions for the Habo Cu\u2013Mo\u2013Au deposit while the aplite dike in the area represents a later fine-grained intrusive facies. Numerous Cu-Mo, Au and Pb-Zn deposits\/occurrences are distributed in the area, constitute an ore district. On the whole, the metal suite exhibits a zonation around the Habo granite complex: the Cu\u2013Mo\u2013Au mineralization is situated near the monzogranite porphyries in the center of the complex, with Au mineralization located in the NW-trending fault zones on the periphery of the complex while the Zn-Pb mineralization mainly occur in an distal outer zone. Lamprophyre dikes are generally green and intruded into the sedimentary rocks and granite stock.\nIn the Habo Au polymetallic deposit, the main exposed rocks are the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Fig. 3\n). They have undergone greenschist-facies metamorphism and consist of marble, meta-siltstone and slate. The Triassic sedimentary rocks are rarely exposed in the northeast and mainly contain the Waigucun Formation sandstone. The Paleozoic meta-siltstone are the main host to the ores. They are\u00a0>\u00a0300\u00a0m thick, generally strike NW and dip S at 27\u00b0 to 67\u00b0. The major faults in the deposit have NW and NE strikes. NW-trending faults also striking NW and dipping SW at 30\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. More than ten aplite dikes were intruded into the mine and can be traced for 20\u2013100\u00a0m, with width of 0.5\u00a0m\u201330\u00a0m (Fig. 3). They are massive, exhibit fine-grained sugary texture. Some of them are intruded into the NW-trending fault, underwent strong sericite\u2013pyrite alteration and contain quartz\u2013galena veinlets (Fig. 4\n). Granites, as part of the Habo granite complex, are also intruded in, and extended out the mine. Three major orebodies have been identified in the deposit, with Au ore reserve of 485 kt @ 5.31\u00a0g\/t (304 Brigade of Hunan Nuclear Geology, 2010). The Pb-Zn ore reserve of the deposit is still unknown, although the Pb\u2013Zn ore has been mined for more than five years and is still mining at present. Orebodies are lenticular and\/ or veined, and emplaced parallel to the NW-trending fault zone. Among these, the NO. I orebodies is the largest one and also the only one currently being mined. It strikes NW, dips SW at 26\u00b0 to 81\u00b0, and has strike length of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0600\u00a0m, with an average width of 3.9\u00a0m. Ores in the deposit are mainly disseminated (Fig. 5\na), massive (Fig. 5b), veined (Fig. 5c) and brecciated (Fig. 5d). In the brecciated ores, the breccia are mainly aplite fragments, which commonly altered by sericite and cemented by the quartz sulfide veins. Metallic minerals include pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite (Fig. 6\n a-f). Gangue minerals include quartz, calcite, dolomite, sericite and feldspar. Hydrothermal alterations mainly include silicic, sericite, pyrite and carbonate alterations (Zhao et al., 2009). Silicic and pyrite alterations are intense in the phyllite around the orebodies. In addition, hematite is formed by oxidation of pyrite in surface.\nThree hydrothermal alteration-mineralization stages (I, II, III) can be identified based on field investigations, hand-specimen and thin section petrographic observations: Stage I mainly comprises quartz-pyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite veins crosscutting or along the foliations of the wall rocks (Fig. 5c, 6a, b). Sericite alterations are generally concentrated in halos that are distributed symmetrically on the two sides of the quartz-pyrite veins (Fig. 6a). Feldspars in aplite dikes and siltstone have been replaced by sericite and quartz, with minor pyrite (Fig. 6c, d). Pyrite (Py1) are distributed in sedimentary wall rocks and aplite, occurs as euhedral fine-grained isolated crystals or coarse-grained crystals within quartz veins. Py1 in aplite commonly contains abundant silicate mineral (e.g., sericite and quartz) inclusions (Fig. 6b) and brittle fractured (Fig. 6g). Stage II is characterized by quartz-polysulfide\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0calcite veins, which crosscut stage I quartz-pyrite vein (Fig. 5). Sulfides include sphalerite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, tetrahedrite and pyrite (Py2, Fig. 6h, i). They commonly replace Py1 (Fig. 6f, g). Minor pyrite occur within along fractures that crosscut the Stage I quartz veins, or as overgrowth on Py1 (Fig. 6j). Py2 commonly contains arsenopyrite and galena inclusions (Fig. 6k, l). The alteration associated with the Stage II veins includes an assemblage of quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0calcite, was closely related to sulfide deposition, particularly the massive ores. Stage III comprises calcite-quartz veins crosscutting previous mineralization (Fig. 5b). Detailed mineralization paragenesis at the Habo deposit is shown in Fig. 7\n.\n\n\n4\nSampling and methodology\n\n4.1\nZircon U\u2013Pb and mica 40Ar\/39Ar dating\nThe aplite samples near the NO. I orebody were crushed into 80\u2013120 mesh, washed and dried. Zircons were separated using conventional heavy liquid and magnetic separation techniques. These zircons with good crystal shape and without cracks were handpicked under a binocular microscope, mounted in epoxy resin and polished to about half their thickness. They were imaged under transmission light and then with cathodoluminescence (CL) to select the spots for the analyses. The selected zircons were analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) at the Guangdong Provincal Key Lab of Geodynamics and Geohazards, Sun Yat-sen University. Laser ablation was carried out using a GeoLas 200\u00a0M system (with 20\u00a0\u03bcm beam diameter and 10\u00a0Hz frequency) coupled with an Agilent 7500a ICP-MS. The Standard SRM610 was used as external standard and 29Si was used as internal standard. Zircon 91,500 was used as external standard for U\u2013Pb dating. The analytical uncertainty for the Zircon 91,500 in this study was <2%. Detailed operating conditions for the laser ablation system and the ICP-MS instrument and data reduction were similar to those of described by Liu et al. (2008). Time-drift correction and quantitative calibration for trace element analyses and U\u2013Pb dating were performed by Glitter (Version 4.0), and the data were reported with a precision better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u03c3. Concordia diagrams and weighted mean age calculations were made by using Isoplot\/Ex_ver3 (Ludwig, 2003). Weighted mean ages for pooled U\u2013Pb analyses were quoted with 95% confidence interval.\nSericite in altered-siltstone from the Habo deposit was collected for 40Ar\/39Ar dating. The siltstone was cut by Stage I quartz-pyrite veins, accompanied by intense sericite alteration (Fig.). The sample was crushed to\u00a0<\u00a020-mesh, from which the mica flakes were separated using conventional heavy liquid and magnetic separation techniques. The mica samples were ultrasonic cleaned, and then handpicked under a binocular microscope to ensure\u00a0>\u00a099% purity. Step-heating 40Ar\/39Ar measurements were carried out using the MM-1200 and GV Instruments 5400 mass spectrometer at the Ar\u2013Ar Laboratory of Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Detailed analytical techniques for the MM-1200 and GV-5400 instruments were similar to those described by Qiu and Wijbrans (2008). The 40Ar\/39Ar results were calculated and plotted using the ArArCALC software (Koppers, 2002), and the 40Ar\/39Ar ages were determined using the decay constants of Steiger and J\u00e4ger (1977). The age uncertainties are reported at 95% confidence level (2\u03c3). The heating plateau ages were defined by Fleck et al. (1977) and incorporate at least two steps corresponding to no<50% of the total 39Ar released, the ages of which are within 2\u03c3 of the mean value and were calculated by weighing with inverse variance.\n\n\n4.2\nIn situ trace elemental analysis\nAnalytical instrumentation employed in this study consists of a NewWave UP-213\u00a0nm Laser Ablation System coupled with an Thermo Element II ICP-MS at National Geological Testing Center, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. Depending on the pyrite size, analyses were performed by laser-ablating spot diameters of 10\u201335\u00a0\u03bcm and at repetition rate of 2\u20135\u00a0Hz. The laser beam energy was maintained between 2.3 and 2.5\u00a0J\/cm2. Analysis time for each sample was 90\u00a0s, which includes 30\u00a0s of background measurement with laser off and 60\u00a0s of analysis with laser on. Acquisition time for all masses was set to 0.02\u00a0s, with a total sweep time of\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.6\u00a0s. The following elements were measured: Al, Si, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Zr, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, La, Au, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th and U. Data quantification used the internal standard method, with Fe used as the internal standard. Calibration was performed using the USGS standard sample (MASS-1). The standard was analyzed twice every 1.5\u00a0h to account for the instrument drift, with a 100-\u03bcm beam at 10\u00a0Hz.\n\n\n4.3\nIn situ S\u2013Pb analysis\nSulfide ore samples were collected both from the mining ore bodies. Twenty-one polished thin sections of sulfide ores were used for fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS in situ S and Pb isotopic analyses. The surface of the polished thin sections was cleaned with milli-Q water (18.2 M\u03a9\u00b7cm). In situ S\u2013Pb isotope were analyzed at the State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Northwest University. A 266\u00a0nm NWR UP Femto (Electro Scientific Industries, Inc., USA) femtosecond laser ablation system was used as the ablation source for in situ analysis. A JEOL JXA-8230 electron probe with 15\u00a0kV acceleration voltage, 20nA beam current, 2\u00a0mm beam size and 30\u00a0ms cumulative time for each point was used for back-scattered electron images.\nFor S analysis: Laser ablation parameters were: laser ablation mode, single spot; spot size, 20\u201337\u00a0\u03bcm; laser frequency, 3\u20134\u00a0Hz; energy density, 3.5\u20134.0\u00a0J\/cm2; and carrier gas, 0.28\u00a0L\/min He. Isotopic measurements were performed using a Nu Plasma 1700 MC-ICP-MS (Nu instruments, UK) equipped with sixteen Faraday cups and three ion counters. Cup configurations for sulfur were H5 cup for 34S, Ax cup for 33S, and L4 cup for 32S. Time-resolved software data acquisition mode with an integration time of 0.2\u00a0s was used to collect and integrate signals introduced by laser ablation. Each sample acquisition consisted of background collection for 30\u00a0s, followed by ablation signal collection for 70\u00a0s, and a wash time of 50\u00a0s to reduce memory effects. International standards included IAEA-S-1, IAEA-S-2, IAEA-S-3 (Ag2S), and internal standards included NBS123 (sphalerite, \u03b434SV-CDT\u00a0=\u00a017.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 \u2030, 2SD), Py-4 (pyrite, \u03b434SV-CDT\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 \u2030, 2SD), CBI-3 (galena, \u03b434SV-CDT\u00a0=\u00a028.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 \u2030, 2SD). The analytical precision calculated from replicate analyses of unknown samples is better than 0.2\u2030 (1\u03c3). Details of instrument parameters and in situ S isotope analysis techniques were described in Bao et al. (2016).\nFor Pb analysis: Line scan ablation consisted of background collection for 20\u00a0s followed by 50\u00a0s of laser ablation for signal collection. Laser ablation parameters were: 15\u00a0\u03bcm spot size for galena; 100% output energy, N600 \u03bcJ; 100% energy density, 6\u00a0J\/cm2; laser frequency, 5\u201350\u00a0Hz; and ablation way, line 3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. These ensured a strong enough Pb signal for the in situ analysis of pyrite and arsenopyrite samples. Isotopic measurements were performed using a Nu Plasma II MC-ICP-MS (Nu instruments, UK) equipped with sixteen Faraday cups and five ion counters. The Tl (20\u00a0ppb), NIST SRM 997 (205Tl\/203Tl\u00a0=\u00a02.38890) and NIST SRM 610 glass served as internal and external standards. The repeated analyses of NIST SRM 610 glass yielded highly reliable and reproducible results during the whole analytical process with mean 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.052\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.515\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003 and 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a036.980\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.007 (1\u00a0s, n\u00a0=\u00a050). Details of instrument parameters and fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS in situ Pb isotope analyses were described in Yuan et al. (2015).\n\n\n\n5\nAnalytical results\n\n5.1\nZircon U\u2013Pb and mica 40Ar\/39Ar dating\nThe zircon U\u2013Pb dating results are listed in Table 1\n. The zircons (50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm long with aspect ratios of 1:1 to 2:1) are colorless, transparent and euhedral, and display typical oscillatory zonation (Fig. 8\n). Analyzed zircon grains contain Th and U concentrations of 125\u20134850\u00a0ppm and 99.6\u20136343\u00a0ppm, respectively, with Th\/U ratios of 0.67\u20133.06 (Table 1). After discarding four captured zircons with ages of 2127\u00a0Ma, 1837\u00a0\u00a0Ma, 456\u00a0Ma and 139\u00a0Ma and one zircon with low concordance, ten zircons yielded a weighted mean 206U\/238Pb age of 35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a03.5) (Fig. 8), representing the intrusive age of the aplite.\n\n40Ar\/39Ar dating result of sericite in pyritized siltstone are listed in Table 2\n, and the corresponding plateau ages and isochron ages are plotted in Fig. 9\n. The 40Ar\/39Ar plateau age of the spectra is defined by: (1) at least eight contiguous steps of all the gas released from the sample, and (2) their apparent ages in agreement with the integrated age of the plateau segment with invariability at the 2\u03c3 level of uncertainty. Sericite in pyritized siltstone yielded a plateau age of 37.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma, with\u00a0>\u00a090% released gas (Fig. 9). The isochron age and inverse isochron age are 37.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9\u00a0Ma and 32.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0Ma, with the initial 40Ar\/36Ar values of 250 and 536, respectively, representing the mineralizing age of the Habo deposit.\n\n\n5.2\nTrace element of pyrite\nThe trace element compositions of pyrite of different stages (Py1 and Py2) are listed in Table 3\n and are shown in Fig. 10\n.\nPy1 composition: LA-ICP-MS data reveal that Py1 have high Ni and Co concentrations of 0.40\u20131863\u00a0ppm and\u00a0<\u00a02.70\u20131133\u00a0ppm, respectively, with Co\/Ni ratios of 0.08\u20137.67 (Fig. 10a, b). The Au contents vary from 0.02 to 5\u00a0ppm and the As contents vary from 18.5 to 8667\u00a0ppm (Fig. 10c). They have\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0ppm (median and mean) concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ag and Pb, and\u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0ppm (median and mean) concentrations of Se.\nPy2 composition: Py2 have significantly lower Ni and Co concentrations (0.05\u2013183\u00a0ppm, 0.04\u201378.1\u00a0ppm, respectively) compared to Py1 (Table 3). The Au contents of Py2 range from 0.08 to 16.6\u00a0ppm, and the As contents range from 655 to 17647\u00a0ppm. They have Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations an order of magnitude higher than Py1 (Fig. 10d).\n\n\n5.3\nIn situ S\u2013Pb isotopic composition\nIn situ \u03b434S values of sulfides from the Habo deposit are presented in Table 4\n and are shown in Figs. 11 and 12\n\n. In situ \u03b434S values of sulfides from Habo show a narrow range from \u20135.1\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a02.5\u2030. Stage I pyrite have relatively \u03b434S values ranging from \u20131.7\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a02.5\u2030 while stage II sulfide have \u03b434S values of \u22125.1\u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a00.1\u2030. Moreover, \u03b434S values for stage II pyrite, sphalerite and galena are \u20131.1\u2030 to\u20130.5\u2030, \u20132.0\u2030 to \u20130.8\u2030 and \u20135.1\u2030 to \u20137.7\u2030, respectively. The \u03b434S values of stage II sulfide decrease in the order of pyrite\u00a0>\u00a0sphalerite\u00a0>\u00a0galena, which is consistent with the experimentally determined equilibrium sulfur isotope fractionation factors for 32S and 34S between the fluid and sulfide minerals and likely implies contemporaneous deposition of these sulfides (Seal, 2006).\nIn situ Pb isotopic ratios of galena are listed in Table 5\n and are shown in Fig. 13\n. Stage II galena crystals have in situ 206Pb\/204Pb ratios of 18.683\u201318.691, 207Pb\/204Pb ratios of 15.636\u201315.645 and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios of 38.789\u201338.821.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nAge and tectonic setting of the mineralization\nThe aplite at Habo yielded zircon U\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Pb ages of 35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0Ma while the sericite (Stage I) from altered siltstone yielded an Ar-Ar age of 37.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma. Taken the testing precision into account, the zircon U\u2013Pb age of the Habo aplite is consistent with both the sericite Ar\u2013Ar plateau age for Au mineralization in this study. These ages are also similar to those of the granite and monzogranite porphyry in the Habo South granite complex (Fig. 14\n), which were yielded zircon U\u2013Pb ages of 35.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma and 36.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0Ma, respectively (Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b). Moreover, molybdenite from the Habo Cu\u2013Mo deposit also yielded similar Re\u2013Os ages of ca. 35.5\u00a0Ma and the monzogranite porphyry was considered to be responsible for the Cu\u2013Mo mineralization at the Habo Cu\u2013Mo deposit (Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b). All these geochronological data indicate that there is a temporal and genetic relationship between the mineralization and Eocene magmatic event. This magmatic event produced the Habo South granite complex in the south, including the Cu-Mo-Cu-mineralized monzogranite porphyry, which we speculate is genetically related to the Habo Au mineralization. Contemporary magmatic and metallogenic activities in the ASRRTZ and adjacent area are quite common (Fig. 13, Lu et al., 2013b; Wang et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhang and Xie, 1997). The southern part of the Ailaoshan\u2013Honghe alkali igneous rock belt is spatially coincided with the Ailaoshan Au belt. Numerous alkaline volcanic and intrusive rocks with ages ranging from 40 to 32\u00a0Ma are distributed in the area (Chung et al., 2005, 1998; Turner et al., 1996) and commonly associated with porphyry Cu\u2013Mo\u2013Au systems (Deng et al., 2014b, 2014a; Hou et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2013a, Lu et al., 2012). These rocks postdated the Asia-India collision at about 60\u201355\u00a0Ma. Therefore, the Habo mineralization is spatially and temporally consistent with regional magmatism and formed in an post-collisional intracontinental setting at ca. 36\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n6.2\nSource of ore-forming fluids and metals\n\n6.2.1\nSource of ore-forming fluids\nIn-situ sulfur isotopic analyses indicate that the \u03b434S values of sulfide from Habo range from\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.1 to\u00a0+\u00a02.5\u2030, with an average of \u22121.3\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a029). Sulfides are dominated by pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite and galena with minor pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite. Given the low temperature (174\u2013363\u00a0\u00b0C, unpublished data), low fO2 (absence of magnetite and hematite, Ohmoto, 1972) of hydrothermal fluids, the sulfur isotopic signature of sulfide could represent the bulk sulfur isotopic composition of ore-forming fluids (Ohmoto 1972). The narrow range and similarities of the sulfur isotopic compositions among Py1 and Py2 indicate that the multiple pulses of hydrothermal fluids were likely derived from a common reservoir. In a histogram of sulfur isotopic data (Fig. 12), the data cluster in a concentrated range of \u03b434S values, which coincide closely with the distribution of previously determined \u03b434S data for magmatic ore fluids (Simon and Ripley, 2011). Previously published sulfur isotopic data for sulfide minerals from the adjacent porphyry deposits, including the Beiya Au, Machangqing Cu\u2013Mo\u2013Au, Tongchang Cu\u2013Mo and Habo Cu\u2013Mo deposits, also yielded similar \u03b434S values of\u00a0\u2212\u00a05 to\u00a0+\u00a05\u2030. Thus, \u03b434S values of sulfides at Habo are consistent with those \u03b434S values for sulfide minerals in these magmatic hydrothermal deposits (Fig. 12), also suggesting that the ore-forming fluids for these deposits are likely originated from similar magmatic sources.\n\n\n6.2.2\nSource of metals\nDue to the extremely low U and Th concentrations, the radiogenic Pb isotopes of sulfides are negligible relative to common Pb isotopes. Therefore, Pb isotopic ratios of galena from the Habo deposit can reflect those of hydrothermal fluids. The Pb isotopic compositions of the sulfides from Habo are compared with corresponding data for Eocene granitoids in the deposit, as well as for Eocene magmatic rocks and sulfides from numerous magmatic-hydrothermal and orogenic-type Au deposits in adjacent areas. Although existing complex emplacement relationships, the Habo South granite, monzogranite porphyries and the aplite dikes have similar geochemical characters and probably have been generated from similar sources or same magma chamber as mentioned above. Thus, the isotopic data Habo granite reported by Tran et al. (2014) are used to represent those for the Eocene granitoids in the Habo deposits. As shown in Fig. 13, Pb isotopic compositions of galena from the Habo deposit are very similar to those of the magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits in the adjacent area, suggesting that the Habo Au mineralization and these deposits shared a common source for their metals. Moreover, the Pb isotope ratios of the galena from the Habo deposit closely match those of the Habo South granite. This implies that the Pb and other metals (e.g., Au, Mo and Zn) were probably originated from the Eocene granitoids (e.g., the mineralized monzogranite porphyry). On the contrast, the distinct differences between the Pb isotope ratios of the Habo galena and those of the other stratigraphic units in the adjacent area (e.g., Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata), demonstrate that these stratigraphic units did not significantly contribute to the ore metal budget.\n\n\n\n6.3\nGenesis of the Habo Au polymetallic deposit\nThe Habo Au polymetallic deposit is hosted by the Early Paleozoic low-grade metamorphic clastic rocks. Au mineralization occurs at the NW fault zones near the alkaline Habo granite complex. Ore structures are mainly disseminated, massive, veined and brecciated. Sulfide stockworks and brecciated ores formed by filling of open spaces (non-orientational) are common. Lack of directional sulfide stockworks, which generally occurs in typical orogenic-type Au deposit (Chen, 2010; Chen et al., 2007a, 2007b; Chen and Fu, 1992; Chen and Li, 2009). Three major alteration-mineralization stages (I, II, III) can be identified: quartz-pyrite (I), quartz-polysulfide (II) and calcite-quartz (III). Temporally, the Au polymetallic mineralization at Habo is coeval with the emplacement of the monzogranite porphyries. Spatially, the Habo Au polymetallic mineralization, together with the Habo Cu\u2013Mo\u2013Au mineralization and the Zn-Pb occurrences nearby, forms a mineralization zonation pattern around the Habo monzogranite porphyries. The S\u2013Pb isotopic compositions of sulfides from the Habo deposit indicate that the Habo granite was probably responsible for the Au polymetallic mineralization at Habo. Above all geological and geochemical characters (i.e., ore and gangue mineral assemblages, ore structures and paragenesis, mineralization zonation pattern, mineralization structurally controlled by faults, a magmatic source for the fluids and metal, and a close genetic association with porphyry systems) are similar to typical intrusion-related vein-type deposits, such as those deposits in the Central City district, Colorado, USA (Alford et al., 2020), zoned mineralization in the Morococha District, Peru (Catchpole et al., 2015), and Yinjiagou deposit in North China (Chen and Fu, 1992; Chen and Guo, 1993; Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b). Therefore, the Habo Au polymetallic mineralization is best attributed to be vein-type deposit. A model that explains the genesis of the Habo Au deposit is shown in Fig. 14. In the model, the Eocene magmatic rocks was intruded in two phases (early coarse-grained Habo South granite and late monzogranite porphyry), the second of which exsolved a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid. Both the ore-forming fluid and metals (i.e., Au, Pb, and Zn) were sourced from the monzogranite porphyry. The metals and sulfur were transported by the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid along, and finally deposited in preexisting NW-trending fault.\n\n\n6.4\nImplications for Au occurrence and distribution in intrusion-related systems\nThere is a strong positive Au\u2013As correlation in pyrite from the Habo deposit (Fig. 8). This positive correlation of As and Au has been recognized in some other ore deposits (Deditius et al., 2014; Fleet et al., 1993; Large et al., 2009; Reich et al., 2005). Reich et al. (2005) identified a strong positive Au-As correlation in pyrite from Carlin-type and epithermal ore deposits and determined that the maximum amount of Au that can be contained within the pyrite lattice depends on the As content. They defined the empirical solid solubility of Au in As-bearing pyrite as CAu\u00a0=\u00a00.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CAs\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 (Reich et al., 2005), which could be illustrated as an Au-saturation line on an Au vs. As plot. In the Au vs. As diagram, all the pyrite data from this study plot below the Au-saturation line of Reich et al. (2005), implying that Au is contained within the crystal lattice of the pyrite or as nanoinclusions (<250\u00a0nm, Cook and Chryssoulis, 1990). Pyrite grains with high As concentrations (i.e., >500\u00a0ppm As) are common in hydrothermal ore deposits, particularly epithermal and Carlin-type Au deposits, which supports a common opinion that As-rich sulfides play a role in scavenging Au+ (Cline et al., 2005; Deditius et al., 2014; Fleet et al., 1993; Large et al., 2009; Reich et al., 2005). Thus, the high As\/Au ratios of pyrite at Habo suggests that the As-rich ore-forming fluids were largely unsaturated with respect to Au0.\nAu in intrusion-related vein-type deposits was commonly regarded as visible gold (Kesler et al., 2002; Robert et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2020). However, both latest studies on some Au deposits in the Jiaodong gold province (Heilan\u2019gou gold deposit, Feng et al., 2018; Zhuangzi Au deposit, Li et al., 2018) and the Habo Au polymetallic deposit in this study largely confirm the significance of invisible Au in these intrusion-related systems. Thus, Au occurrence and distribution in intrusion-related systems is largely related to the chemical compositions of ore-forming fluids. An As-rich or Te-rich fluids (Bi et al., 2011; Keith et al., 2020) could scavenger and transport more Au. And ore fluids with high Au\/As and Au\/Te ratios tend to participate invisible Au in the lattice of pyrite.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe Habo Au polymetallic deposit is an intrusion-related vein-type deposit formed in an post-collisional intracontinental setting at ca. 36\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n(2)\nOre fluids and metals for the Habo Au polymetallic deposit are originated from the Habo granite complex.\n\n\n(3)\nAu in the Habo deposit are invisible gold.\n\n\n\n\n","60":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSandstone-type uranium deposits account for nearly half of the total uranium reserve in the world (Cumberland et al., 2016) and are one of most import uranium resources in China (Hu et al., 2008). The in-situ leach technique led to an exploration climax for sandstone-hosted uranium deposits in North China (Xu et al., 2012), and many important sandstone-hosted uranium deposits have been discovered in the Songliao basin, Yili basin, and Ordos Basin in North China (Bonnetti et al., 2017; Xi et al., 2015). The Ordos Basin is one of the biggest uranium resource areas in China and uranium exploration have discovered a series of sandstone-type uranium deposits in recent years, which show that the basin has good prospecting potential (Liu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2020). The largest sandstone-hosted uranium deposit of China was found in the northern part of the basin and the middle Jurassic Zhiluo Formation is the major ore-hosting horizon (Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). However, in the last two years, the uranium exploration discovered that the economically significant uranium orebodies occurred in the lower Cretaceous Luohe Formation in the southwestern part of the basin (Miao et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). The breakthrough of exploration on sandstone-type uranium deposits in Luohe Formation has gained great attention. The distribution and properties of ore controlling structures in Luohe Formation, as the new exploration strata, are not yet clear. Geophysical techniques have played a major role in ore controlling structure and been applied broadly in uranium exploration around the world (Biswas, et al., 2014; Darijani et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020). The methods of combining radiometric and electromagnetic measurements with seismic exploration in uranium exploration projects reduced the exploration risks in the Rancheria sub-basin, Colombia (Sonia et al., 2018). Isostatic residual gravity anomalies were applied to define the location and shape of the basement controlling the structures of the uranium deposits (Blakely and Jachens, 1991; Mwenifumbo et al., 2004). Mandal et al. (2015) establishes the geophysical signatures for uranium mineralization as low-gravity, moderate-to-high magnetic, and low-resistivity values in the Beldih open cast mine in Eastern India. The gravity is mostly used to identify the structural framework and fault distribution of uranium deposits (Ning et al., 2020), while failed in the detailed recognition of geologic features at depth. Especially, Luohe Formation is at >700\u00a0m depth, deeper than uranium-bearing stones in uranium-bearing basins in northern China (Zhang et al., 2018). High\u2010resolution seismic data were applied to map the strata and structure controlling the uranium district in the Gas Hills (Applegate et al., 1982). There are several successful cases of the uranium exploration using seismic methods in the Songliao, Ordos, and Erlian basins, China (Tan et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018). Seismic methods are often used to interpret the strata of uranium deposits and identify ore-controlling structures. And seismic impedance is used to predict ore-bearing sandstones in uranium deposits (Wood et al., 2012). The seismic impedance inversion and attributes were employed to identify uranium-bearing deposits from surrounding rocks, while the result deciphered the correlation between the acoustic impedance and gamma intensity (Hajnal et al., 2020). 3-D seismic method is able to provide high-resolution images for the ore-controlling structures, while it is still not a standard component of the uranium exploration approach, due to its expensive cost (Wood et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2020). The gravity and magnetic methods are cheap and effective, while the unconstrained density inversion has the multi-solution problem. 3-D density inversion with the constraint of surface geological condition or the well data reduced the multiple solution problem (Roy et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019). However, its accuracy is limited to the shallow and the well. The gravity inversion with the constraint of high-resolution seismic data can solve this problem. The joint inversion of 2D seismic and gravity profiling data has obtained some good exploration results in exploring uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin in Canada (Darijani et al., 2019). However, it\u2019s necessary to invert 3-D geophysical data for accurate delineation of structures and faults controlling the uranium-bearing deposits. We applied the constrained inversion of seismic and gravity data to describe 3-D geological structures of the uranium-bearing sandstones of the Luohe Formation and identify uranium-bearing deposits from surrounding rocks.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and uranium deposits\nThe Ordos Basin is located in the western part of the North China, which is a multi-cycle superimposed basin, bounded by Yinshan Mountain to the north, Helan Mountain and Liupan Mountain to the west, Luliang Mountain to the east, and Qinling Mountain to the south (Wang, 2011). The Ordos Basin is divided into six tectonic units: Yimeng uplift, Weibei uplift, Jinxi flexural fold belt, Yishan slope, Tianhuan depression, and Western Margin overthrust belt (Zhao et al., 2012). The study area is located in the southern part of the Tianhuan Depression and the Western Margin overthrust belt. The Tianhuan Depression is located in western Ordos Basin, which is an asymmetric syncline with steep west wing and gentle east wing, and distributed in the NS-trend. The Western Margin overthrust belt is adjacent to the Tianhuan syncline in the east, and is controlled by a series of west-dipping large thrust faults, and its tectonic line strikes nearly north\u2013south (Wang, 2011). The basin basement is a part of the North China Craton, mainly composed of Archean granulite facies, amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks and migmatitic granite, Paleoproterozoic amphibolite facies and greenschist facies metamorphic rocks (Zhai, 2011). The basement structure is mainly composed of alternative uplift and depression with NE-trend in the early stage, superimposed by N-S trending central paleo-uplift in the last stage (Guo et al., 2019). The tectonic evolution of sedimentary cover is inherited from the basement structure. The basement faults in Ordos Basin are mainly NE trending, and NW trending faults are developed in the western Ordos Basin (Li et al., 2012). The two groups of faults control the uplift of the basement and the deposition of the sedimentary cover. The sedimentary cover developed in a relatively complete age, except that the missing formation is the Silurian, Devonian, Lower Carboniferous and Upper Cretaceous (Yang, 2002). The Early Paleozoic succession consists of marine carbonate platform sediments and the Late Paleozoic succession consists of marine and terrestrial sediments. In the Late Triassic, the basin changed from a platform setting to an intra-cratonic setting. The Mesozoic succession is made up of the clastic sediments of fluvial facies, delta facies and lacustrine facies (Yang et al., 2004). Uranium mineralization zones are widely distributed in Ordos Basin, mainly located at the margin of the basin (Fig. 1\n). A number of large sandstone-type uranium deposits were discovered in the northeastern Ordos Basin, such as the Dongsheng area (Akhtar et al., 2017). Some medium and small sandstone-type uranium deposits were discovered in the western Ordos Basin, such as the Ningdong area (Wang et al., 2018). Several large sandstone-type uranium deposits were discovered in the southeastern Ordos Basin, such as the Diantou area and Shuanglong area (Xu et al., 2020). The mineralized layer of the above deposits is mainly the middle Jurassic Zhiluo Formation. The Guojiawan uranium deposit is a medium and small sandstone-type uranium deposit, which was discovered in the southwestern part of the Ordos Basin (Xue et al., 2010). The Pengyang uranium deposit is a new large sandstone-type uranium deposit which was discovered in the southwestern part of the Ordos Basin (Duan and Zhang, 2019).\nThe main uranium-bearing strata in Ordos Basin are some Mesozoic strata, such as the Zhiluo Formation, the Yan\u2018an Formation. Some small-sized sandstone-hosted uranium deposits have been discovered in the Cretaceous strata, mainly distributed in the central and western part of the basin (Wang et al., 2018). In the Late Cretaceous, the basin was uplifted and sedimentation was missing. The lower Cretaceous strata can be divided into the Luohe, the Huanhe\u2013Huachi, the Luohandong, and the Jingchuan formations (Fig. 2\n). And the Luohe Formation is the target strata of this study and widely distributed throughout the basin, which is divied into the lower, middle and upper units. The upper unit consists of a set of reddish-brown sandstone which contains gravelly coarse sandstone and glutenite. The middle unit consists of light yellow\u2013brown sandstone with light red sandstone and blue-gray mudstone. The lower unit consists of light gray sandstone and blue-gray mudstone. The ore-bearing sandstones are mostly located in the light gray medium-fine sandstone with cross-bedding, slab bedding and wavy bedding (Zhu et al., 2018; Qiao et al., 2020). The Luohe Formation is dominated by an aeolian sedimentary system with large-scale aeolian sand, dry valley, and desert lacustrine deposits (Yang, 2006). The interface stratum between the Luohe Formation and the overlying the Huanhe\u2013Huachi Formation is a set of gravel-bearing coarse sandstone which formed a roof impermeable layer. The floor impermeable layer is composed of sandstone, glutenite, siltstone and mudstone. The floor and roof constitute a relatively closed metallogenic environment for uranium deposits.\nThe Ordos Basin has undergone four major tectonic events, Hercynian Movement, Indosinian movement, Yanshanian Movement, and Himalayas Movement (Liu et al., 2006). In the Yanshanian period, the stress field in the area surrounding the Ordos Basin is mainly the NW-SE compression stress which was related to the expansion of the Tethys ocean and the northwest subduction of the Kula plate (Zhang et al., 2006). Strong intracontinental deformations developed and thrust-nappe occurred in the southwestern part of the basin. In the Early Cretaceous, the basin was in a weakly extension environment and the whole area in Ordos Basin changed to uplift and missed deposits in the Late Cretaceous (Xu et al., 2006). In the Himalaya period, the stress field in Ordos Basin became NE-SW compression stress and NW-SE extension which was related to the subduction collision between Indian and Asian plates and the roll-back subduction of the Pacific plate. (Zhang et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006). The faults of the southwestern basin are composed of the N-S trending thrust faults, E-W and NE-right-lateral strike-slip faults (Xu et al., 2019). In the west of the study area, the NS-trending Qingtongxia-Guyuan fault is the boundary fault of the Western Margin overthrust belt and the Liupan Mountains (Fig. 1). In the east of the study area, the NS-trending Hui\u2018anpu-Shajingzi fault is the boundary fault of the Western Margin overthrust belt and the Tianhuan depression. In addition, the Qinglongshan-Pingliang fault is the boundary fault of the secondary structural unit of the Western Margin overthrust belt (Zhao, 2003).\n\n\n3\nProcessing and analysis of seismic data\n\n3.1\nProcessing of seismic datasets\nIn this research, the used seismic and well data were acquired by the oil and gas exploration of Changqing Oilfield in 1985\u20132000. The NS-trending seismic section of Line 1 crossing the Tianhuan Depression has a length of 68\u00a0km (Fig. 1a). Line 2 trending EW, crossing the Tianhuan Depression and the Western Margin overthrust belt, has a length of 87\u00a0km. The EW-trending Line 3 extended 20\u00a0km, crossing well K01. The EW-trending Line 4 extended 33\u00a0km, crossing well SD01, the Tianhuan Depression and the Western Margin overthrust belt. The seismic data are acquired using the explosive source, and the recording time is 6\u00a0s, and the sample interval is 1\u00a0ms. Standard oil-industry software CGG and ProMAX were used for data processing. Procedures included static correction, frequency analysis, energy analysis, disturbing wave analysis, prestack processing of noise attenuation; and processing of consistency, slalom line, dip moveout (DMO), and migration. The post-stack migration seismic profiles have low resolution images due to the surveying method and complicated surface condition (Sun et al., 2003), which is detrimental to data analysis and interpretation(Fig. 3\na). So, we applied the random noise attenuation and oblique interference filter to the migration seismic data (Lin et al., 1998) (Fig. 3b). The processed seismic profile is characterized by stronger and more balanced seismic energy, and the seismic phase axes are clearer and more continuous (Fig. 3c and d).\n\n\n3.2\nSynthetic seismic data\nThe seismic wavelet is important to model inversion and formation calibration. We obtained the seismic wavelet by using the statistics and the matching pursuit algorithms by iterations (Mallat and Zhang, 1993) until the residual satisfies the error requirement. The zero-phase wavelet was extracted from wells and the wavelet is stable, in which the energy is concentrated in the center and decreases rapidly to the side (Fig. 4\na and b). Next, we applied the calibration horizon on the seismic profile by well data. Synthetic and observed seismic sections (Line 1) are correlated to K01 borehole data. The blue seismic traces are the synthetic seismic calculated by sound wave and density data of logging. The red seismic traces are extracted from average seismic traces. There is good correspondence between variations in acoustic wave velocity and gamma to the synthetic and observed seismic traces. Compared with acoustic wave velocity in surrounding rocks, velocities of the uranium-bearing sandstones increase significantly.\n\n\n3.3\nSeismic attributes\nThe seismic attribute technology has been widely used in the exploration of petroleum and coal in Ordos Basin (Yang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). However, seismic attributes of uranium-bearing sandstones are unclear and need more research to the present day. Seismic attributes are related to the fundamental information in seismic data: time, amplitude, frequency, and attenuation (Brown, 2001). Amplitude attributes address problems of stratigraphy and reservoir properties. Frequency attributes can help identify abnormal attenuation and fracture zones detection. Therefore, the instantaneous frequency and the instantaneous amplitude were extracted from seismic data (Fig. 5\n). The instantaneous amplitude profile of Line 4 crossing well SD01 shows that the floor and roof of the ore-bearing strata are characterized by strong and continuous amplitude. The instantaneous amplitude represents the instantaneous change of seismic wave energy and thus characterizes the lithology interface. It indicates significant differences between sandstones in Luohe Formation and rocks in overlying and underlying strata (Fig. 5a). It is proved by drilling data that the Luohe Formation dominated by the aeolian sandstones is different from the overlying Hehuachi Formation with a set of gravel-bearing coarse sandstones and the underlying Yijun Formation with a set of conglomerates. The uranium-bearing sandstones are characterized by low seismic amplitude zone and less continuous amplitude axes, which is caused by the high porosity and developed fractures. The discontinuity or jump in the instantaneous amplitude are interpreted as faults, which are not identified in the migration seismic profile.\nThe instantaneous frequency profile of Line 4 crossing well SD01 shows that sandstones in the Luohe Formation are characterized by high to medium frequency band of 28\u201334\u00a0Hz (Fig. 5b), in which the relative low-frequency band of 15\u201320\u00a0Hz corresponds to the uranium-bearing sandstones. The high frequency component will be absorbed and the seismic energy attenuates sharply in high frequency when seismic waves propagate in the rocks with fractures. So, the uranium-bearing sandstones with low frequency absorbed high frequency due to developed fractures.\n\n\n3.4\nSeismic inversion\nGeneral seismic visualization and interpretation have been less successful in identification of thin beds due to the limited seismic frequency band and high frequency attenuation. Combining the high frequency band of logging data and the low frequency band of seismic data can effectively improve the problem. The post-stack inversion has been used as an effective tool for enhancing stratigraphic interpretation and describing the physical properties of rocks. To better delineate the uranium-bearing sandstones, we applied the acoustic impedance inversion of post-stack seismic and well data. The algorithm from well to seismic calibration modifies the impedance to achieve a good match between seismic and synthetic data that built from well logging data. Synthetic seismograms are used to match well-log quantities to seismic attributes for the impedance inversion. Then, we built the initial model (Fig. 5c) for the model-based inversion by using the acoustic impedance logs calculated at the well location. As the result of the seismic impedance inversion shown in Fig. 5d, the sandstone layers are characterized by intermittent impedance axes and medium\u2013low impedance. There is a relatively low impedance zone surrounding the high impedance zone, which interpreted as the uranium-bearing sandstones. However, for better delineation of 3-D geologic structures and depicting the uranium-bearing sandstones, it is necessary to acquire 3-D geophysical data. More geophysical means can help the uranium exploration; therefore, we used the gravity analysis and inversion.\n\n\n\n4\nProcessing and analysis of gravity datasets\n\n4.1\nProcessing of gravity datasets\nGravity data were acquired by Geological Survey Project from China Geological Survey with a scale of 1:250,000. The topographic correction has been made to the bouguer anomalies to obtain the complete bouguer anomalies(Fig. 2). The survey covers an area of 4,800\u00a0km2 and involves the Tianhuan Depression and the Western Margin overthrust belt. The study area is characterized by negative anomalies from \u2212148\u00a0mGal to \u2212196\u00a0mGal. Fig. 2 shows that the study area has gravity that is low in the eastern part, low in the northwest side of the basin, high across a NS-trending strip in the western part of the study area. There is a NS-tending steep gravity gradient from Pengyang to Pingliang. The lowest anomalies in the northeastern part are interpreted as the deposit center of the study area. The high anomalies in the western part are related to the stratigraphic thrust nappe. Although the bouguer anomaly can identify the structural outline and lithology of the basin, the detail geological features and distribution of various rock densities are difficult to be delineated due to the notorious reason that local anomaly is always hard separated from regional anomaly. The sedimentary strata of the study area are located in the sedimentary center of Odors Basin in the Cretaceous with the maximum thickness of \u223c1400\u00a0m (Yang, 2006). Considering the thin Cenozoic basin and the Lower Cretaceous strata locally exposed to the surface, the local and shallow geological structures and configuration of the basin are the point of this paper. The residual gravity anomaly is obtained from separation of the bouguer gravity anomaly by eliminating the regional gravity anomaly (Blakely and Simpson, 1986). We obtained the residual anomalies by a regional-residual separation of gravity field with the match filtering method (Spector and Grant, 1970). Fig. 6\na shows a gridded image of the residual gravity map. These gravity anomalies distinctively outlined faults and boundaries controlling the geological features. Residual anomalies in the western part are NS trending, which is coincident with bouguer anomalies. Residual anomalies in the eastern part emphasized the EW and NW trending structures, which are difficult to be identified in bouguer anomalies. However, the detailed features and subtle faults cannot be determined by the residual gravity anomalies. To enhance the lineaments and geological edges, many methods on\nhorizontal and vertical derivatives were proposed (Hsu et al., 1996; Verduzco et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2016a). We applied the spectral-moment method to the residual anomalies, which have good applications in the tectonic structures of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Central Asia (Sun et al., 2016b; Yang et al., 2015). The ridge coefficients map(Fig. 6b) shows that more faults and features are identified, and the NS-trending boundary interpreted as Huianbao-Shajingzi Fault between the Tianhuan Depression and the Western Margin overthrust belt is outlined. The NS-trending faults distribute in the Western Margin overthrust belt and the EW and NE-trending faults distribute in the Tianhuan Depression.\n\n\n4.2\nInversion of gravity datasets\n3-D gravity data inversion is an effective means to quantitatively interpret structures and faults and predict potential various deposits (Fregoso and Gallardo, 2009; Fan et al., 2014).\nIn order to reduce the multi-solution problem of gravity inversion, prior information is added to the inversion. The depth weighting technique used in this paper is a common constrained inversion method (Li and Oldenburg, 1998). However, the weight optimization of a large amount of constraint information has limitations in previous means. We applied the Bayesian theory to evaluate and reduce the uncertainty of observation data and prior constraints (Murata, 1993). Therefore, we applied inversion of residual gravity data constrained by seismic data to obtain the 3-D density anomaly structure with improved depth resolution of the study area. In order to test the reliability of the inversion result, the cross-section along the seismic line 4 was extracted from the inverted density anomaly model and compared with the seismic profile (Fig. 7\nb). The density section along Line 4 shows that the density anomalies are distributed by layers vertically and decrease with depth. There are high density anomalies with the lateral inhomogeneity in shallow part of the density section. The Luohe Formation is characterized by low density anomalies with lateral continuity and the uranium-bearing deposits are characterized by lower density anomalies. The structure configuration and formation characteristics identified by the density section are coincident with that reflected by the seismic profile. Fig. 7(a) shows the result of the 3-D inversion of seismic and gravity data with a depth of 2.4\u00a0km, including the NS-trending section and the EW-trending section. The inverted density model shows that the 3-D geological structure is characterized by the lateral variation and the vertical stratification. The density slice from the 3-D density anomaly model at 590\u00a0m depth, which is the average depth of the top of the Huanhe\u2013Huachi Formation (Fig. 8\na), is characterized by alternate high- and low-density bands. The low-density bands trending NW and N-S agree with the strikes of regional structure.\nIn general, the sliced density in the top of the Huanhe\u2013Huachi Formation trend to relatively complex and high. The density slice from the 3-D density anomaly model at 910\u00a0m depth, which is the average depth of the top of the Luohe Formation (Fig. 8b), is stable and uniform. The low-density zone trending NW and N-S is clamped between the high-density zones in the northeastern and southwestern parts of Fig. 8b. The area of wells drilling the uranium-bearing deposits is in the low-density zone. The density simple structure of the density anomaly indicates homogeneous lithology and sedimentary stability in the top of the Luohe Formation, as the stable roof with good sealing conditions for the formation and storage of uranium deposits. The density section from 3-D density anomaly model crossing well K01 along Section 1 is shown in Fig. 8c. The density structure in the south part of the Section 1 section can be composed of two layers. The density anomaly in the shallow layer is high and thinning from south to north, and the density anomaly in the lower layer is low and thickening near well K01 and Section 3. However, the density structure inverts in the north part of the Section 1 section. In general, the density anomaly dips toward the north and thickens from south to north. There is a gravity gradient zone near the intersection with Section 3, which can be interpreted as the fault. The density sections from 3-D density anomaly model crossing well K06 along Section 2 and crossing well SD01 along Section 3 are shown in Fig. 8d and e respectively. The density structure of the Section 2 section is similar to that of the Section 3 section. The western part of the density section is mainly characterized by the high-density anomaly dipping to the west, which reflects the west-dipping thrusting nappe structure in the Western Margin overthrust belt. The eastern part of the density section is mainly characterized by the low-density anomaly, which reflects the synclinal structure in the Tianhuan Depression. The density structure of the area near well K06 and well SD01 can be composed of two layers. High-density anomaly is in the upper layer and low-density anomaly is in the lower layer, where the uranium deposits are located.\n\n\n\n5\nResults and discussions\n\n5.1\nProvenance structure\nThe structures of provenance and deposits are one of the important factors controlling mineralization. A large number of granites and felsic volcanic rocks are exposed in orogenic and uplift belts in the southwest of the study area which are potential sources of uranium. As shown in Fig. 9\nc, the seismic amplitude is discontinuous and intersected with W-trend on the left of the Pengyang area, which reveals the overthrust structure. However, the seismic amplitude is continuous and parallel on the right of the Pengyang area, which represents the sedimentary strata. The fault near the Pengyang area can be interpreted as the boundary fault, namely the Qinglongshan-Pingliang fault (F2) combined with previous geological data. Therefore, the Western Margin overthrust belt is characterized by high density and disordered west-dipping reflections (Figs. 8d and 9c). It\u2019s comprised of a series of NS-trending thrust nappe, which is related to the extrusion in Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The Early Paleozoic and Proterozoic strata exposed in the Western Margin overthrust belt is the provenance area for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata. The weathering and denudation materials in the provenance area are transported to the deposition of Tianhuan depression through surface water system in Early Cretaceous sedimentary period. The Western Margin overthrust belt and the Tianhuan Depression formed the dustpan structure in basin-mountain transition belt, which is good for the migration and recharge of oxygen-enriched uranium-bearing ore-forming fluid.\n\n\n5.2\nOre-controlling of the fault structure\nSince fluid is the major carrier to transport ore-forming elements, fault structures interact closely with the ore-forming fluid flow in the hydrothermal system (Andersen et al., 2017). The NS-trending thrust faults with west dipping in the Western Margin overthrust belt control the migration and form of provenance. There are significantly anomalies in seismic response and gravity density on both sides of Mengyuan, which named as the Hui\u2018anpu-Shajingzi Fault(Figs. 9c and 6b). The Hui\u2018anpu-Shajingzi Fault is the basement fault cutting in the metamorphic basement through the sedimentary cover, interpreted as the boundary between the Western Margin overthrust belt and the Tianhuan Depression. The fault crossing Pengyang can be identified easily in the seismic profile and gravity anomalies, named as the Qinglongshan-Pingliang Fault, interpreted as the secondary fault parallel to the Hui\u2018anpu-Shajingzi Fault(Figs. 9c and 6b). The NS-trending thrust faults are controlled by the SW-trending compression of the Yanshan movement and Himalayan movement. In late Jurassic, the Tethys ocean began to open and the Kula plate subducted in the northwest, which led to the southwest part of Odors basin being in extrusion state, forming numerous NS-trending thrust faults. The Paleozoic, Triassic and Jurassic strata were exposed by thrust faults, and became erosion areas providing the uranium-bearing provenances. Since Late Miocene, Odors basin is uplifted and thrust faults were further reconstructed due to the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The gravity ridge coefficients map shows the EW and NW trending faults distribute in the Tianhuan Depression, in which the uranium deposits are mainly located(Fig. 6b).\nThe EW trending faults are multiple groups of conjugate high angle normal faults, which can be recognized in the seismic profile (Fig. 9b). The EW trending faults are normal faults formed by the NW-trending tension stress resulted from the SW-trending compressive stress and the nearly NS-trending rightward shear in the Himalayan tectonic deformation. The EW trending faults control the structural evolution and morphology the faulted sedimentation and is good for the enrichment of uranium-bearing fluids. The NW trending faults are thrust faults, which can be recognized in the seismic profile and gravity anomalies (Fig. 9a, b, d). The NW trending faults were caused by the SW-trending compression of the Yanshan movement and Himalayan movement. The uranium-bearing sedimentary area is dominated by NW trending thrust faults and the normal faults are derived faults. These faults cut through the roof or floor, or both of them as shown in Fig. 9. These faults can improve the physical property conditions of uranium deposits and become the channels for the migration of uranium-bearing and oxygen-bearing fluids. The hydrocarbons are buried in the underlying strata such as the Yanchang Formation of Late Triassic and Yan'an formation of Early Jurassic. Hydrocarbons flowed along the faults to the target layer and formed the restore environment are favorable for uranium ore-formation, or produced the secondary reduction and ore preservation after the formation of uranium deposits.\nThe structural styles of uranium-bearing sandstones in the study area include graben structure and normal flower structure. The graben structure crossing well K01 is controlled by normal faults on both sides as shown in the seismic profile (Fig. 9a). The faults on both sides often cut off the roof and floor\nto provide channels for the uranium-bearing fluids migrating and unloading. The normal flower structures can be identified on the 3-D density model (Fig. 9), reformed by the SW-trending compression of the Yanshan movement and Himalayan movement. In Early Cretaceous, the study area received rock fragments of Proterozoic and Paleozoic uranium rich strata in the southwest of the basin. In Late Cretaceous, the basin was uplifted by compression which promoted the escape of oil and gas in the source reservoir. It provided a favorable reducing medium for uranium mineralization. In Himalayan period, the structures in the study area were reversed by the severe extrusion, and formed the normal flower structures. Uranium-bearing deposits are mostly in traps formed by structural compression (inversion), and both sides are clamped by reverse faults. Faults often cut off the roof and floor of uranium-bearing sandstones, which is convenient for fluid migration and accumulation into traps.\n\n\n5.3\nRoof, floor and deposit\nThe aquiclude is related to the interlayer oxidation of mineralization. The structure of the roof and floor as the aquiclude can provide favorable structural conditions for the formation of interlayer oxidation zone. The bottom of the Huanhe\u2013Huachi Formation is characterized by strong continuous seismic amplitude and high-density anomaly (Fig. 5a and Fig. 7), which are related to Huanhe\u2013Huachi Formation sandstones with poor property. It\u2019s interpreted as the roof impermeable layer preventing the escape of uranium. The Luohe Formation sandstones and mudstones under uranium-bearing deposits are characterized by strong continuous seismic amplitude and medium and low density (Figs. 5a and 7), regarded as the floor. The good roof and floor impermeable layers formed a relatively independent metallogenic environment, which is conducive to the interlayer oxidation, as the main factor in causing uranium mineralization (Liu et al., 2018). We sliced the connecting-well gravity section to illustrate the spatial distribution of uranium-bearing strata, sandstones (Fig. 9.d). As the uranium-bearing strata, sandstones in the Luohe Formation are characterized by subparallel seismic facies, intermittent wave impedance and low-density anomaly. Subparallel seismic facies indicate that stratigraphic development of the Luohe Formation is in stable sedimentation conditions (Fig. 9a and Fig. 5c). The intermittent wave impedance is caused by aeolian cross-bedding of Luohe Formation sandstones. The low-density anomaly is due to the loosen structure of Luohe Formation sandstones. The differences between the uranium-bearing sandstones and their surrounding rocks in terms of their geophysical characteristics indicate the uranium-bearing sandstones can be identified by geophysical method in study area. In the instantaneous amplitude profile, the uranium-bearing sandstones are located in the low instantaneous amplitude zone(Fig. 5a). In the instantaneous frequency profile, the uranium-bearing sandstones are located in the low instantaneous frequency zone (Fig. 5b). In addition, the uranium-bearing sandstones are located in the low-density zone in 3-D density model. These geophysical characteristics are related to good porosity and developed features in the uranium-bearing sandstones. In Fig. 9.d, the depth of the uranium-bearing sandstones ranges 800\u20131250\u00a0m and the horizon of the uranium-bearing sandstones is traceable and stable. The uranium-bearing sandstones in the area near well K04-K06 is deeper than that in the area near well K01-K05, which indicates the south of the study area is closer to the center of the depression.\n\n\n5.4\nThickness of sandstones\nThe Luohe Formation is relatively stable with high maturity of components and structure and provides hydro-chemical conditions for the formation of uranium deposits. The Luohe formation has the stable roof and floor composed of the lacustrine mudstone and siltstone. It forms a huge mud-sand-mud structure, which is conducive to sandstone-type uranium mineralization. The structure of the Luohe Formation controls the structural style of the uranium-bearing sandstones. The distribution of the Luohe Formation determines the distribution of the uranium-bearing deposit. Therefore, we draw the top and bottom map of the Luohe Formation in a 3-D view (Fig. 10\n).\nThe Top structure of the Luohe Formation is the depression with local uplift from 600 to 1100\u00a0m depth (red to green) as shown in Fig. 10. The bottom structure depth ranges from 700 to 1510\u00a0m, which is similar to the top structure of the Luohe Formation. The top and bottom structure is obviously uplifted in the west and characterized by the local uplift of the depression in the east, which is related to the extrusion in Early Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The late tectonic inversion can form the structural tapping condition for uranium deposits or make faults activity, causing the escape of uranium. Well K07 is located at the gradient zone of the top and bottom structure, also the fracture zone, revealing the escape of uranium in the whole well. Well K04, SD01 and K06 are located at the deepest of the top and bottom of the Luohe Formation, which are in the sedimentary center, revealing the stable mineralized environment. The sandstone is a necessary precondition for mineralization and the uranium-bearing deposits are controlled by the thickness of sandstones. Therefore, it is of great significance to predict the thickness of sand body in the Luohe Formation. According to the top and bottom map of the Luohe Formation and the drilling data, we estimated the thickness of the Luohe Formation sandstones (Fig. 11\n). The thickest area of the Luohe Formation sandstones is the NEE trend, as the concentrated area of drilling the uranium-bearing deposits. The thickness of the Luohe Formation sandstones is gradually thinning to the north and south sides. The maximum thickness of the Luohe Formation sandstones is located in well K01, K02, K04, SD01, with a thickness of 400\u00a0m. According to drilling data, the thickest zone is also the deepest sedimentation and most favorable zone of uranium-bearing deposits.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nCombined with logging data, we calibrated and interpreted the Luohe Formation and uranium-bearing deposits. The distribution and properties of faults are identified by gravity scratch technology and seismic characteristics. 3-D inversion of residual gravity anomaly is carried out constrained by seismic data. Therefore, structural traps and faults of uranium-bearing sandstones are clearly delineated. The faults in the study area are mainly divided into two types: one is the NS-trending and west-dipping thrust faults, which are mostly parallel faults, controlling the contact relationship between the overthrust belt and sedimentary depression. The other is the NW-trending thrust faults, which are located in the sedimentary depression. The identified faults with high permeability in the 3D density model are the important ore-controlling structures, acting as channels for ore-forming fluids flow. Due to the late structural inversion, normal flower structural traps were formed and controlling the mineralization. The development and reactivation of the ore-controlling structures are influenced by the regional fault under the compression and extension environment in different periods. We applied seismic attributes and seismic impedance inversion to identify the seismic response characteristics of the Luohe Formation sandstones and the roof and floor strata. The roof and floor as the impermeable layers formed a closed metallogenic space, which is good for the interlayer oxidation of the uranium-bearing sandstones. The uranium-bearing sandstones are characterized by weak reflection and relative continuity in seismic reflection, low amplitude with poor continuity, medium and low frequency with poor continuity, and low gravity anomaly. These may be related to the loose structure and good property of uranium-bearing sandstones. According to the results of seismic and gravity inversion, we drew the map of the thickness of Luohe Formation sandstones. It shows that the uranium-bearing deposits are mostly in the thickest area of sandstones, which provides the geophysical basis for uranium prospecting in the future. Therefore, geophysical exploration is of great significance for identifying ore-controlling structures and faults. It can provide ideas and guidance for uranium prospecting in potential favorable areas.\n\n","61":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nOrogenic-type gold deposits account for the majority (75%) of global gold production (Jenkin et al., 2014; Phillips, 2013), and have a number of common features: 1) deformed and variably-metamorphosed (commonly greenschist-facies) host rocks, with sulfide\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sericite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0carbonate alteration assemblages (Groves, 2003; Groves et al., 2016); 2) close space\u2013time association with compression-to-extension transition in accretionary orogens, e.g., the Kalgoorlie goldfield (Western Australia) and the Ashanti deposit (Ghana) (Phillips et al., 1996; Schmidt Mumm et al., 1997; Wilkinson and Kesler, 2007); 3) ore precipitation in quartz veins controlled by secondary brittle-ductile shear zones of crustal-scale structures (Bierlein et al., 2009; Bierlein et al., 2006; Groves et al., 1998); 4) low sulfide (3\u20135\u00a0vol%) and moderate carbonate (5\u201315\u00a0vol%) contents (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 1998); (5) ore-forming fluids belong to the H2O-CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4 system (CO2\u00a0+\u00a0CH4\u00a0=\u00a05\u201330\u00a0vol%), with 200\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C and salinity of 3\u201310\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. (Roedder, 1984; Wilkinson, 2001).\nGold mineralization along the Zagros Orogen (SW Iran) is well-documented by many studies, but its genetic type was variably suggested to be orogenic (Aliyari et al., 2009; Aliyari et al., 2007; Asadi et al., 2018; Kouhestani et al., 2014; Niroomand et al., 2011), intrusion-related (Moritz et al., 2006), epithermal (Ashrafpour et al., 2012; Daliran, 2008; Kouhestani et al., 2020; Kouhestani et al., 2019; Kouhestani et al., 2015a; Kouhestani et al., 2015b; Kouhestani et al., 2012; Richards et al., 2006), Carlin-like (Asadi et al., 2000), or sediment-hosted (Mehrabi et al., 1999).\nThe NW-trending Zagros orogen extends from the northwestern border of Iran to the Strait of Hormuz, and comprises three parallel tectonic belts, i.e., (from NE to SW) the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc, the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone (SSZ), and the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 1\nB) (Alavi, 1994). The orogen was formed by the Cretaceous-Tertiary convergence of the Eurasian and Afro-Arabian plates (Golonka, 2004; Hou and Zhang, 2015; Moritz et al., 2006).\nThe SSZ extends from Sanandaj (northwest to Sirjan) in the southeast for over 1500\u00a0km. Many (super-)large metamorphic rock-hosted gold deposits were discovered along the zone, especially in the northern SSZ (Aliyari et al., 2012; Richards and Sholeh, 2016), including the Kharapeh, Qolqoleh, and Muteh (Abdollahi et al., 2009; Aliyari et al., 2007; Kouhestani et al., 2018; Kouhestani et al., 2015a; Kouhestani et al., 2014; Morishita and Takeno, 2010; Moritz et al., 2006; Niroomand et al., 2011). In the southern SSZ, however, only one gold deposit (Zartorosht) was discovered (Fig. 1B) (Aliyari et al., 2012; Aliyari and Rastad, 2014). All these gold deposits in the northern and southern SSZ are spatially and temporally related to the Late Cretaceous-Tertiary collision of the Iranian microcontinent with the Afro-Arabian plate (Aliyari et al., 2012; Almasi et al., 2017).\nDespite its immense economic significance, many metallogenic questions of the SSZ remain unanswered, including the geodynamic background, mineralization styles and mechanism, and potential metallogenic link among gold deposits in the SSZ (Aliyari et al., 2012; Heidari et al., 2006; Mohajjel and Fergusson, 2000; Richards and Sholeh, 2016). Resolving these problems is important but complex due to the multiphase metamorphic and tectonic overprinting from the Triassic to Tertiary, as demonstrated by the widespread metamorphic complexes and structures (Mohajjel et al., 2003; Omrani et al., 2008; Sarkarinejad et al., 2008).\nThe Zartorosht deposit is one of the few gold deposits related to the Tertiary Zagros orogeny in southern Iran, and was generally regarded as orogenic-type (Aliyari and Rastad, 2014). However, little is known about its ore-forming fluids and metallogenesis due to the lack of comprehensive studies (Heydari et al., 2006; Richards and Sholeh, 2016). Study of Au ore-related fluid inclusions (FIs) can reveal the ore-fluid nature and evolution (Goldstein, 2003). At Zartorosht, numerous FIs are present in auriferous quartz from both the ores and metamorphic wallrocks, and detailed FI study could reveal the ore-fluid evolution and establish potential genetic link between the gold mineralization and orogenic events.\nIn this paper, we report new data of microthermometry and multi-isotope (C-H-O-He-Ar) geochemistry of FIs from gold-bearing quartz veins at Zartorosht. These data suggest that Zartorosht is an orogenic-type deposit formed during continent\u2013continent collision. Integrated with geochemical data from the ores and ore hosts, we clarified the ore-fluid nature and revealed the key controls of ore transport and deposition. Finally, we discussed the metallogenic mechanism of the Zartorosht gold deposit. Our findings provide new insights into the orogenic-type mineral systems, and will help to understand the regional metallogeny and aid future exploration in the Zagros orogen.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\n\n2.1\nGeological setting\nThe Zagros orogen was formed by the late Mesozoic\u2013Cenozoic Neo-Tethys subduction and eventual closure. Prolonged convergence along the Zagros orogen during this period formed a series of orogenic-type gold and base-metal (Fe, Cu, Zn) deposits (Fig. 1A) (Agard et al., 2011; McQuarrie and Van Hinsbergen, 2013; Richards and Sholeh, 2016). The SSZ in the NE Zagros orogen was in an Andean-type continental arc setting with calc-alkaline magmatism (e.g., diorite and gabbro) in the Middle Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous (Agard et al., 2005; Mouthereau et al., 2012), and the region was uplifted in the Late Cretaceous due to the Iranian\u2013Afro-Arabian collision (Alavi, 1994; Mohajjel et al., 2003), resulting in extensive greenschist-facies metamorphism accompanied by felsic granitoid emplacement along the northern SSZ (Berberian and Berberian, 2011; Ghasemi and Talbot, 2006).\nSeparated along the Golpaygan township (Fig. 1B), the southern SSZ comprises rocks that were deformed in the Middle to Late Triassic, whereas the northern SSZ includes felsic intrusions deformed in the Late Cretaceous (Eftekharnejad, 1981; Ghasemi and Talbot, 2006; Mohajjel and Fergusson, 2000). Lithostratigraphy of the SSZ consists of Paleozoic-Mesozoic magmatic and metamorphic rocks, which are the most deformed along the Zagros orogen (Ghasemi and Talbot, 2006). Ophiolite fragments scattered in the SSZ were interpreted as Neo-Tethyan remnants (Richards, 2003).\nRegional structures in the SSZ are related to Late Jurassic\u2013Tertiary Alpine compression, which formed a series of NW-trending sedimentary and metamorphic belts, NW-trending folds, and SW-dipping thrust faults (Agard et al., 2005; Berberian and King, 1981; Mohajjel et al., 2003; Mohajjel and Fergusson, 2000; Stocklin, 1968). Two tectonic accretional styles were recognized in the SSZ: a low-pressure Late Cimmerian (Jurassic\u2013Cretaceous) style, and the compressive subduction during the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene (Agard et al., 2005; Alavi, 2004; Alavi, 1994).\nJurassic-Tertiary calc-alkaline magmatic rocks emplaced along the SSZ and Urumieh-Dokhtar arc can be divided into two types (Mazhari et al., 2009; Omrani et al., 2008): 1) Jurassic plutonic rocks intruding the Precambrian sequence, and 2) Late Cretaceous calc-alkaline volcanic rocks. After the Jurassic magmatic peak of granites associated with subduction in the SSZ, calc-alkaline magmatism migrated southeast and northeast to form the Tertiary Urumieh-Dokhtar arc (Agard et al., 2005; Berberian and Berberian, 2011; Chiu et al., 2013; Shahabpour, 2007).\n\n\n2.2\nOre deposit geology\nThe Zartorosht gold deposit comprises three ore segments, among these the S3 is the biggest one that contains over 80% of the gold (Fig. 2\n). Most of the ore-hosting strata belong to the Paleozoic Sargaz greenschist-facies metamorphic complex (Sabzehei, 1974), and consist of: 1) interbedded marble and calcic schists, 2) metamorphosed diorite and monzodiorite, and 3) muscovite schists. This sequence is unconformably overlain by Lower\u2013Middle Jurassic conglomerates and sandstones (Shafiei et al., 2011). Minor magmatic rocks are exposed in the mining area, including mainly the Early Jurassic granodiorite in western Zartorosht. In addition, some small intermediate-felsic dikes had intruded the metamorphosed plutonic rocks.\nThe Sargaz complex has undergone various deformation and metamorphism events, showing brittle to brittle-ductile (shear) deformation features. These include two sets of nearly vertical faults, i.e., EW-trending thrust faults and NS-trending normal faults. The former is ore-related and cut by the latter. Regional NW- to EW-trending thrust faults control the overall ore deposit distribution, but the orebodies were mainly developed in parallel with the sub-level E-W-trending normal faults. In addition, some lensoidal orebodies were developed parallel to the metamorphic host rock foliation. These orebodies commonly have higher gold grades and mylonitic fabrics.\nHigh-grade gold ores occur solely in auriferous quartz veins (<1\u00a0m thick), and the gold mineralization extends well into the alteration halos (up to 15\u00a0m thick). Mineralized zones in brittle structures are up to 50\u00a0m-long and 20\u00a0m-wide, with gold grades of 1.5\u20133.5\u00a0g\/t (avg. 2.6\u00a0g\/t) (Aliyari et al., 2012; Rastgoo Moghadam, 2005).\nGold exists as both native gold and invisible gold in auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite (Rastgoo Moghadam, 2005). Based on mineral assemblages and vein crosscutting relations, three alteration\/mineralization stages can be identified (Zheng et al., 2021; Fig. 3\n): (1): pre-ore stage quartz and pyrite alteration (Fig. 4\nA, 4D and 5A); (2): main ore stage quartz and native gold-sulfide (Fig. 4B), including three substages of quartz (Fig. 4B and C), pyrite-gold (Fig. 5\nB\u2013C) and native gold (Fig. 4H and 5G\u2013I) mineralization and marcasite-limonite-hematite-apatite-rutile alteration (Fig. 4E\u2013G; Fig. 4I and 5D\u2013F); (3) post-ore carbonate-sericite alteration (Fig. 4J and K).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\n\n3.1\nOre mineralogy\nPetrographic observation and mineral assemblage identification were performed with a ZEISS AXIO microscope under reflected and transmitted light and a TESCAN MIRA Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) at the School of Marine Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). The polished sections (\u223c300\u00a0\u03bcm thick) were coated with carbon, with 20\u00a0s EDS measuring time for each analysis. The back-scattered electron (BSE) detector was used to obtain BSE images. The analysis beam voltage and current were set at 15\u00a0kV and 1nA, respectively. Images were collected from one scan of 95\u00a0s photo speed with a processing resolution of 1024\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0768 pixels and 256\u00a0Gy levels.\n\n\n3.2\nFluid inclusion laser Raman spectroscopy and microthermometry\nFluid inclusions were first observed under the optical microscope to identify their texture, paragenesis, and phase proportions at ambient temperature. Secondary inclusions distributed along fractures or in trails across grain boundaries were avoided, whilst primary and pseudosecondary fluid inclusions were selected (Roedder, 1984). Laser Raman spectroscopic analysis of FI components was carried out with a Renishaw inVia micro-confocal Raman spectrometer equipped with an Ar ion laser (514.5\u00a0nm) at the Instrumental Analysis & Research Center of SYSU. The measurement temperature is around 25\u00a0\u00b0C, the power is 10\u201320 mW, and the scan range is 50\u20134000\u00a0cm\u22121.\nFluid inclusion microthermometric analysis was undertaken at the Key Laboratory of Marine Resources and Coastal Engineering, SYSU, using a Linkam THMSG600 freezing and heating system equipped with an Olympus microscope (BX51P). The US Fluid INC standard was used to calibrate the temperatures at \u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C, and 374.1\u00a0\u00b0C. FIs were initially cooled to \u2212190\u00a0\u00b0C at a rate of \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C\/min (and then held for 5\u00a0min) to keep all the inclusion components frozen. The inclusions were then heated at 5\u00a0\u00b0C\/min and decreased to 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C\/min from \u2212190.0 to \u2212182.5\u00a0\u00b0C and \u221260.0 to \u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C around the triple point of CH4 and CO2, respectively, and held for one minute in each range. The heating rate was 1\u00a0\u00b0C\/min from \u221240 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C to measure the final melting temperature of CO2-H2O clathrate, the partial homogenization temperature of CO2, and the final melting temperature of ice. Finally, the system was heated at 3\u00a0\u00b0C\/min until near the homogeneous phase transition point, when a slower heating rate (0.5\u20131\u00a0\u00b0C\/min) was used (Liu et al., 2019).\nCalculations of salinity and density were done with FLINCOR (Brown, 1989). The CO2 molar fractions (XCO2) for individual inclusions were calculated using the program FLINCOR and equations of Brown (1989) and Brown and Lamb (1989), respectively. According to homogenization temperatures and behaviors, and the proportion of CO2 phase in C-type FIs, we estimate the FI trapping pressure using the FLINCOR program (Brown, 1989) and the formula of Bowers and Helgeson (1983) for the H2O\u2013CO2\u2013NaCl system.\n\n\n3.3\nC-H-O-He-Ar isotopes\nThe analyses were performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory of the Beijing Geological Research Institute of Nuclear Industry. Mineralized quartz samples from the main-ore stage were crushed to 40\u201360 mesh and hand-picked under a binocular microscope to ensure purity. After that, 10\u00a0g of quartz sample was weighed and packed into aluminum foil, and then transferred to a crucible for gas extraction under high-vacuum conditions. The samples were then fused at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C to separate He from Ar, by driving the released gases purified through the activated charcoal traps at the liquid nitrogen temperature. The minimum heat blanks for the MM5400 mass spectrum are: 4He\u00a0=\u00a05.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212\u00a0cm3\u00a0STP\/g; 40Ar\u00a0=\u00a09.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210\u00a0cm3\u00a0STP\/g. The Lanzhou standard gas (AIRLZ2003) was used to normalize the analytical results, and the precision for the noble gas isotope measurements is better than 10% (Stuart et al., 1995). The \u03b4D and \u03b413C values of FIs in quartz were determined by thermal decrepitation to extract the fluid and carbonaceous material from 5\u00a0g of sample (mineral fragments of 0.5\u20131.0\u00a0mm diameter). The extracted water was reduced with carbon to generate H2, while the carbonaceous material was oxidized to vapor CO2 with Cu2O at 650\u00a0\u00b0C. Since there is no hydrogen or carbon in quartz (SiO2), the \u03b4DV-SMOW and \u03b413CV-PDB values of quartz can approximate the \u03b4DH2O and \u03b413CCO2 values of FI in quartz. For the quartz O-isotope analysis, the samples were prepared by BrF5 digestion (Clayton and Mayeda, 1963). The H-O-C isotope compositions were determined with a MAT 251EM mass spectrometer. The standards used are Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) for H and O, and Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) for C. The analytical precision is 2\u2030 for \u03b4D and \u03b418O, and 0.2\u2030 for \u03b413C. Detailed analytical method descriptions are given in Coplen et al. (1983). Hydrothermal fluid \u03b418O values were calculated from the FIs homogenization temperatures and the quartz-water oxygen isotope fractionation of Clayton et al. (1972) and M\u00e9heut et al. (2007).\nThe parameters of R and Ra represent the 3He\/4He values of the sample and the atmosphere (1.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126), respectively, whilst 40Ar* represents the radiogenic 40Ar in the inclusions (40Ar*\u00a0=\u00a040Ar\u00a0\u2212\u00a0295.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036Ar). F4He represents the 4He\/40Ar* ratio of the sample and atmosphere, i.e., F4He\u00a0=\u00a0 4He\/40Ar*) sample\/(4He\/40Ar*) atmosphere. There are three major reservoirs of noble gases in hydrothermal fluids, each with distinct He and Ar contents and ratios: (1) atmospheric saturated water (include atmospheric precipitation and seawater) has typically R\/Ra\u00a0=\u00a01 and 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0=\u00a0295.5; (2) mantle fluid has characteristic high 3He content and 40Ar\/36Ar values (>40,000), and R\/Ra\u00a0=\u00a06\u20139; (3) crustal fluid features high radiogenic He and Ar, and has R\/Ra\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u20130.05 and 40Ar\/36Ar\u00a0>\u00a0295.5 (Simmons et al., 1987; Stuart et al., 1995). The ratio of mantle-derived He addition can be calculated with the following equation (the values of the two end-members are (3He\/4He) crust\u00a0=\u00a00.01 Ra and (3He\/4He) mantle\u00a0=\u00a06 Ra):\n\n\n\nMantle\n-\nd\ne\nr\ni\nv\ne\nd\n-\nH\ne\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\nsample\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\ncrust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\nmantle\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nH\ne\n\n\n\n\n\ncrust\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nFluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry\nTwo types of quartz in the main-ore stage appear as vuggy, coarse-grained (0.1\u20132\u00a0mm) euhedral-subhedral crystals (Fig. 4A). Qtz I was formed before Qtz II as Qtz I veins are cut by Qtz II (Fig. 4B). The subhedral grains show healing microfractures cutting through distinct growth zones (Fig. 6\nA), where the studied FIs are present. These two types of quartz represent two consecutive metallogenic events of the main-ore stage. Five different types of primary and pseudosecondary FIs are identified in Qtz I and Qtz II (Fig. 6A) based on their differences of phase (L-V) ratio and chemical composition revealed by laser Raman analyses (Zheng et al., 2016). This study use the fluid inclusion assemblages (FIA) approach, which is the most finely discriminated, petrographically associated group of inclusions (Goldstein, 2001). Here, we selected inclusions in closely associated groups with petrographic and microthermometric evidence, indicating that they were trapped simultaneously (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). We used the consistency of the phase ratio (and temperature measurement data) to assess whether the different FIs in individual FIAs captured the same single phase (Chi et al., 2021).\n\n4.1\nFluid inclusion types\n\n4.1.1\nPC-type (pure CO2 inclusion)\nThese inclusions are characterized by its dark and monophase at ambient temperature (Fig. 6C). PC-type inclusions are tetragonal, ellipsoidal or irregularly-shaped and 5\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm in size. They are composed dominantly of CO2 with minor hydrocarbons (e.g., CH4), as indicated by laser Raman analysis (Fig. 6F). They formed a CO2 vapor phase during cooling (accounting for 20\u201370\u00a0vol% of the FIs), and then homogenized into liquid phase during heating. PC-type FIs are typically isolated as clustered assemblages or associated with C1- and C2-type inclusions (Fig. 6E).\n\n\n4.1.2\nC-type (CO2-H2O inclusion)\nThere are two subtypes based on their phase numbers, i.e., three-phase C1-type and two-phase C2-type.\nC1-type inclusions are the most abundant in the auriferous quartz, and are composed of vapor CO2, liquid CO2, and liquid H2O at ambient temperature. They are of oval- or fusiform-shape and 6\u201326\u00a0\u03bcm (mostly 12\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm) in size. These FIs occur in isolation or small clusters, and typically associated with C2- and PC-type inclusions (Fig. 6E). Carbonic phase of C1-type inclusions occupies ca. 50\u201380\u00a0vol%, and some hydrocarbons (e.g., CH4) were detected by laser Raman analysis in the vapor phase (Fig. 6F). Molar volumes of the CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4 inclusions were estimated at 25\u00a0\u00b0C by FLINCOR (55\u201370\u00a0cm3\/mol), and melting of clathrate was observed after that of ice. C1-type inclusions homogenized partially into carbonic phase (vapor CO2), and then totally into CO2 phase.\nC2-type inclusions (mostly ore-related) are composed of vapor CO2 and liquid H2O. The vapor phase typically occupies ca. 20\u201350\u00a0vol% of the inclusions. These inclusions (size: 5\u201322\u00a0\u03bcm) are subrounded to rectangular, and are smaller than C1-type FIs. They homogenized partially into liquid CO2 phase and totally into aqueous phase. In some cases, C1- and C2-type inclusions coexist intimately (Fig. 6D), although they are different in the number of phases. We propose that they were formed simultaneously, and that C1- and C2-type FIs occur within a microdomain of a crystal and belong to a FIA.\n\n\n4.1.3\nW-type (aqueous inclusion)\nThere are two subtypes based on their phase volume, i.e., liquid-rich W1-type and vapor-rich W2-type.\nW1-type inclusions consist of a liquid H2O phase and a smaller vapor H2O phase (20\u201340\u00a0vol%) at ambient temperature and homogenized into liquid. These FIs are elongated and commonly small (<10\u00a0\u00b5m). They occur in trails cutting quartz grain boundaries and are rectangular or subrounded.\nW2-type inclusions are relatively scarce and composed of a liquid H2O phase and a vapor H2O phase, characterized by their larger and darker gas bubble (70\u201390\u00a0vol%) (Fig. 6B). These FIs commonly homogenized into vapor. They are elliptical, with sizes of 6\u201314\u00a0\u00b5m. The trails with W1- and W2-type inclusions are generally combined. No phase transition was observed in the freezing runs.\n\n\n\n4.2\nOccurrence and temporal relationship of fluid inclusions\nThe time sequence of fluid entrapment can be inferred from the FIA distribution in veins of different ore stages and the crosscutting relationship of independent inclusion trials (Ulrich and Heinrich, 2002). In this study, fluid inclusions distributed in different stages of veins were analyzed to describe the relationship between fluid, vein formation, and ore precipitation. Relative abundance of different FI types was determined by visual estimation.\nC1- and C2-type FIs constitute the majority of fluid inclusions in quartz in ore veins, whereas W1- and W2-type FIs were mainly observed as individual groups in quartz grains from barren veins. Primary FIs occur as randomly scattered groups of both C1- and C2-type (Fig. 6E and Fig. 7\nD), and PC-type FIs also occur near with C1- and C2-type FIs (Fig. 6E).\nIn early barren veins, the PC- and C-type FIs are often randomly distributed or occur as clusters, and are thus regarded as primary. PC-type inclusions occur predominantly in early barren veins, and constitute over 90% of the total primary FI population. Rare W-type (3\u20136%) and C-type (4\u20137%) inclusions constitute the remaining 10%. Well-defined secondary trails with C- and W-type FIs were observed to cut the quartz crystals, which is indicative of a later-stage entrapment.\nIn early-ore Qtz I veins, PC-type inclusions are less common, whereas C-type inclusions predominate (10\u201390%). W-type inclusions can be observed but are relatively rare (<5%). Quartz veins are dominated by C1-type inclusions with high CO2 content (>50%), followed by C2\u2013 and W-type inclusions.\nIn late-ore Qtz II veins, C2-type inclusions are prevalent and the number of all the other fluid inclusion types decrease. At this stage, C2-type inclusions commonly have CO2 contents around 30%, and minor C1-type inclusions with high CO2 content still exist (<10%). The late barren veins contain only W-type inclusions.\n\n\n4.3\nMicrothermometric results\nThe results are reported in Table 1\n and plotted in Fig. 8\n. Data of two substages (i.e., early and late ore stages) of main-ore stage is represented by the FIs in Qtz I and Qtz II, respectively. Any FIs with obviously post-entrapment modifications, e.g., necking down through a phase boundary, stretching, deformation of the host crystal (Chi et al., 2021), are discarded from the microthermometric measurement.\nThe early-ore stage inclusions are dominated by C1-type, with minor C2- and PC-type. For C1-type inclusions, the melting temperature of CO2 solid phase is \u221258.9 to \u221256.7\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating small amount of CH4 and N2 gases, consistent with the laser Raman analysis results (Fig. 6F). The clathrate melting temperature (7.9\u20139.3\u00a0\u00b0C) corresponds to a salinity of 0.43\u20136.81\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. The CO2 molar volume accounts for 20.4\u201323.8\u00a0mol%. The total homogenization (to liquid CO2 phase) temperatures range from 241 to 309\u00a0\u00b0C (peak at 270\u2013290\u00a0\u00b0C), and some C1-type inclusions burst at around 320\u00a0\u00b0C before homogenization. The CO2 density ranges from 0.61 to 0.98\u00a0g\/cm3, and the bulk density varies from 0.70 to 0.98\u00a0g\/cm3. For C2-type inclusions, liquid CO2 and vapor CO2 coexist during cooling and the melting temperatures of CO2 solid phase range from \u221258.9 to \u221257.4\u00a0\u00b0C. The clathrate melting temperatures range from 8.8 to 9.9\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to salinity of 2.71\u20136.08\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. The homogenization temperatures of CO2 (22\u201325\u00a0mol% CO2, homogenize to liquid) range from 17.3 to 28.1\u00a0\u00b0C, and the total homogenization temperatures range from 250 to 290\u00a0\u00b0C (peak at 260\u2013280\u00a0\u00b0C, homogenized to liquid). The average total homogenization temperature of C2-type FIs is slightly lower than C1-type FIs. All the PC-type inclusions homogenized into liquid at 259\u2013288\u00a0\u00b0C, and have fluid salinity of 0.7\u20132.2\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. and density of 0.81\u20130.98\u00a0g\/cm3.\nThe late-ore stage FIs in Qtz II are almost all CO2-bearing C1 and C2 types. During the heating runs, the initial melting temperatures of C1-type FIs (n\u00a0=\u00a044) are concentrated around \u221260.7 to \u221257.3\u00a0\u00b0C, which are slightly lower than the triple point of pure CO2 (\u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C). This indicates that small amount of other volatile components (such as N2 and H2) in the vapor phase. The CO2 clathrate melting temperatures range from 6.1 to 7.8\u00a0\u00b0C, and the corresponding salinity is 4.5\u20136.9\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. The CO2 homogenization temperatures range from 18.2 to 27.9\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u201326\u00a0mol% CO2, homogenized to liquid), and the total homogenization temperatures range from 198 to 261\u00a0\u00b0C (peak at 230\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C, homogenized to carbonic phase). C2-type FIs (n\u00a0=\u00a048) yielded clathrate melting temperatures of 10.1\u201310.5\u00a0\u00b0C, corresponding to salinities of 2.9\u20136.2\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. The homogenization (to liquid) temperatures range from 198 to 248\u00a0\u00b0C, and the bulk density ranges from 0.66 to 0.88\u00a0g\/cm3.\n\n\n\n5\nCarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen isotopes\nThe C-H-O isotope analysis results of the CO2-bearing FIs are presented in Table 2\n. Our analyzed samples yielded \u03b413CCO2\u00a0=\u00a0\u221221.1 to \u22126.2 \u2030, \u03b4DH2O\u00a0=\u00a0\u221269.8 to \u221245.1 \u2030, and \u03b418OH2O\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u20135.8 \u2030.\n\n\n6\nHelium and argon isotopes\nThe He-Ar isotope analysis results of the CO2-bearing FIs are shown in Table 3\n. The FIs trapped in quartz yielded 4He\u00a0=\u00a00.280\u20130.997\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0cm3\u00a0STP\u00a0g\u22121, 3He\u00a0=\u00a00.215\u20130.546\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221213\u00a0cm3\u00a0STP\u00a0g\u22121, 40Ar\u00a0=\u00a012.36\u2013194.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0cm3\u00a0STP\u00a0g\u22121, 36Ar\u00a0=\u00a00.03\u20130.63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0cm3\u00a0STP g\u22121, and R\/Ra\u00a0=\u00a00.251\u20130.8.\nThe calculated R\/Ra values of our samples (0.251\u20130.8) are between typical crustal and mantle fluid (6\u20139), and the calculated mantle-derived He contents in the FIs samples are 4.17\u201313.26% (avg. 8.34%).\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nNature of ore-forming fluid\nMicrothermometry data show that the CO2-bearing FIs have homogenization temperatures (Th)\u00a0=\u00a0230\u2013290\u00a0\u00b0C and salinities\u00a0=\u00a03\u20137\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv. The ore-forming fluid is of low-moderate temperature and low salinity, which mimics those of typical orogenic gold deposits (Thtot\u00a0=\u00a0200\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C; salinity\u00a0=\u00a03\u201310\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv.; Groves et al., 1998). Laser Raman analyses show that fluids of the CO2-type FIs belong to the H2O-NaCl-CO2 system (Fig. 7E). The coexistence of multiple FI types with varying liquid\/vapor ratios in single FIA (Fig. 6E) supports that CO2\u2013H2O immiscibility occurred during the gold mineralization, in which C1- and C2-type FIs represent the vapor and liquid phases of an immiscible fluid system (entrapped coevally), whereas PC-type FIs represent a different fluid entrapped before or after the other FI types (Chi et al., 2021).\nHydrogen, oxygen, and carbon form various volatile phases in the lithosphere, and their large isotope behavioral difference generates significant fractionation in various physical and chemical processes in nature (e.g., evaporation, diffusion, permeation, adsorption, crystallization, metasomatism, and biological effects; Hoefs, 2009). Therefore, isotope data and ratios (e.g., \u03b418O, \u03b4D, and \u03b413C) can be useful to trace the source of lode gold ore-fluid and metals (e.g., Beaudoin and Pitre, 2005; Lawrence et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016), although the data interpretation may be equivocal (e.g., Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Kerr et al., 2018). The \u03b4DH2O (\u221269.8 to \u221245.1\u2030) and \u03b418OH2O (2.3\u20136.0\u2030) values of our samples fall into the overlapping magmatic and metamorphic fluid field (Fig. 9\n), and slightly deviated from the orogenic-type gold deposit field but close to other orogenic gold deposits in the SSZ (Abdollahi et al., 2009; Aliyari et al., 2009). A general problem for fluid inclusion isotope analysis is the separation of primary from secondary fluid inclusions (Yang et al., 1995). In this study, we try to minimize the impact of secondary FI inclusions by selecting suitable quartz grains for isotopic analyses. The FI hosting-quartz grains were first crushed into particles with a diameter around 2\u00a0mm and then observed under the microscope, we select quartz crystal that has the most abundant primary fluid inclusions which would provide meaningful isotopic data, while crystals have a large number of secondary inclusions were avoided.\nPrevious studies show that the \u03b413C values of mantle-derived CO2 fluids are about \u22127 to \u22125\u2030 (Hoefs, 2009), and those for the continental crust carbon and sedimentary organic matter are around \u22127\u2030 and between \u221230 to \u221210\u2030, respectively (Faure, 1987). Our samples have \u03b413C values (\u22126.2 to \u221221.1\u2030, avg. \u221212.8\u2030) (Table 2) resembling an organic matter-related source, and the carbon was probably derived from the Paleozoic volcanic-sedimentary ore host (Sargaz-Abshour complex) at Zartorosht during the Middle-Late Triassic orogenic event.\nThe high R values (0.35\u20131.12, avg. 0.70) of our samples suggest that mantle-derived gases were trapped inside the FIs (Zheng et al., 2012). Calculation on the mantle-derived He input yielded an average of 8.34%, which also indicates that the ore fluids contain certain amount of mantle materials. Meanwhile, the He and Ar isotope data of our samples plot inside the overlapping mantle- and crustal source fields (Fig. 10\n), indicating an initial deep mantle-derived fluid source, although fluids sourced from subducting-slab dehydration\/devolatilization cannot be ruled out (Bierlein et al., 2006).\n\n\n7.2\nGold metallogeny at Zartorosht and in the southern SSZ\nAt Zartorosht, compositions of metallic minerals from the quartz-sulfides-gold veins resemble typical orogenic gold mineral assemblage. Three-dimensional pressure\u2013temperature-salinity evolution diagram of the ore-forming fluids favor a progressive temperature drop from the early- to late-ore stages (Hu et al., 2021) (Fig. 11\n). This temperature drop may have caused the gold to precipitate (e.g., Pokrovski et al., 2014). Thermodynamic calculations by Helgeson and Garrels (1968) proposed that the cooling of an acidic fluid can effectively co-precipitate gold, quartz, and pyrite in veins. The Zartorosht ore fluid is CO2-rich, and CO2 can buffer the fluid acidity and increase the gold concentration by buffering the fluid in a pH range where elevated gold concentration can be maintained by complexation with reduced sulphur (Phillips and Evans, 2004; Zheng et al., 2014). However, the gold precipitation effect by fluid cooling may not be as strong as other factors such as pressure drop (Hemley et al., 1992; Hemley and Hunt, 1992; Kouzmanov et al., 2012). Based on structural observations, Boyle (1969) argued that the pressure change caused by rock fracturing have far greater effect on gold-quartz precipitation than temperature. Through thermodynamic simulation of the auriferous quartz vein formation by earthquakes, Weatherley and Henley (2013) proposed that the opening of the seismic event interruption layer would cause a major pressure drop due to void formation, and the flash vaporization would cause quartz, gold and other metals to precipitate effectively. At Zartorosht, micro fracturing of the auriferous quartz (Fig. 4J and K) and the native gold grains in pyrite microfractures (Fig. 5H) indicate pressure fluctuation during the gold deposition. Pressure drop could thus be the major ore precipitation mechanism at Zartorosht.\nIn this study, we concluded that the Zartorosht gold ores are most similar to orogenic gold deposits, with the key reasons being (1) no clear evidence of ore-causative magmatism; (2) the lode Au orebodies are hosted in greenschist-facies metamorphic rocks and controlled by EW-trending thrust faults; (3) the marcasite-pyrite-limonite assemblage coexists with native gold, and the alteration styles are dominated by quartz, calcite, sericite and sulfides; (4) the ore-forming fluids are of low to moderate temperature, low-salinity, and belong to the CO2-bearing H2O-NaCl-CO2 system. The high fluid 3He\/4He value is consistent with a mixed crustal and mantle (3He-\/CO2-rich) origin (Simmons et al., 1987). This lode-gold mineralization was then driven through secondary regional ductile\u2013brittle shearing of different scales, and these structures likely provided the conduits for the fluid migration and ore deposition (de Ronde et al., 2011; de Ronde et al., 2003; Groves and Foster, 1993) (Fig. 12\n).\nUnderstanding of gold metallogeny in the southern SSZ is still insufficient due to many factors, including the lack of outcrops and low level of exploration. Meanwhile, systematic geochemical and structural studies have been conducted on the major gold deposits in the northern SSZ, such as the Muteh (Kouhestani et al., 2014; Moritz et al., 2006), Kharapeh (Niroomand et al., 2011) and the Qolqoleh (Aliyari et al., 2009) deposits. Gold ores in these deposits are commonly associated with NE- to EW- directed extension, indicating transpressional stress regime associated with the Zagros orogenic process (Azeuda Ndonfack et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1).\nThree major alteration\/mineralization stages are identified at Zartorosht, namely the (I) pre-ore quartz-pyrite alteration, (II) main-ore quartz-native gold-sulfide mineralization, and (III) post-ore carbonate-sericite alteration.\n\n\n(2).\nThe ore-fluid compositions vary but are featured mainly by low-salinity and CO2-bearing. Fluid inclusion and H\u2013O\u2013C\u2013He\u2013Ar isotopic data reveal that deep mantle-derived material is an important source for the ore-forming fluid. Pressure and temperature drop are likely the main ore precipitation mechanism at Zartorosht.\n\n\n(3).\nZartorosht is best classified as an orogenic-type Au deposit, which was formed in the main stage of the Afro-Arabia-Iranian microcontinent collision.\n\n\n\n\n","62":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nBanded iron formations (BIFs) are common in the Archean and Paleoproterozoic between ca. 3.5 and 1.8\u00a0Ga, and reappear again over a short time period in the late Neoproterozoic between ca. 0.8 and 0.6\u00a0Ga (e.g., Klein, 2005; Bekker et al., 2010; Gaucher et al., 2015). Very few BIFs occur in the interval of 1.8\u20130.8\u00a0Ga. In China, the early Neoproterozoic Shilu deposit, the early Mesoproterozoic Xuanlong iron deposit (Du et al., 1992), and the late Mesoproterozoic Jingtieshan iron deposit (Yang et al., 2015) all formed during this period. Globally, examples of Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic BIFs include the early Neoproterozoic Aok Formation and the late Mesoproterozoic Tomiko Terrane in Canada (Rainbird et al., 1994; Easton, 2005), and the early Mesopterozoic Sherwin and Corcoran Formation from the Northern Territory in Northern Australia (Bekker et al., 2010). These BIFs record valuable information about mechanisms of iron precipitation in relation to redox state of seawaters between the late Paleoproterozoic and the early Neoproterozoic.\nThe redox state of oceans is a major controlling factor in Fe precipitation (Bekker et al., 2010). In the Archean, oceans were anoxic and sulfate-poor (Klein, 2005; Planavsky et al., 2012) where iron (Fe2+) may be precipitated in response to mechanisms like anaerobic dissimilatory iron reduction by biological action (Heimann et al., 2010; Planavsky et al., 2012) or UV related photo-oxidation (Nie et al., 2017). Large amounts of BIFs were formed before a significant rise in oxygen content of the atmosphere (Holland, 2005; Bekker et al., 2010; Planavsky et al., 2012) following the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) at ca. 2.4\u00a0Ga. After the GOE, the early Paleoproterozoic oceans were stratified with anoxic bottom and oxidized shallower waters, where Fe precipitation was caused by oxidation at a dynamic redox interface (Planavsky et al., 2009; Planavsky et al., 2012). The recurrence of BIFs in the Neoproterozoic is considered to be related to either oxidation of anoxic oceans created by the Snowball Earth events (Basta et al., 2011) or the development of oxidized oceans in which Fe-bearing fluids poured during the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent (Eyles and Januszczak, 2004; Stern et al., 2013). However, the iron precipitation mechanism and setting of the 1.8\u20130.8\u00a0Ga BIFs are unclear and require further investigation. Some scholars argue for a mildly oxidized (Holland, 2006) or entirely oxidized state for the oceans (Klein, 2005) since the late Paleoproterozoic, whereas others consider the deeper waters to be anoxic or euxinic (anoxic and H2S-containing) until the Neoproterozoic (1.0\u20130.54\u00a0Ga) (Canfield, 1998; Canfield et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2009; Frei et al., 2013). The BIFs in this period provide a key to understand the changing processes of their formation through time.\nThe Shilu BIF-type deposit in Hainan Island, South China, was formed in the early Neoproterozoic between ca. 960 and 830\u00a0Ma (Xu et al., 2014). Due to the high grades (average FeO of 51\u00a0wt%) and large scale (proven Fe-ore reserves\u00a0>\u00a0500 Mt), many studies have been conducted to characterize the petrology, mineralogy, stratigraphy, geochronology, and geochemistry of the deposit (e.g., Xu et al., 2013, 2014; Yu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018). However, the genesis of the deposit is still debated. Some researchers suggest that it was formed by skarn processes (Zhao et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009) or hydrothermal events as indicated by the amphibolite facies metamorphism of the country rocks (Xu et al., 2008) and fluid inclusion composition of ores (Zhao et al., 2008). Other workers have argued for a sedimentary genesis as indicated by the presence as banded iron formations (Xu et al., 2013, 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018). Whether there are other factors that also contribute to the formation of the deposit, like glaciation akin to the Rapitan-type BIFs, rift\/volcanism like the Algoma-type BIFs, or even biological activity, deserves further consideration. Moreover, unraveling the genesis of the Shilu BIFs provides an opportunity to learn more about iron precipitation processes in the interval between 1.8 and 0.8\u00a0Ga as well as the redox state of the oceans.\nThe rare earth elements plus yttrium (REY) are commonly used to infer the sedimentary environments and iron provenances of BIFs based on the presence or absence of Ce, Eu and Y anomalies, and REE fractionation (e.g., Douville et al., 1999; Planavsky et al., 2010; Mendes et al., 2016). Iron isotopic ratios can also provide information about the redox state of seawater from which Fe precipitated. In this study, geochemical data (including Fe isotopes) from previous studies on the Shilu deposit are used to extract information on genesis of the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic BIFs.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nHainan Island is located in the southern margin of the South China plate (Li et al., 2008, 2014a; Shu, 2012) (Fig. 1\na). Sedimentary rocks only occupy 19.6% of the geology surface, and they include the Mesoproterozoic Baoban Group, early Neoproterozoic Shilu Group, Paleozoic strata, Mesozoic red beds, and Cenozoic clastic rocks (Fig. 1b). The Baoban Group comprises mainly schists, gneisses and amphibolites with partial migmatization. The Shilu Group consists of greenschist to amphibolite facies rocks which host the Shilu banded iron formations. The contact relationship between the Baoban and Shilu Groups is not exposed. The magmatic and stratigraphic sequences in the Hainan Island region were subjected to multiple tectono-thermal events (Xu et al., 2013, 2014; Wang et al., 2015) corresponding to orogenic movements such as the Grenvillian orogeny in the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic, the Caledonian orogeny in the end of the Early Paleozoic, the Indosinian orogeny in late Permian to Triassic, and the Yanshanian orogeny in the Jurassic to Cretaceous (Xu et al., 2014). The Shilu Fe deposit is temporally related to the Grenvillian orogeny that assembled the Precambrian Rodinian supercontinent.\n\n\n2.2\nDeposit geology\nThe Shilu iron deposit is located in the south of Changjiang City in the west part of Hainan Island (Fig. 2\n). The deposit is hosted in the early Neoproterozoic Shilu Group, a greenschist to lower amphibolite facies clastic-carbonate shelf succession. It is divided into seven litho-stratigraphic units (Fig. 3\n). The first, third, fourth, and fifth units consist mainly of quartz-mica schists, quartzites, and phyllites. The second unit comprises dolostones with minor skarns. The sixth unit, the main ore-host strata, is subdivided into three parts. The lower part comprises banded dolostones and pyroxene-amphibole rocks intercalated with minor quartz- or quartz-sericite schists, which contains Co-Cu mineralization. The Co-Cu mineralization is related to the Indosinian granite intrusion (Yu et al., 2014). The middle part is composed of banded dolostones and pyroxene-amphibole rocks (Fig. 4\na) intercalated with hematite-rich ore layers, and ferruginous phyllites and sandstones. The orebodies are lenticular or stratiform and contained mainly within three horizons, namely the first, second, and third Fe layers within the Beiyi syncline. The upper part consists of dolostones, limestones, and pyroxene-amphibole rocks. The seventh unit is a subordinate iron-bearing formation, which comprises quartzose sandstones, siltstones, quartzites, and phyllites (Fig. 4b). The sixth and seventh units contain macroscopic algal fossils such as Chuaria circularis Walcott, Shouhsienia shouhsienensis Xing, Tawuia dalensis Hofmann and T. sinensis Duan (Zhang et al., 1990), which together with detrital zircon ages (Wang et al., 2015) constrain the formation of the Shilu iron deposit to the early Neoproterozoic.\nBased on the mineral assemblages, the iron ores from the Shilu deposit are classified into three types, including Fe-rich and Fe-poor ores from the sixth unit, and Fe-poor ores from the seventh unit. The Fe-rich ores are termed quartz itabirites, which are composed of hematite and quartz with minor magnetite, barite, garnet and anhydrite. They display banded or massive structures (Fig. 4c). The Fe-poor ores from the sixth unit are termed amphibole itabirites and comprised of hematite, quartz, pyroxene and amphibole as well as minor magnetite, garnet, feldspar, barite and biotite, which exhibit a banded structure. The Fe-poor ores from the seventh unit are ferruginous sandstones, which exhibit a psammitic texture and bedding structure comprising alternating layers of hematite-rich and quartz-rich rocks (Fig. 4d).\n\n\n\n3\nGeochemical characteristics of iron ores\nThe analytical data used in this study are from previously published sources (Appendix A\u2013C). These include major and trace element data from sixteen iron-rich ore samples (quartz itabirite) and nine iron-poor ore samples (amphibole itabirite) (Xu et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2018), and Fe isotope ratio data from thirty-nine Fe ore samples including quartz and amphibole itabirites and ferruginous sandstones (Yu, 2016; Sun et al., 2018).\nThe quartz itabirites are rich in Fe2O3 (28.71\u201397.25\u00a0wt% averaged at 74.81\u00a0wt%), and SiO2 (1.92\u201368.22\u00a0wt% averaged at 19.91\u00a0wt%) with minor FeO (0.31\u201317.73\u00a0wt% averaged at 3.34\u00a0wt%) and trace abundances of Al2O3, TiO2, MnO2, Na2O, K2O, MgO, CaO, and P2O5, (<1\u00a0wt%). In contrast, the amphibole itabirites have lower concentration of Fe2O3 (16.30\u201377.84\u00a0wt% averaged at 37.37\u00a0wt%) and higher concentration of SiO2 (10.75\u201358.34\u00a0wt% averaged at 39.85\u00a0wt%). The other major element oxides exhibit relatively higher concentrations as FeO (0.69\u201315.22\u00a0wt% averaged at 7.41\u00a0wt%), Al2O3 (0.58\u20138.95\u00a0wt% averaged at 3.95\u00a0wt%), MgO (0.12\u20133.52\u00a0wt% averaged at 1.05\u00a0wt%), CaO (0.05\u201316.47\u00a0wt% averaged at 8.23\u00a0wt%) and K2O (0.03\u20133.40\u00a0wt% averaged at 1.08\u00a0wt%), but TiO2, MnO2, Na2O and P2O5 have typically lower concentrations (<1\u00a0wt%).\nCompared with the Post-Archean Australian shale (PAAS) (Taylor and McLennan, 1985), quartz itabirites have low rare earth element (REE) concentrations (0.82\u201344.45\u00a0ppm averaged at 14.47\u00a0ppm), and some samples show positive Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.78\u201311.01 averaged at 3.35). PAAS-normalized spider diagrams (Fig. 5\na) show a general left-sloped pattern with depleted light rare earth elements (LREEs) and flat medium rare earth element (MREEs) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). The amphibole itabirites also have low REE concentrations (7.25\u2013215.92\u00a0ppm averaged at 80.75\u00a0ppm) with a flat to mildly left-sloped pattern (Fig. 5b), and they have subtle positive Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.72\u20131.76 average at 1.28).\nThe \u03b457Fe values of iron ores in the sixth and seventh units display a gradual decrease in ratio from the bottom to the top. The \u03b457Fe values from the bottom Fe ore layer of the sixth unit have positive values of 1.57\u20132.41\u2030 with an average of 1.92\u2030. The middle Fe ore layer shows positive but lower \u03b457Fe values (0.44\u20130.79\u2030 with an average of 0.56\u2030). The upper Fe ore layer is enriched in lighter Fe isotope (\u03b457Fe: \u22120.43 to 0.59\u2030 with an average of 0.29\u2030). Fe ores from the seventh unit exhibit the most negative \u03b457Fe values from\u00a0\u22120.14 to \u20130.88\u2030 with an averaged of\u00a0\u22121.03\u2030.\n\n\n4\nThe genesis of the Shilu BIFs\n\n4.1\nDetrital contamination of the Fe ores\nAs chemical precipitates, the Shilu BIFs are enriched in Si and Fe elements, and they are depleted of the other major elements. Most Neoproterozoic BIFs worldwide generally contain clastic contaminants (Ilyin, 2009; Cox et al., 2013; Stern et al., 2013), and the Shilu BIFs are no exception. The detrital component is clearly reflected in the Al and Ti concentrations that show a positive correlation with a coefficient (r) of 0.80 in the amphibole itabirites (Fig. 6\na) and 0.62 in the quartz itabirites (Fig. 6b). Al and Ti are usually positively correlated to one another in terrigenous sedimentary rocks, because their concentrations are not changed by geological processes such as weathering or hydrothermal alteration. Detrital contamination is reflected in the Y\/Ho ratios of the amphibole itabirites (25\u201334 averaged at 28) and the quartz itabirites (24\u201340 averaged at 31). These ratios are clearly lower than those found in normal modern seawaters (>48.8, Alibo and Nozaki, 1999), and they are interpreted as being produced by the addition of terrigenous materials that have a much lower Y\/Ho ratio (~26, Bolhar et al., 2004). This interpretation is confirmed by the negative correlation between Y\/Ho and Al2O3 (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.84) for the amphibole itabirites (Fig. 6c) and between Y\/Ho and Zr for the quartz itabirites (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u22120.61, Fig. 6d), because the Al as well as some trace elements (e.g. Zr, Cr, Nb, etc.) are enriched in terrigenous sediments. In summary, the Shilu BIFs exhibit some evidences for the detrital contamination, and it is particularly evident for the amphibole itabirites.\n\n\n4.2\nSource of the Shilu BIFs\nThe concentrations of REE plus Y are widely used to interpret the formation of the BIFs. Surface and deep seawaters, and low- and high-temperature hydrothermal fluids all show different PAAS-normalized (REYPAAS) patterns (e.g., Zhang and Nozaki, 1996; Bau and Dulski, 1999). For example, the REYPAAS pattern of modern seawaters is typically left-sloped with negative Ce and positive Y anomalies, whereas high-hydrothermal fluids show a gently convex up REYPAAS pattern with positive Eu anomaly.\nFor the Shilu deposit, the PAAS-normalized REE plus Y patterns of amphibole itabirites show a flat pattern indicating that detrital material like PAAS constitutes a dominant component. The ratios of the LREE\/HREE have a discrete distribution with (Sm\/Yb)PAAS ratios ranging from 0.57 to 1.09 averaged at 0.92, which is ascribed to dilution by seawaters as inferred from gently left-sloped patterns of some samples. The absence of Ce (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a00.92 to 1.83 with an average of 1.14) and Y (\u03b4Y\u00a0=\u00a00.87 to 1.16 with an average of 0.95) anomalies rules out a major role for seawater in the formation of the ores. Eu generally shows a slight positive anomaly (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.72 to 1.73, average at 1.25) with no systematic variation relative to adjacent elements (Fig. 5b), which indicates no significant contribution from high-temperature hydrothermal fluids. The distribution patterns of REE plus Y indicate the extent of mixing of terrigeneous materials with lesser contributions from seawaters and low-temperature hydrothermal fluids.\nQuartz itabirites have low REE plus Y concentrations and left-sloped pattern ((Sm\/Yb)PAAS ratios range from 0.13 to 1.30, with an average of 0.47). This indicates that in addition to terrigenous materials as evidenced by detrital quartz and zircon, there are contributions from seawater (Bau and Dulski, 1996) (Fig. 5a). Unlike seawaters, quartz itabirites do not have the Ce anomaly (\u03b4Ce\u00a0=\u00a00.71 to 2.13, average at 1.11) and Y anomaly (\u03b4Y\u00a0=\u00a00.80 to 1.22, with an average\u00a0=\u00a00.94). High-temperature hydrothermal fluids usually have strong positive Eu anomalies (Bau and Dulski, 1999; Ghosh and Baidya, 2017). Quartz itabirites have positive Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.77 to 10.79, average at 3.14). However, high-temperature hydrothermal fluids exhibit fractionation of the HREEs (Bau and Dulski, 1999), so a negative correlation between \u03b4Eu and Lu\/Ho is expected, which is not found in the Shilu ores (Fig. 7\na). The positive Eu anomalies may be produced by the enrichment of Eu-rich minerals, such as magnetite, feldspar, and barite. The magnetite from Archean BIFs shows a strong positive Eu anomaly and enrichment in HREEs on spider diagram of REYPAAS (Ghosh and Baidya, 2017). However, in the Shilu BIFs, \u03b4Eu does not show any correlation with Fetotal (r\u00a0=\u00a00.09) or LREE\/HREE (r\u00a0=\u00a00.16), so the Eu anomalies are not caused by iron oxide. Moreover, due to the weak correlation of \u03b4Eu and Al2O3 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.12), feldspar cannot explain this variation. Barite can give rise to a positive Eu anomaly and thus may partly affect the shape of the REE pattern (e.g. Morgan and Wandless, 1980; Dekov et al., 2006; Lash, 2015). The \u03b4Eu and Ba display a strong positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75, Fig. 7b), indicating that the Eu anomalies are related to barite, rather than high-temperature hydrothermal fluids.\nThe presence of barite ore bodies associated with iron ore bodies in the sixth unit further constrains the genesis of the Shilu BIFs. These barite-bearing ore bodies have a stratified form that can be locally up to 1\u00a0m thick (SCISTCAS, 1986), indicating formation by sedimentary processes. The barite is unlikely to be derived directly from seawaters due to the minimal solubility of Ba in seawater. In addition, the presence of carbonates in the Shilu deposit is inconsistent with this model because witherite would be produced instead of barite in a carbonate-rich environment. It is likely that barium from hydrothermal fluids was added into sulfate-rich seawater to form barite or that the barite was directly derived from low-temperature hydrothermal fluids (Hanor, 2000; Huston and Logan, 2004). We interpret the data to indicate that the Shilu BIFs are the result of mixture of seawaters, low-temperature hydrothermal fluids, and terrigenous debris.\n\n\n4.3\nSedimentary environment and origin of the Fe isotope variations\nBased on the stability of Fe isotope ratios during metamorphism, iron isotope can be used to identify the source of metal and formation processes of BIFs (Dauphas et al., 2004; Frost et al., 2007). It has been generally accepted that Fe must be transformed from valence 2+\u00a0to 3+\u00a0in order to precipitate from solutions (Ewers, 1983; Walker, 1984; Gaucher et al., 2004; Kleint et al., 2017). The typical reaction path follows Fe2+\naq\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Fe3+\naq\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Fe-OH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Fe2O3 (Halverson et al., 2011). This process, which may be either biological (Croal et al., 2004; Balci et al., 2006) or abiotic (Staton et al., 2006), can give rise to a Fe isotope fractionation (\u039457Fe) of ca. 4.1\u20134.5\u2030 from Fe2+\naq to Fe3+\naq at 20\u00a0\u00b0C (Johnson et al., 2002; Welch et al., 2003; Anbar et al., 2005) and ca.\u00a0\u22122 to\u00a0\u22123\u2030 from Fe3+\naq to Fe(OH)3 (Skulan et al., 2002, Beard and Johnson, 2004). The total fractionation may reach ca. 1.4\u20132.4\u2030 from aqueous Fe2+ to final hematite (Johnson and Beard, 2006).\nIn the Shilu deposit, iron isotopic fractionation reaches up to 3.55\u2030 (the minimum and maximum values of \u03b457Fe are\u00a0\u22121.14\u2030 and 2.41\u2030, respectively), which is >2.4\u2030 of total fractionation (Fig. 8\n). Under oxidized conditions, all of the Fe2+ will be converted to ferric oxides at once, which is a rapid reaction process consuming hours to days (Halverson et al., 2011). This process would cause no significant iron fractionation, so the \u03b457Fe value is close to that of hydrothermal fluids (\u03b457Fe \u2248 \u22120.70 to 0\u2030) (e.g., Beard et al., 2003; Beard and Johnson, 2004; Severmann et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2008; Halverson et al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2016). Due to the low solubility of Fe2+ (about 20\u00a0mg\/L), the formation of large-scale Fe deposits requires that the iron reservoir must have been continuously replenished (e.g., Ewers, 1983). Under anoxic environments, partial oxidation makes the precipitate be rich in heavy iron isotope contrasted to the residual, which will result in a significant fractionation of iron isotope.\nThere are two potential models that can explain the Fe isotopic fractionation in the Shilu deposit. One is an overall anoxic environment where intermittent or batched oxidation results in the fractionation of iron isotopes to make seawaters enrich in light Fe isotope. This kind of seawater will mix with new-added Fe-bearing fluids and thus dilute them so as to deposit Fe-bearing minerals with increasingly lighter Fe isotope ratios (Fig. 8). This scenario requires a very delicate balance between supply and precipitation of iron such that the supply is not enough to overwhelm the 57Fe-depleted reservoir thereby homogenizing the isotopic signal. Another possibility is a redox-stratified water body with increasingly oxidized shallower layer. This model has been suggested to interpret the iron isotope gradient in the early Cryogenian Rapitan Group (Halverson et al., 2011). In this model, redox fractionation will create a water column with progressively lighter Fe upwards through the water column. Iron-bearing minerals with lighter isotope will deposit from the upper oxidized water layer, whereas Fe minerals with heavier isotope will deposit from the deep anoxic sea bottom. A gradual shift in \u03b457Fe occurs through the Shilu deposit, where the Fe ore layers form from deep water to create positive \u03b457Fe ratios. Ferruginous sandstones that deposit from relatively shallower water exhibit negative \u03b457Fe ratios. Both hypotheses support a conclusion that the Shilu iron deposit is precipitated in a redox stratified water in which partial Fe2+ is oxidized into Fe3+ resulting in Fe isotope fractionation.\n\n\n4.4\nThe genesis of the Shilu BIFs\nIt is generally accepted that the temporal variation in genesis of BIFs is related to secular evolution of the Earth\u2019s environment (Bekker et al., 2010), in particular the oxygen concentration in the ocean. In the Archean to early Paleoproterozoic, Algoma-type BIFs were deposited in anoxic oceans, which occurred as iron-rich horizons interlayered with submarine volcanic rocks in greenstone belts (Klein, 2005; Bekker et al., 2010). The iron was derived from periodic hydrothermal exhalation related to submarine volcanism to form regular silicon-iron BIFs (Bekker et al., 2010; Li et al., 2014b). After the Great Oxidation Event, the oxygen level in the oceans was elevated such that the water body was stratified with more oxidized upper layer (Klein and Beukes, 1989). A large amount of Fe2+ in the anoxic bottom was brought by upwelling or overturning into the oxidized surface waters (Klein, 2005) where the Fe2+ was transformed to Fe3+, and then precipitated. Although there are other proposed processes such as anaerobic biological dissimilatory iron reduction (Heimann et al., 2010; Planavsky et al., 2012), and UV photo-oxidation (Nie et al., 2017), this hypothesis applies to most of the Superior-type BIFs formed after the early Paleoproterozoic. In the Neoproterozoic, the oceans may be entirely oxidized (Huston and Logan, 2004; Klein, 2005), largely oxidized (Canfield et al., 2008) or anoxic (Canfield, 1998; Canfield et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2009; Frei et al., 2013). In order to decipher the metallogeny of BIFs from this period, a snowball Earth model is suggested in which the oceans were frequently covered by an ice sheet such that anoxic water bodies were produced. Abundant Fe2+ accumulated in the deep seawaters was transported to the shallow seawater and precipitated after the glacial events (Halverson et al., 2011; Kunzmann et al., 2017). This hypothesis is used to interpret Rapitan-type BIFs. An alternative model pertaining to the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent considers that the iron-bearing hydrothermal fluids related to rift-related mafic magmas mixed with oxidized seawaters to form Algoma-type BIFs (Volkert et al., 2010; Basta et al., 2011; Freitas et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2013). Such examples include the Jucurutu Formation in NE Brazil (Sial et al., 2015), the Egyptian BIFs in Egypt (Khalil and El-Shazly, 2012), the ANS BIFs in Saudi Arabia and Egypt (Stern et al., 2013), and the Tianhu iron deposit in NW China (Yu et al., 2018).\nIn the Shilu deposit, no evidence exists for contemporaneous glaciation or volcanism and thus excludes the model applied to the Rapitan- or Algoma-type BIFs. The main strata hosting the Shilu Fe ores comprise clastic rocks and carbonates (Xu et al., 2013) that were formed at a passive continental margin (Yu et al., 2016). The clastic rocks of the seventh units are well-sorted with high textural maturity (Yu et al., 2016). The sixth units contain zircon grains with high roundness (Wang et al., 2015), oolitic texture (Xu et al., 2014), and macro-algae fossils (e.g. Chuaria circularis Walcott and Tawuia dalensis Hofmann) (Zhang et al., 1990), which all indicate that the country rocks (i.e., the Shilu Group), were deposited in a shallow shelf environment. These features are consistent with the Superior-type BIFs such as the Neoproterozoic BIFs in the Arroyo del Soldado Group in Uruguay (Gaucher, 2000; Gaucher et al., 2003, 2004; Frei et al., 2013).\nIron isotopes data indicate a stratified water body for the Shilu BIFs analogous to the modern Red Sea (Blanc and Anschutz, 1995). The PAAS-normalized patterns of REE plus Y are in support of ore-forming materials coming from low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. Given the limited solubility of barite, the abundant barite could represent proximal sediments, indicating a nearby exhalation system like white smokers located in faults (Huston and Logan, 2004). Therefore, the Shilu deposit is probably formed from low-temperature hydrothermal fluids vented into a redox-stratified water body in the basin of the passive continental margin.\nThe genesis of the Shilu BIFs, therefore, is different from other BIFs formed in the 1.8 to 0.8\u00a0Ga globally. For example, the early Mesoproterozoic Xuanlong iron deposit in the Chuanlinggou Formation in the North China craton was formed through biological oxidation (Du et al., 1992; Li and Zhu, 2012). The Mesoproterozoic Jingtieshan BIFs were formed in an oxidized ocean, which exhibit strong positive Eu anomalies and sedimentary-exhalative features (Yang et al., 2015). Weathering-related Fe leaching and enrichment is responsible for iron ores from the Sherwin and Corcoran Formations (ca. 1.49\u00a0Ga) in Northern Territory, Northern Australia (Abbott and Sweet, 2000). The Constance Range ironstones in the Train Range Member of the Mullera Formation (ca. 1.49\u00a0Ga, Bekker et al., 2010) in the South Nicholson basin of Queensland, were formed by the leaching and oxidation of siderite-rich strata during lateritization (Taylor, 1973). The early Neoproterzoic BIFs in the Aok Formation of Canada (Rainbird et al., 1994), which are contemporaneous with the Shilu BIFs, are associated with the rare tectono-hydrothermal activity (Sun et al., 2018). Sun et al. (2018) also argued that the Shilu iron formation and the Aok iron formation were deposited in the same paleotectonic setting and recorded a depositional event in the early Neoproterozoic. However, the C-O isotopic compositions from them are notably different. The Shilu BIFs show \u03b413CV-PDB and \u03b418OV-SMOW values of\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.4\u20132.5\u2030 and 4.7\u201323.3\u2030 respectively (Xu et al., 2013), whereas the Aok iron Formations have homogeneous isotopic compositions (\u03b413CV-PDB values of 1.96\u20133.15\u2030, \u03b418OV-SMOW values of\u00a0\u22129.51\u2030 to\u00a0\u22127.14\u2030, Jones et al., 2010). Therefore, each BIF-type deposit formed during the 1.8\u20130.8\u00a0Ga period is unique and caution should be exercised when comparing the geochemical characteristics of the Shilu BIFs with other BIFs.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\n\n\n\n1.\nMajor and REE plus Y element geochemical characteristics indicate that the ores are precipitated from sea waters with a component of terrigenous clastic materials.\n\n\n2.\nThe notable positive Eu anomalies displayed by some ore samples are ascribed to abundant barite, which means iron coming from low- rather than high- temperature hydrothermal fluids.\n\n\n3.\nFe isotopes show an apparent fractionation from the bottom up in the sequence of the sixth and seventh units, which is contributed to a stratified ocean environment with an oxygen-rich upper layer.\n\n\n4.\nThe Shilu BIFs are regarded as being formed in a passive continental margin that may contain extensional faults acting as passages for hydrothermal fluids to vent into overlying seawater.\n\n\n5.\nCompared with those BIFs formed in the Archean-early Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic, each BIF-type deposit formed during 1.8\u20130.8\u00a0Ga exhibits unique characteristics and genesis as exemplified by the Shilu BIFs.\n\n\n\n\n","63":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposits supply >25% of the world's Zn and Pb production (Emsbo, 2009), e.g. the Australian McArthur River (HYC), (Large et al., 2005), and Mt Isa (Rieger et al., 2020), with other major deposits including the Selwyn Basin, Yukon (Gadd et al., 2015; Magnall et al., 2016). SEDEX deposits are hosted mainly by clastic sedimentary rocks (Leach et al., 2005), and form close to the seawater-sediment interface (SWI), in oxygen deficient and organic matter-rich environments (Slack et al., 2004; S\u00e1ez et al., 2011). SEDEX deposits are formed from oxidized, H2S-poor and metal-bearing brines generated in hydrothermal reservoirs (Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007). Hydrothermal discharge to the sub-seafloor occurs via extensional faults, leading to precipitation of syn-sedimentary and\/or early diagenetic stratiform, stratabound or discordant orebodies (Leach et al., 2010). Bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR), may be the main reduced sulfur source (Goodfellow, 1987; Magnall et al., 2016). In this SEDEX model, Pb and Zn sulfide precipitation occurs when bacterially produced H2S, diffusing upward from anoxic sediment, reacts with Pb-Zn-bearing chloride complexes in the ore-forming fluid (Large et al., 2002; Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007).\nSEDEX systems are typically long-lived, mostly focused at discrete vent sites in, or at least linked somehow to, faults (Large et al., 2002; Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007). Furthermore, hydrothermal activity commonly continues after sulfide formation, producing widespread post-ore alteration halos extending for hundreds of metres into the stratigraphic hanging-wall sequence and up to several kilometres laterally from the deposit (Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007). Examples include those reported from the Sullivan deposit (Hamilton et al., 1982), Howards Pass in the Yukon (Goodfellow, 2004), Tom (Large, 1981), and Meggen (Gwosdz and Krebs, 1977).\nThese later and more dispersed hydrothermal products have been used to constrain sources of metals, fluid pathways and mixing sites as well as acting as a vectoring tool (Gregory et al., 2015; Mukherjee and Large, 2017). Fluid-mobile elements can form halos that are much broader than the primary mineralization footprint. In SEDEX systems several fluid-mobile elements have been proposed as vectors to aid exploration. For example, in the McArthur River deposit, a widespread Zn, Pb, and Tl halo hosted by pyritic black shale has been described (Large et al., 2000). In addition, a global database constrains metal sources and environmental conditions of sedimentary\/diagenetic black shale pyrite formation (Gregory et al., 2015; Large et al., 2017).\nNotwithstanding their metallogenetic and potential economic importance, SEDEX-related halos are poorly understood. For example, lithological and stratigraphic controls on halo distribution, both regionally and in each deposit, are unclear. Detailed pathways for metal-bearing fluids (e.g. faults, sediment porosity), and SEDEX traps are often unknown. The variation of redox conditions in the sedimentary\/diagenetic environment as a control on sulfide deposition is also uncertain.\nThe Navan deposit is the largest known Irish-type deposit in the Irish Midlands but also locally includes sub-economic halos, hosted by the overlying Thin Bedded Unit (Ford, 1996; Ashton et al., 2003; Ashton et al., 2015). These halos share many features with classic SEDEX deposits, including carbonaceous and clastic host rocks (Hitzman et al., 2002; Ashton et al., 2015) and laminated sulfides parallel to bedding (Ashton et al., 2018).\nThe most recent potentially economic discovery in the Navan area is the new Irish-type deposit known as Tara Deep, located\u00a0~2\u00a0km south of the Navan deposit (Fig. 1\n). With an inferred resource of 26.2 Mt grading 8.4% Zn and 1.6% Pb (Boliden Summary Report Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, 2020 Boliden Website), Tara Deep is mainly composed of sphalerite- and galena-rich stratabound lenses hosted by Tournaisian micritic limestones (Fig. 2\n). The whole Navan Irish-type system is unconformably overlain by the Fingal Group, a Vis\u00e9an deep marine succession (see Fig. 2 and Ashton et al., 2018). In the Tara Deep area, the Lower Vis\u00e9an succession includes the New-Thin Bedded Unit (N-TBU), which comprises alternating sequences of black shales, siltstones and calcarenites (Figs. 2 and 3\n) (Yesares et al., 2019). Within this unit, a broad geochemical dispersion halo has been identified showing a spatial link to the underlying micrite-hosted mineralization.\nThis work focuses on the genesis of the halo above the Tara Deep deposit. We describe the geology, mineralogy, mineral chemistry, in-situ S isotopes and O isotopes hosted by sulfide-rich cherts. These data are then evaluated in order to enhance understanding of how fossil hydrothermal systems operated, in terms of mineralizing fluid evolution, metal mobility and concentration mechanisms. This study serves to strengthen genetic models of both replacive and SEDEX mineralization and the possible genetic links between them. It also establishes robust criteria through which geochemical halos of major Irish-type deposits can be identified and used for mineral exploration.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Irish Midlands basement is dominated by a structurally complex package of Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary and igneous rocks. In the northeast midlands the Ordovician succession comprises shales, sandstones, tuffs, lavas, intrusives and conglomerates (Romano, 1980; Vaughan and Johnston, 1992) and is overlain by Silurian graywackes, sandstones, siltstones, and mud rocks (Vaughan, 1991). These Lower Palaeozoic rocks were deformed and metamorphosed during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean during the Caledonian orogeny (Derry et al., 1965; Leeder, 1982) and are interpreted as having been deposited on the microcontinent of East Avalonia (Fritschle et al., 2018).\nThe basement is unconformably overlain by the Lower Carboniferous succession which resulted from a south to north marine transgression associated with sedimentary basin development during crustal extension (Philcox, 1984; Phillips and Sevastopulo, 1986; Andrew, 1993; Strogen et al., 1996). The stratigraphy of the Lower Carboniferous of the area begins with the Navan Group, which represents a deepening depositional environment (Philcox, 1984; Philcox, 1989). Its lowermost beds comprise alluvial\/marginal marine clastic rocks of Tournaisian age, locally known as Red Beds (Philcox, 1984). These are succeeded by thick, shallow-water, marine carbonates, termed the Laminated Beds, Muddy Limestones and Pale Beds, and comprise mudstones, bioclastic and oolitic grainstones, sandy calcarenites and micrites (Andrew and Ashton, 1985; Anderson, 1990; Rizzi, 1993). These are succeeded by the uppermost rocks of the Navan Group, the Shaley Pales, which comprise shaley bioclastic calcarenites, calcsiltites, shales and sandstones. The Navan Group is overlain by the Cruicetown Group (Rees, 1992), which includes the Argillaceous Bioclastic Limestone (ABL) (Philcox, 1984) and overlying Waulsortian Mudbank Limestone, comprising pale grey micrites, wackestones and packstones (Strogen et al., 1990) (Fig. 2a).\nIn the Navan deposit, upper Tournaisian\u2013Lower Vis\u00e9an low-angle submarine slides and debris flows removed part of the earlier Lower Carboniferous sequence (Philcox, 1989) leading to an erosion surface termed the Navan Unconformity. This unconformity is overlain by a sedimentary breccia known as the Boulder Conglomerate (Boyce et al., 1983). The Boulder Conglomerate is overlain by the thick well-bedded Vis\u00e9an sequence of the Fingal Group (Fig. 2a). In the Navan area, this sequence is known as the Upper Dark Limestones (UDL) and comprises well-bedded calcarenites, lutites and silts (Rees,1987; Strogen et al., 1990).\nComprehensive studies of Irish-type deposits include those of Anderson et al. (1998), Fallick et al. (2001), Boyce et al. (2003), Wilkinson et al. (2005), Wilkinson and Hitzman (2015), Ashton et al. (2015), Torremans et al. (2018), Yesares et al. (2019). In general terms, these deposits are understood to have formed by replacement of Lower Carboniferous limestones at two distinct stratigraphic levels. Deposits in the northeastern Irish Midlands, are hosted mainly by clean carbonates in the Tournaisian limestone sequence (e.g., Navan; Ashton et al., 2015). Further to the south and west, deposits including Lisheen, Galmoy and Silvermines are hosted by dolomitized Waulsortian limestones (Hitzman et al., 2002; Wilkinson et al., 2005; Yesares et al., 2019). As a general rule, deposits are concentrated near normal faults, which are often associated with the development of Devonian \u2013 Carboniferous basins (Wilkinson and Hitzman, 2015). These networks of normal faults are widely accepted as pathways for ascending, warm, metal-bearing but relatively H2S-deficient hydrothermal fluids (Fallick et al., 2001; Gagnevin et al., 2012; Ashton et al., 2015), which had scavenged metal from the underlying Lower Palaeozoic basement (Mills et al., 1987; Everett et al., 2003; Wilkinson et al., 2005; Walshaw et al., 2006; Yesares et al., 2019). These mixed with cooler, hypersaline brines associated with dissolved sulfate, which was reduced to sulfide by BSR processes at or near the site of sulfide precipitation (Anderson et al., 1998; Blakeman et al., 2002; Ashton et al., 2015).\nThe Navan deposit is relatively well studied based mostly on structural, stratigraphic, petrologic and geochemical analyses of both the Main Orebody and South West Extension (SWEX) (Fig. 1) (Ashton et al., 1986; Anderson et al., 1998; Gagnevin et al., 2012; Ashton et al., 2015). In general, the deposits at Navan are associated with ENE-trending extensional faults associated with the development of the NW margin of the Dublin basin (Wilkinson and Hitzman, 2015; Ashton et al., 2015; Yesares et al., 2019), (Figs. 1\u00a0and\u00a02a). The deposits are hosted mainly by clean carbonates in the Tournaisian Pale Beds limestone sequence (Fig. 2a) (Anderson et al., 1998) and consist of stratabound bodies or lenses, composed mainly of sphalerite and galena (Anderson et al., 1998). At Navan, the occurrence of sulfide clasts in the overlying Boulder Conglomerate indicates a Lower Vis\u00e9an minimum age for the mineralization (Fig. 2a) (Ford, 1996; Ashton et al., 2003; Ashton et al., 2015).\n\n\n3\nSamples and methods\nThe geological observations presented here have been carried out during exploration drilling at the Tara Deep deposit conducted by Boliden Tara Mines. About 270 samples were obtained from 19 previously logged drill cores which encompass all the differentiable lithofacies, mineralization styles and host rocks.\nAbout 200 samples of mineralized core drilled from the Lower Vis\u00e9an syn-rift UDL sequence overlying the Tara Deep deposit were prepared as polished thin sections for petrographic study by transmitted and reflected light microscopy at University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland. Of these, 120 samples were used for detailed mineralogical and textural studies using a SEM-EDS JEOL JMS-5410 equipped with a Link Oxford microanalyzer in UCD.\nEight polished sections containing sulfides were selected for electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) at the University of Huelva, Spain. The chemical compositions were determined using a JEOL JXA-8200 Super Probe Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer. The measurements were performed on carbon-coated polished sections using an accelerating voltage of 20\u00a0kV, with 20nA beam current, 30\u00a0s counting time for the peaks and 10\u00a0s for the background measurements. The spots analyses were selected using backscattered electron (BSE) images. Concentrations of Ag, Sb, Cd, Bi, Te, As, Mo, Sn, Co, Se, Ni, Au, Cu, Zn, Fe, Pb, Hg and S in sulfides were determined by wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). Up to 83 EPMA analyses of sulfides have been obtained. Routine data reduction, including full matrix (ZAF) corrections, were performed. The X-ray lines employed were K\u03b1 for S, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn; M\u03b1 for Hg, Au, Pb and Bi; L\u03b1 for Te, Sn, Mo, As, Ag, Se and Sb; and L\u03b2 for Cd. The standard materials and corresponding detection limits for each analysed element were as follows: Ag (Ag), 120\u00a0ppm; Sb (Sb2S3), 270\u00a0ppm; Cd (CdTe), 120\u00a0ppm; Bi (Bi2S2), 120\u00a0ppm; Te (CdTe), 120\u00a0ppm; As (Zn3As2), 220\u00a0ppm; Mo (Mo), 100\u00a0ppm; Sn (SnSe) 100\u00a0ppm; Co (Co), 100\u00a0ppm; Se (SnSe), 300\u00a0ppm; Ni (Ni), 100\u00a0ppm; Au (Au), 120\u00a0ppm; Cu (Cu), 140\u00a0ppm; Zn (ZnS), 140\u00a0ppm; Fe (FeS2), 110\u00a0ppm; Pb (PbS), 400\u00a0ppm; Hg (HgTe), 120\u00a0ppm; and S (FeS2), 50\u00a0ppm. Sample concentrations below these detection limits are not presented. Minimum, maximum and mean concentrations were calculated using only analyses having values above the detection limited.\nIn situ laser ablation S isotope analyses were made on polished blocks of 19 sulfide-rich N-TBU samples, selected on the basis of the petrological study. The analyses were made using the techniques of Kelley and Fallick (1990), Kelley et al. (1992) and Wagner et al. (2002). Data reduction and details of the calculation of the small (typically\u00a0<\u00a01\u2030) laser-induced fractionation is discussed in detail in Kelley and Fallick (1990), Fallick et al. (1992) and Wagner et al. (2002). The polished blocks were inserted into a laser chamber which was evacuated and subsequently filled with an excess of oxygen gas. A Spectron Laser 902QCW Nd:YAG laser (1\u00a0W power) then facilitated combustion of the sulfide within a\u00a0~50 \u00b5m diameter spot, which was then tracked across each sulfide until enough gas had been accumulated for mass spectrometric analysis (Fallick et al., 1992). The released SO2 gas was purified in a standard S vacuum extraction line, on-line to the mass spectrometer. Determination of the S isotope composition of the purified SO2 gas (\u03b466SO2) was carried out using a VG SIRA II gas mass spectrometer, monitored and calibrated using standards NBS-123 (17.1\u2030), IAEA-S-3 (\u201332\u2030) and the internal lab standard, CP-1 (-4.6\u2030). Sixty-seven S isotope compositions were calculated relative to Ca\u00f1on Diablo Troilite (CDT) and are reported in standard \u03b434S notation. Reproducibility based on complete duplicate analyses (including combustion) was better than\u00a0\u00b10.3\u2030.\nAn oxygen isotope study on 9 quartz grains from banded sulfide-bearing cherts from the N-TBU was also completed at SUERC. O isotope ratios were measured on 1\u00a0mg aliquots of sample by the laser fluorination method of Sharp (1990) as modified for chlorine trifluoride by Macaulay et al. (2000). A carbon dioxide laser acting as a controlled and localizable heat source was used to bring the quartz to incandescence whereupon it reacted with the atmosphere of fluorinating reagent and released oxygen. The oxygen was purified cryogenically and by passing through an in-line Hg diffusion pump from where it was transferred to the vicinity of a heated rod of platinized graphite. The resultant carbon dioxide was transferred to a capacitance manometer where the chemical yield was measured as a monitor of complete reaction. Data are reported in the conventional \u03b418O notation relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (V-SMOW). Analysis of an international silicate reference standard NBS 28 quartz gives \u03b418O=+9.6\u2030V-SMOW and the precision for isotopically homogeneous material is\u00a0\u00b10.2\u2030 or better at one sigma. Crystallization temperatures were modelled from quartz-water fractionation curves using the equation of Matsuhisa et al. (1979).\n\n\n4\nGeology of the Tara Deep deposit\nTara Deep is located\u00a0~2\u00a0km south of the Navan deposit, at a depth of 1.1\u20131.9\u00a0km (Figs. 1\u00a0and\u00a02a).\n\n4.1\nStratigraphy\nIn the Tara Deep area, the Carboniferous stratigraphic succession comprises the Tournaisian basal limestone sequence, which forms part of the Navan Group, overlain by the Vis\u00e9an marine succession comprising the Fingal Group (Fig. 2a).\nThe lower parts of the pre-rift Tournaisian stratigraphy resemble those reported in the Navan deposit (Ashton et al., 2018), including the marginal marine to shallow water deposits of the Navan Group, such as Red Beds, Laminated Beds, Muddy Limestone, micrites and dolomitized calcarenites and oolites (Fig. 2). Unlike at Navan, these are overlain by a succession of massive grainstones (Philcox, unpublished). The beginning of major rifting in the area, associated with the formation of the Dublin Basin (Ashton et al., 2015), led to uplift of the Navan Group footwall and consequent gravitational instability resulted in low-angle slides and sedimentary breccias. Denudation of the Navan and Cruicetown groups led to\u00a0~500\u00a0m of pre-rift stratigraphy being removed (Fig. 2).\nFurther collapse events at Tara Deep are recorded by the deposition of polymict breccias, higher in the stratigraphy, interpreted as a succession of submarine debris flows and fault-talus breccias (Fig. 2). The polymict Basal Sedimentary Breccia (BSB), is stratigraphically the lowest breccia and is composed of heterometric clasts from a few centimeters to several meters (Fig. 2b), including Waulsortian limestone clasts\u00a0>15\u00a0m in drill-core and with occasional Pale Beds fragments (Fig. 2). To the NW of the Tara Deep deposit, there is a distinctly different sedimentary breccia termed the S Fault Conglomerate (SFC). Here, the most common clasts are Pale Beds with only minor Waulsortian limestone (Fig. 2b). The relationship between the BSB and SFC remains unclear.\nThe SFC and BSB (Fig. 3a) are overlain by the N-TBU of the UDL, which includes the higher lenses of polymict submarine debris flows interbedded with distal calc-turbidites and shales (Fig. 2b and 3b-h). The N-TBU at Tara Deep ranges between 120 and 600\u00a0m in thickness and can be divided into four distinct facies separated by sedimentary breccias. N-TBU-4 is currently the lowest recognised member and is broadly equivalent to the more regional Tober Colleen Formation. Its maximum thickness is currently unknown, and it is dominated by occasionally burrowed, dark grey to black, massive, argillaceous micrites. A poorly preserved, polymict sedimentary breccia (SB-4), separates N-TBU-4 from the overlying N-TBU-3 and comprises Waulsortian and Pale Beds fragments cemented by black lutites (Fig. 2b) The overlying N-TBU-3 consists of a sequence of laminated black shales and silts (Fig. 3c). Another polymict sedimentary breccia (SB-3) (Fig. 3b), separates N-TBU-3 from N-TBU-2 which again comprises laminated shales and silts but now showing both nodular and boudinage textures (Fig. 2b and e). SB-2 overlies N-TBU-2 and hosts coarse Waulsortian and Pale Beds clasts encompassed by dark lutites, as well as large rafts of N-TBU-4 and N-TBU-3 (Fig. 2b and d). The uppermost N-TBU-1 consists of centimetric fining-upward sequences of bedding parallel alternating layers of calcarenite, calcsiltite and black shales (Fig. 3g and h). The lower part of the N-TBU-1 includes a cm-scale tuffaceous horizon, and the stratigraphically highest sedimentary breccia (SB-1) (Fig. 2b, f and h). SB-1 is composed mostly of irregular Pale Beds fragments cemented by argillite and silts (Fig. 2b and f). N-TBU-1 exhibits a gradational contact with the overlying Boudin Shale member of the UDL and is commonly marked by both reddish Mn staining (best observed in somewhat weathered core) and several lenses of banded sulfide-rich cherts, from 0.5 to 3\u00a0cm in thickness (Fig. 2b).\nThe part of the UDL overlying the N-TBU at Tara Deep is formed mainly of distal calc-turbidites and minor black shales resembling those in the wider Navan area (Fig. 2) (Philcox, 1984). Due to continuing extensional activity into the Middle Vis\u00e9an in the area (Ashton et al., 2015; Ashton et al., 2018), the whole UDL at Tara Deep is considered part of the syn-rift sedimentary record.\n\n\n4.2\nStructural features\nThe Tara Deep deposit lies between two major extensional structures, which formed part of the northern margin of the Dublin Basin during the Lower Vis\u00e9an. The ENE-trending G Fault forms the northern boundary, while the southern limit is defined by a larger structure, the sub-parallel Navan Fault, which has a displacement of at least 3\u00a0km (Ashton et al., 2018). The structural Gainstown Terrace formed by the Navan and G faults is dissected by the high-angle S fault, a NNW-striking, westerly dipping structure (Figs. 1 and 2) (Coller unpublished work; Ashton et al., 2018). A further terrace (the Navan Terrace), lies to the north between the G Fault and the similarly oriented P Fault. North of the P Fault is a distinct horst formed between the P and E Faults, the latter structure being a NW dipping major normal fault, locally forming the southern margin of the Southwest Extension of the Navan deposit (Figs. 1\u00a0and\u00a02a).\nBased on seismic and drilling data, the S Fault does not appear to significantly displace the Lower Vis\u00e9an Basal Sedimentary Breccia and associated erosion surface (Fig. 2b), and the N-TBU clearly drapes over the S Fault as in a monocline. This suggests that the S Fault was active before the deposition of lower UDL. Regionally, seismic data shows that the ABL thickens across extensional faults, strongly suggesting that was the point at which extension started to accelerate. It is therefore likely that the S Fault also initiated at that time. The G Fault is seen to displace significant thicknesses of N-TBU and records continued extension into the Vis\u00e9an. Due to inversion the exact history of the Navan Fault is unclear. Several low-angle faults can be interpreted from the drill-hole data that affect the Pale Beds. Locally observed shearing within the basal Navan Group may suggest structural contacts with the underlying Lower Palaeozoic basement (Fig. 2) (Ashton et al., 2018), although these are currently not fully defined.\n\n\n4.3\nMineralization styles\nMineralization at Tara Deep is unevenly distributed throughout the stratigraphy from the Lower Micrite to the N-TBU (Fig. 3). Based on the host rock, mineralogical and textural features, three different styles of mineralization can be distinguished:\n\n-\n\nZn-Pb mineralization hosted by the Pale Beds (Navan Group)\n\n\n\n\nThis comprises approximately 92% of the total resource at Tara Deep (Ashton et al., 2018). This part of the deposit shows a stratabound geometry, approximately 50\u00a0m in thickness. It is hosted by both the Lower and Upper Micrites and, where mineralization is strongest, by the intervening dolomite as well. Disposition is controlled by low-angled SE-dipping faults (Figs. 1 and 2).\nKey features are comparable with those previously reported for the Main Orebody and the SWEX (see Ashton et al., 2015 and references therein). The Lower Micrite hosts the highest grades comprising replacive sphalerite, galena, pyrite and marcasite. The Upper Micrite shows variable but lower grades dominated by sulfide veining. The mineralization hosted by the Pale Beds at Tara Deep is equivalent to the 5 Lens in the Main Navan Orebody, which hosts 70% of the pre-mining ore (Ashton et al., 2015).\n\n-\n\nZn-Pb mineralization hosted by the S Fault Conglomerate\n\n\n\n\nMineralization hosted by the SFC in the NW sector (Figs. 1 and 2) comprises approximately 8% of the total resource at Tara Deep. This SFC includes a significant amount of reworked mineralized clasts cemented by later sulfides (Figs. 3a and 4). Of crucial importance is that some of these detrital clasts occur in the conglomerate just above the mineralized horizons, thereby strongly suggesting that previously mineralized Pale Beds contributed to the load. This also suggests that the mineralizing episode spanned the formation of the S Fault Conglomerate, and that therefore a Lower Vis\u00e9an minimum age for the onset of mineralization at Tara Deep can be defined. This is comparable with the minimum age for the onset of mineralizing activity at the Navan deposit from similar evidence. Therefore, the mineralizing systems at both deposits remained active throughout the rifting event. Due to its location in the common hanging-wall of the G and S faults, the origin of this sedimentary breccia is interpreted as a proximal fault talus (Figs. 2\u00a0and\u00a03a). This mineralization is similar to that hosted by the Boulder Conglomerate in the Navan Deposit in the hanging-wall of the T Fault (Ashton et al., 2015).\n\n-\n\nMineralization hosted by the N-TBU\n\n\n\n\nAbout 200\u00a0m thick sub-economic mineralization has been identified in the overlying N-TBU (Figs. 2,\u00a03b-h and 5a-l). It comprises 0.5\u201315\u00a0cm thick bedding-parallel layers of framboidal pyrite, minor disseminated sphalerite and other rare sulfides extensively distributed throughout the N-TBU (Fig. 5\n\na-g). Here, associated bioclastic layers show a high degree of pyritization (Fig. 5h-k). In addition, minor replacive sulfides and sulfide-rich cherts have been observed, including chalcopyrite, galena and stibnite (Figs. 6 and 7\n\n). Similar to the Navan deposit, thin bands of sphalerite and galena occur near the base of the N-TBU, very close to the SFC, and laminated pyrite is also common in mudstone layers in the overlying Upper Dark Limestone. However, the vertical extent of this type of mineralization at Tara Deep is very much larger (100\u00a0s of meters). The better development of this mineralization style at Tara Deep may indicate a longer life for the mineralizing processes at this locality than elsewhere in the mineralizing system.\n\n\n\n5\nMineral assemblages\nThe syn-rift Lower Vis\u00e9an sedimentary rocks at Tara Deep host two main mineralization styles: (1) economic mineralization in the SFC (Figs. 2,\u00a03a and 4); (2) sub-economic mineralization hosted by the N-TBU, overlying the BSB and SFC (Figs. 2, 3b-f, 5, 6 and 7). Each of them comprises a variety of mineral associations detailed in sub-sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. Table 1\n (pyrite), Table 2\n (sphalerite) and Table 3\n (other minerals) summarize the ranges of mineral major and minor element compositions determined by EPMA. Full analytical data are provided in Appendixes 1, 2 and 3.\n\n5.1\nMineralized SFC\nClasts forming the breccia, including Pale Beds, Waulsortian Limestone and mineralized material, show dissolution-replacement textures, where irregular corroded clast edges have been replaced mainly by a newly formed generation of sulfides (Figs. 3a, 4a-f). This sulfide assemblage consists of marcasite, pyrite, sphalerite and galena (Fig. 4b-e and g-h), with minor chalcopyrite, siegenite, Co-pentlandite and stibnite (Fig. 4i and j).\nLater sulfides show a wide range of textures. Marcasite replaces pyrite and both minerals replace bioclasts and occur in colloforms and alternating microbands (Fig. 4a-e). Galena appears mainly as skeletal aggregates, colloforms, filling interstices in marcasite and pyrite aggregates, and as euhedral crystals including fine-grained exsolutions of stibnite and siegenite (Fig. 4d, h and i). Chalcopyrite occurs in small amounts intergrown with Co-pentlandite and cementing brecciated pyrite (Fig. 4j). Paragenetically late sphalerite appears infilling and replacing earlier marcasite, pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite and Co-pentlandite (Fig. 4d, h and j). In addition, colloform sphalerite has been observed associated with dolomite (Fig. 4g).\nPyrite shows slight enrichment in As, and a high Co\/Ni ratio, with a mean value of 2. Sphalerite is characterized by low Fe (mean 1.7\u00a0wt%) and high Cd (mean 0.3\u00a0wt%) displaying a mean Zn\/Cd ratio of 362. Siegenite contains low Ni (mean of 26.7\u00a0wt%) and high Co, Fe and Zn (mean values of 24.9, 6.1 and 0.95\u00a0wt%, respectively). Stibnite is notably enriched in metals and metalloids such as Sn, Fe, Pb, Bi, Se and As, with mean values of\u00a0>0.1\u00a0wt%.\n\n\n5.2\nMineralized N-TBU\nPetrographic analyses have revealed a texturally complex mineralogy, composed mainly of pyrite with subordinate marcasite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, stibnite, Co-pentlandite and siegenite (Figs. 5, 6 and 7). Calcite, ankerite, quartz and barite are the main gangue minerals associated with the sulfide phases. Based on their mineralogical and textural features, four sulfide assemblages have been identified:\n\n-\n\nLaminated pyrite\n\n\n\n\nThis is the major assemblage extending over a 200\u00a0m thickness of the N-TBU (Fig. 2b). Laminated pyrite is mostly composed of 0.5\u201315\u00a0cm thick bedding-parallel layers of pervasively disseminated pyrite and subordinate sphalerite, closely associated with black shales (Fig. 5a-e). This assemblage, where best developed, can comprise 2\u20133\u00a0m thick massive pyrite bodies, for example in the G fault hangingwall (Figs. 2b, 5f and g).\nPyrite occurs mainly as 5 to 50\u00a0\u03bcm framboidal aggregates, which are closely associated with relict mature organic matter (Fig. 5b). Framboidal textures have a very high degree of preservation (Fig. 5c), usually with little recrystallization. Occasionally, pyrite has been observed partially recrystallized to colloform texture (Fig. 5d) and euhedral crystals (Fig. 5g). Sphalerite occurs interstitially and replacing pyrite framboids (Fig. 5e). Barite is scarce in the N-TBU but has been recognized as late veinlets crosscutting the laminated pyrite (Fig. 5l).\nPyrite crystals show homogeneous composition. Pyrite is relatively enriched in Co (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.054\u00a0wt%) and exhibits a mean Co\/Ni ratio of 1.4. Sphalerite also exhibits homogeneous composition, including low Fe contents (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.17\u00a0wt%) and a low mean Zn\/Cd ratio of 268. No compositional zonation has been observed in SEM backscattered studies on pyrite.\n\n-\n\nPyritized fossils\n\n\n\n\nBioclasts forming the calcarenite and calcsiltite layers within the N-TBU show a high degree of pyritization (Fig. 5h). Pyrite and minor sphalerite occur as microfossil replacement, mainly of radiolaria and micro-foraminifera (Fig. 5i-k). This assemblage is widely distributed in the N-TBU, progressively decreasing upwards and closely associated with the laminated pyrite (Fig. 2b).\nPyrite replacing fossils in the N-TBU shows a comparable composition to framboidal laminated pyrite, except for Co and Ni, which show mean Co\/Ni ratio of 2. Sphalerite replacing bioclasts is characterized by low Fe and Cd contents (mean values of 1.2 and 0.2\u00a0wt%, respectively) and displays a mean Zn\/Cd ratio of 288. No compositional zonation has been observed in SEM backscattered studies on pyrite.\n\n\u2013\n\nReplacive assemblage\n\n\n\n\nThis is pervasively distributed throughout the N-TBU, but apparently spatially associated with the area above the intersection of the G and S faults (Fig. 2b). It occurs: (1) parallel to the bedding, in which sulfides are infilling primary porosity, replacing the sediments and overgrowing bioclasts (Fig. 6a-c); and (2) crosscutting the bedding and deforming the sediments and associated earlier laminated pyrite (Fig. 6a, d and e).\nThe sulfide suite is formed mainly by marcasite showing skeletal textures and\/or replacing fossils (Fig. 6c), and by massive pyrite (Fig. 6e and g). Subordinate sulfides consist of micrometric sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena and Co-pentlandite filling open spaces in marcasite and pyrite or replacing bioclasts (Figs. 6f-h, 7g-h).\nPyrite crystals show a homogeneous composition with a mean Co\/Ni ratio of 5. Sphalerite displays a low Fe content (mean\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0wt%) and a high Zn\/Cd mean ratio of 364. Chalcopyrite has homogeneous composition and is relatively depleted in trace elements. No compositional zonation has been observed in SEM backscattered studies on either pyrite or chalcopyrite.\n\n-\n\nBanded sulfide-rich cherts\n\n\n\n\nThese mainly comprise 0.5\u20133\u00a0cm thick quartz bands rimmed by coarse carbonates associated with sulfides (Fig. 7a). Banded sulfide-rich cherts are hosted in black shales which show a reddish alteration (Fig. 7b) linked to a high Mn content. They are found systematically at higher stratigraphic levels in N-TBU-1, just below and above the tuffaceous horizon (Fig. 2b). They are most abundant near and above the intersection of the G and S faults.\nOne of the critical features of the cherts is their relationship with the host sediments. Basal irregularities in the cherts can be seen to have deformed and depressed underlying sediments, whereas overlying sediments are conformably deposited over their tops (Fig. 7a).\nThe silica layers show textures such as microcrystalline and radial fibrous crystals comprising chalcedonic colloforms (Fig. 7c). Quartz includes fine inclusions of euhedral calcite and minor dolomite, both showing Mn enrichment in their crystal rims (Fig. 7d). Cherts are rimmed by Mn-rich calcite and dolomite linked to a sulfide assemblage including fine bird\u2019s-eye marcasite, 5\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm euhedral aggregates of pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and galena which contains very fine siegenite and stibnite inclusions (Fig. 7e-i). In addition, very fine inclusions of euhedral sulfides occur, mainly pyrite included within the cherts (Fig. 7a and d).\nPyrite is relatively depleted in trace elements, although the As content is high (up to 0.15\u00a0wt%), with mean Co\/Ni ratios of 6.5. Sphalerite is also relatively depleted in trace elements, including low Fe and Cd (means of 1.6 and 0.18\u00a0wt%, respectively), and Zn\/Cd ratios of 364. Significant trace elements in galena include Bi and Sb, with mean values of 0.22 and 1.68\u00a0wt%, respectively. Stibnite grains analysed in the chert rims show comparable Bi concentrations to galena (mean\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u00a0wt%). No compositional zonation has been observed in SEM backscattered studies on sulfides.\n\n\n\n6\nSulfide S isotope compositions\nThe sulfides hosted in the SFC and the N-TBU at Tara Deep have \u03b434S values that range from \u221239.2 to\u00a0+\u00a044.2\u2030 (Fig. 8\na and Table 4\n), but compositions vary strongly between different mineral associations (Fig. 8b).\nPublished S isotope analyses on marcasite (\u00b1pyrite) from the SFC matrix at Tara Deep (Fig. 4a-f) reveal high \u03b434S values, ranging from 12.1 to 24.6\u2030 (average of 17.3\u2030) (Yesares et al., 2019; Fig. 8b and Table 4). Furthermore, S isotope values reported from sulfides in a reworked mineralized clast (Fig. 4a and f) exhibit the typical bimodal distribution described in the micrite-hosted mineralization at both the Tara Deep and Navan deposits (Anderson et al., 1998; Yesares et al., 2019).\nLaminated pyrite (Fig. 5a, c, f and g) shows a wide range of low \u03b434S values, from \u221237.4 to 3.3\u2030 (mean of \u221224\u2030) (Fig. 8b). \u03b434S values and pyrite recrystallization degree show correlation in each sample. Early framboidal pyrite exhibits the lowest \u03b434S values, whereas recrystallized material displays the heaviest compositions (Fig. 5f and g). The \u03b434S values of interstitial sphalerite replacing framboids (Fig. 5e) are also low, with mean value of \u201332.4\u2030 (Fig. 8b).\nPyritized fossils in calcarenite layers (Fig. 5h, I and j) also have a broad range of \u03b434S values from \u201332.3 to 5.6\u2030 (mean of \u221213.2\u2030) (Fig. 8b), whereas sphalerite replacing fossils (Fig. 5k) shows homogeneous S isotope compositions, with a mean value of \u221211.8\u2030 (Fig. 8b).\nSulfides forming replacive assemblages show high \u03b434S values (Fig. 8b). Marcasite (\u00b1pyrite) (Fig. 6a-e and g) shows a wide range of higher \u03b434S values from 0 to 24.5\u2030 (mean of 18.6\u2030), whereas pyrite (\u00b1marcasite) varies from 4.9 to 15.3\u2030 (mean value of 9.2\u2030). One sphalerite grain in the replacive assemblage exhibits a \u03b434S values of 5.8\u2030 (Fig. 8b).\nMarcasite and pyrite associated with banded sulfide-rich cherts (Fig. 7a and f) exhibit variable, but systematically high, \u03b434S values from 10.1 to 44.2\u2030 (mean of 18.6\u2030) and 5.8 to 12.6\u2030 (mean of 9.6\u2030), respectively (Fig. 8b). It is worth noting that, due to the close textural links between both Fe sulfides (Fig. 7f), it was impossible to exclusively analyze pyrite or marcasite completely separately. The \u03b434S for sphalerite rimming the banded sulfide-rich cherts (Fig. 7g) ranges from 7.0 to 15.2\u2030 (mean of 10.5\u2030), while chalcopyrite and galena (Fig. 7g-i) show quite high \u03b434S values of 36.8 and 17.5\u2030, respectively (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n7\nO isotope composition of banded sulfide-rich cherts\nThe oxygen isotope compositions of banded sulfide-rich cherts exhibit \u03b418O values ranging from 23.7 to 26.3\u2030 (mean of 25.3\u2030) (Table 5\n). Slight vertical \u03b418O variations have been observed on cherts from different stratigraphic positions, the lowest values being obtained on the highest stratigraphically cherts just above the tuffaceous horizon.\nThe results are used to illustrate possible equilibrium fluid temperature conditions for chert crystallization, by construction of chert-water fractionation curves using the equation of Matsuhisa et al. (1979), shown in Fig. 9\n. We assume equilibrium with seawater with a \u03b418O value close to 0, following interpretation of C-O clumped isotope analyses that Lower Carboniferous seawater had a very similar isotopic composition to modern seawater (Henkes et al., 2018). Based on this model, chert crystallization temperatures may range from 65 to 80\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\n\n8.1\nTectono-sedimentary environment\nThe mineralizing processes at Tara Deep were intimately associated with the extensional setting (Fig. 2). Like the Navan deposit, the micrite-hosted mineralization at Tara Deep occurs near normal faults, which are assumed to be coeval with the development of the Dublin basin (Wilkinson and Hitzman, 2015; Ashton et al., 2015). The mineralizing fluid probably circulated through both the G and Navan faults, and via secondary porosity, resulting in the partial dissolution of earlier carbonates and the precipitation of epigenetic sphalerite and galena mineralization (Anderson et al., 1998; Yesares et al., 2019). At least part of the activity on these faults was coeval with Lower Vis\u00e9an sedimentation (Fig. 2b). Evidence of syn-sedimentary faulting includes the thickening of the SFC into the G Fault hanging-wall, which presents a similar relationship to that noted between the Boulder Conglomerate and extensional faults in the Navan deposit (Ashton et al., 2015).\n\n\n8.2\nDepositional environment\nTraditional SEDEX models propose organic-rich mudstones deposited in a bathypelagic, anoxic, restricted basin in which syn-sedimentary deposition of sulfides occurs in a stratified euxinic water column, for example the Black Sea (Goodfellow, 1987; Ozsoy and Unluata, 1997). However, recent models allow more energetic depositional conditions (Schieber et al., 2010; Magnall et al., 2020) beyond the restricted, euxinic basin model (Arthur and Sageman, 1994; Smith et al., 2019). At Tara Deep, the N-TBU stratigraphic record and sedimentary features, such as graded beds, cross laminations and black shales interbedded with siltstone laminae (Fig. 3b-h) are consistent with a non-euxinic low energy and deep marine depositional environment (Miall, 2016). However, the high amount of coarse framboidal pyrite replacing organic matter-rich fine laminae in black shales, that in general show an absence of bioturbation (Fig. 5a, b, c, fa and g), implies anoxic to lower sub-oxic conditions at least below the sediment\u2013water interface (Slack et al., 2004; S\u00e1ez et al., 2011; Wilkin et al., 1996; Bond and Wignall, 2010). The scarcity of barite in the N-TBU is consistent with oxygen-poor formation conditions, because the presence or absence of barite is controlled by the activity of sulfate in the water column or in connate waters. In anoxic basins, where all the sulfate has been reduced to sulfide, Ba carried by hydrothermal fluids will be dispersed because of a lack of sulfate to precipitate barite (Johnson et al., 2009 and references therein).\nThis anoxic environment was occasionally interrupted by the deposition of silts and calcturbidites (Fig. 3c, e and g). These can be interpreted as repeated incursions of oxygenated mass flows derived from a marginal shallow-water oxic environment to the deep-water anoxic environment of the basin floor, probably controlled by seismicity related to extensional faulting or by footwall fault scarp instabilities.\n\n\n8.3\nHydrothermal fluid input\nAlthough framboids are common in diagenetic muds (Taylor and Macquaker, 2000), both laminated pyrite and pyritized fossils hosted in the N-TBU at Tara Deep show evidence of hydrothermal influence. The large amount of Fe and minor Zn, where pyrite is partially replaced by sphalerite (Fig. 5a-g), is widespread for hundreds of metres into the stratigraphic hanging-wall sequence and up to\u00a0~2\u00a0km laterally (Fig. 2), and includes massive pyrite bodies (Fig. 2b, 5f and g). This high metal endowment required Fe and Zn supplied by hydrothermal fluids (Lydon, 2007).\nFurther evidence for hydrothermal activity during and just after N-TBU deposition is the identification of rare chalcopyrite and galena with stibnite and siegenite inclusions, and Co-pentlandite. These sulfides occur as late infillings, veinlets and variable replacive textures, all of them associated with the SFC matrix, banded sulfide-rich cherts and replacive assemblage (Figs. 4, 6 and 7). These assemblages are interpreted to have formed by the reaction of uprising hydrothermal fluids with both SFC-hosted clasts and laminated pyrite in the N-TBU, replacing the lower-temperature sedimentary sulfides by higher-temperature assemblages, consistent with depositional models elsewhere (Goodfellow et al., 1993; Turner, 1991; Kelley and Jennings, 2004). Moreover, open space filling sulfides in breccia matrices suggest that mineralizing fluids flowed throughout the still permeable sediments in early diagenetic stages (Fig. 4a and f; 6a, b and d). Similar high temperature assemblages have been reported linked to feeder zones in other SEDEX deposits, such as Rammelsberg, Tharsis, Sullivan and Red Dog (Large and Walcher, 1999; S\u00e1ez et al., 1999; Lydon et al., 2000; Kelley and Jennings, 2004).\nPyrite Co\/Ni ratios together with absolute values of Co may be suitable for discriminating sedimentary and hydrothermal ore deposits (Xu, 1998; Chowdhury and Lentz, 2017; Maghfouri et al., 2018). According to these authors, sedimentary pyrite has low Co\/Ni ratios (generally\u00a0<\u00a01) and\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0ppm Co, whereas hydrothermal pyrite is characterized by Co\/Ni\u00a0>\u00a01 and\u00a0>\u00a0400\u00a0ppm Co. Laminated framboidal pyrite at Tara Deep shows Co\/Ni ratios ranging from 0.3 to 4.5 and Co varying from 100 to 1120\u00a0ppm (Table 1 and Appendix 1). Although some framboidal pyrite Co\/Ni ratios have apparently sedimentary values (<1), most reflect hydrothermal influence (Co\/Ni\u00a0>\u00a01). Pyritized fossils have a narrow range of Co\/Ni values transitional between the sedimentary and hydrothermal pyrite fields and close to Co\/Ni\u00a0=\u00a01 (Table 1 and Appendix 1). This suggests that these pyritized fossils may have formed as a result of the dissolution of sedimentary pyrite by the hydrothermal fluid. All pyrites related to banded sulfide-rich cherts, the replacive association in N-TBU and SFC matrix (Figs. 4, 6 and 7) show Co\/Ni ratios ranging from 1.9 to 10 and Co varying from 220 to 1000\u00a0ppm (Table 1 and Appendix 1), suggesting a relatively warmer hydrothermal input.\nThe trace element composition of sphalerite also can be used to constrain the temperature of mineralization (Han, 1994; Gottesman and Kampe, 2007). According to Zhu, (1988), Liu et al. (2010), Li et al., (2008), sphalerite in stratabound Pb\u2013Zn deposits is rich in Cd, with Zn\/Cd ratios\u00a0>\u00a0300, and poor in Fe. In contrast, volcanic and magmatic hydrothermal Pb\u2013Zn deposits are rich in Fe, but poor in Cd, with Zn\/Cd ratios of\u00a0<\u00a0300. In general, all the measured sphalerites in both the SFC and N-TBU are Fe-poor (mean values ranging from 1.1 to 1.7\u00a0wt%; Table 2 and Appendix 2) and Cd-rich (mean Zn\/Cd ratios varying from 268 to 364), indicative of an overall low temperature of formation. However, sphalerite from SFC, banded sulfide-rich cherts and replacive association in N-TBU suggest a slightly higher precipitation temperature.\nLate sulfide suites in the SFC and N-TBU mineralization display high Bi contents in galena and stibnite (mean of 0.2\u00a0wt%) (Fig. 4h, I, 6e, h, 7\u00a0g, h and I; Table 3 and Appendix 3). Fleischer (1956) reported a positive correlation between Bi content in sulfides and increasing temperature of formation. Therefore patterns of high Bi content in sulfide matrix cementing SFC, sulfide-rich cherts and replacive association indicate higher temperatures.\nNumerous lenses of banded sulfide-rich cherts mark the N-TBU-1 upper contact with the overlying calc-turbidites of the Fingal Group (Figs. 2 and 7). These cherts occur as finely-laminated thin beds showing soft-sediment deformation (Fig. 7a and b) indicating early silicification at or near the water\u2013sediment interface. Silica, usually as chert, is ubiquitous in most stratiform ores and is in part hydrothermally derived (Yamamoto, 1987; Lei et al., 2019). The source of silica for chert remains problematic and its genesis has been attributed to a variety of processes, such as dissolution of biogenic siliceous remains (e.g., radiolarians, diatomite, sponge and spicules) (Boudreau, 1990); inorganic precipitation from solution (e.g., silica-rich thin-bedded cherts from hot spring waters) (Eker et al., 2012); from fluids related to submarine volcanism (Adachi et al., 1986; Hofmann and Bolhar, 2007); by direct precipitation from Si-oversaturated seawater in hydrothermal environments (Sugitani et al.,1998; Maliva et al., 2005; Tice and Lowe, 2006); or a mixture of both biogenic and inorganic sources (Van Van den Boorn et al., 2007; Van den Boorn et al., 2010; Marin-Carbonne et al., 2012).\nThe N-TBU-hosted, banded, sulfide-rich cherts are characterized by a lack of siliceous fossils (e.g. diatoms, radiolaria, etc.) and other biological relicts at SEM scale, making a biogenic origin unlikely. The modelled equilibrium fluid temperature of 65 to 80\u00a0\u00b0C for chert crystallization (Fig. 9) suggests that hydrothermal fluids were relatively warm but cooling by equilibration with seawater. Thus, silica could have precipitated directly from hydrothermal fluids to microcrystalline and botryoidal chalcedony fibres (Fig. 7c), retaining pre-existing dolomite rhombs (Fig. 7d). Moreover, the higher-temperature sulfide assemblage, e.g., chalcopyrite, siegenite, stibnite, galena (Fig. 7f-i), contained by the cherts, also supports relatively higher temperatures of precipitation. All these data suggest that the N-TBU-hosted cherts formed under the strong influence of hydrothermal fluids.\n\n\n8.4\nRole of faulting\nFaulting at Tara Deep exerted an important control on the mineralizing process during the Lower Vis\u00e9an. For example, although mineralized sediments are widespread within the N-TBU, the pyrite content increases towards the G fault (Figs. 2,\u00a05f and g), leading to massive pyrite lenses a few meters thick, suggesting that this structure acted as an important conduit for hydrothermal fluid flow at least during laminated pyrite formation. The higher temperature assemblages (e.g. stibnite, galena, chalcopyrite, siegenite and Co-pentlandite) (Figs. 4i, j, 6f-h and 7g-i) are also spatially associated with normal faults, and sulfide matrix cementing the SFC (Fig. 4i and j) overlies the S and G faults (Fig. 2). The N-TBU-hosted replacive association occurs as veins crosscutting the bedding (Fig. 6a and d) and filling open spaces in permeable calcarenite layers (Fig. 6a and b), increasing in abundance toward the intersection of G and S faults. Therefore, higher temperature assemblages provide evidence of sub-seafloor replacement by the mineralizing fluid flowing through both normal faults and permeable sediments (e.g., tectonic breccias and calcarenites). Although these assemblages do not display a stockwork geometry, they may be comparable from a mineralogical and geochemical perspective to feeder mineralization elsewhere (Goodfellow, 2004; Large et al., 1996; Large et al., 2005), where elevated concentrations of some metals and metalloids (Cu, Co, Ni, As, and Sb) are typically more abundant close to vent systems (Sangster, 2018; Torremans et al., 2018). The cherts and associated sulfides (Fig. 7) are interpreted as hydrothermal exhalites formed in an extensional regime because they occur close to, and increase in abundance, above the intersection of the G and S faults. Both the hydrothermal cherts and the higher temperature sulfide assemblage show a similar lateral distribution pattern controlled by the G and S faults.\nThe geometry of these structures and their relationships to the Navan Fault are compatible with the faulted basin-margin architecture proposed for SEDEX systems, with at least 2 to 5\u00a0km of syn-rift sediments, and where hydrothermal discharge to the seafloor was commonly focused at the intersection of extensional and transform faults (Lydon, 1995; Leach et al., 2005).\n\n\n8.5\nEvolution of mineralizing fluids\nAlthough no fluid inclusion data yet exist from the Tara Deep deposit, the temperature and salinity of the fluids at the nearby Navan deposit have been constrained by several studies (Braithwaite and Rizzi, 1997; Everett and Wilkinson, 2001; Peace et al., 2003). The wide range of salinities and temperatures are consistent with fluid mixing (Anderson et al., 1998; Wilkinson, 2010). A basement-equilibrated, relatively high-temperature, low-salinity, H2S-poor, metal-bearing fluid mixed with a cooler, high-salinity, connate brine considered to be associated with BSR (Ashton et al., 2015 and references therein). Given the similarities in mineralogy, \u03b434S values, gross geometry and timing, it is unlikely that the fluids generating the Tara Deep deposit were vastly different.\nHowever, the relative scarcity of base metals in the N-TBU (Fig. 5) may be due to the circulation of metal-exhausted, hydrothermal fluids, or to a fall-off in temperature and\/or salinity, and thus the Cl- activity, in the later stages of hydrothermal fluid circulation, thus precluding the effective transport of metals (Leach et al., 2005). Based on mineralogy, textures and S isotopes, the large amount of early, low \u03b434S, framboidal pyrite and pyritized fossils (Figs. 5 and 8) suggests that early hydrothermal fluids were acidic and H2S poor. In addition, the strongly negative \u03b434S values of most framboidal pyrite (mean\u00a0=\u00a0\u221224.0\u2030) and pyritized fossil (mean\u00a0=\u00a0\u221213.2\u2030) samples indicate that most of their contained S was ultimately BSR-derived.\nThe preservation of higher, almost all positive, \u03b434S values (up to 44\u2030; Fig. 8) is restricted to later sulfides linked to the hydrothermal cherts and replacive associations in both the mineralized SFC and N-TBU (Figs. 4, 6 and 7). In this scenario, a suitable source for such heavy S may be thermochemical sulphur reduction (TSR) of contemporaneous seawater (Magnall et al., 2016; Sangster, 2018). Moreover, extremely high S isotope ratios measured in both chalcopyrite and marcasite (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a036 and 44 \u2030, respectively) suggest periods of intense hydrothermal activity and high TSR rates. Alternatively, isotopically heavy S may have been derived by hydrothermal fluid leaching of pyrite from underlying Lower Palaeozoic rocks (Anderson et al., 1989). These pyrites have extremely variable S isotope compositions, including a substantial proportion with positive \u03b434S values and including maximum \u03b434S values of ~ +60\u2030 (Anderson et al., 1989; Boyce et al., 1994). Furthermore, textural links between cherts and high- \u03b434S chalcopyrite, galena, stibnite and siegenite (Fig. 7g-i) also suggest relatively hot fluids able to transport Si, Cu, Co, Sb, Bi (Fournier, 1985; Seward et al., 2014; Moroni et al., 2019). The presence of cherts with marcasite rims (Fig. 7a-f) also implies their crystallization from acidic fluids (Murowchick and Barnes, 1986; Hopkinson et al., 1999). This process would also explain the presence of minor late barite veins (Fig. 5l) because Ba is soluble in reduced and acidic solutions (Lydon, 1983; Cooke et al., 2000).\n\n\n8.6\nMetal deposition\nThe precipitation of sulfides from hydrothermal fluids is generally related to processes that influence the stability of metal complexes. The main mechanisms that cause destabilization of metal complexes and ore precipitation include fluid boiling (immiscibility), fluid mixing, decreases in temperature, pressure, and salinity, and fluid-rock interactions (Hemley et al., 1992; Zhai et al., 2011; Seo et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2016).\nUnder anoxic conditions, BSR is the most likely process to reduce seawater sulfate to H2S (Goodfellow and Jonasson, 1984; Large et al., 2005), which is then able to be fixed by reactive Fe2+ provided by the halide complexes of the hydrothermal fluid and precipitated as framboidal pyrite (Fig. 5a-c) (Goodfellow, 2000; Large et al., 2005). The wide range of low \u03b434S values preserved in framboidal pyrite (-38.8 to 3.3\u2030; Fig. 8) represent a large offset from the \u03b434S value of coeval seawater sulfate (i.e. up to 60\u2030; Kampschulte et al., 2001), suggesting a large isotopic fractionation in pore fluids under open-system conditions (i.e., sulphate resupply\u00a0>\u00a0sulfate consumption) (Kaplan and Rittenberg, 1964; Canfield and Thamdrup, 1994). Since H2S is produced by BSR within the first 2\u00a0m of the sediment column, even where overlain by oxic water, sulfide precipitation will always occur within the anoxic sediment regardless of the origin of the metal-bearing fluid (Goodfellow and Jonasson, 1984; Large et al., 2002; S\u00e1ez et al., 2011). By analogy, an effective metal trap in the N-TBU resulted from interactions between early diagenetic and hydrothermal processes. Metalliferous fluids further ascended into the subsurface anoxic environment, impregnating the organic-rich muds where pyrite and minor sphalerite were precipitated, leading to the formation of laminated pyrite facies (Fig. 5a-g) and pyritized fossils (Fig. 5h-k). Sulfide textures, mineral assemblages and trace element compositions similar to those described in both the laminated pyrite and pyritized fossils have also been described in Rammelsberg, Tharsis, McArthur River and Ab-Bagh deposits (S\u00e1ez et al., 2011; Large and McGoldrick, 1998; Movahednia et al., 2020).\nMetal precipitation related to the later higher-temperature assemblages in both the SFC and N-TBU may have been triggered by a decrease in fluid temperature by interaction with the cooler sedimentary and diagenetic environment. Both skeletal marcasite, common in the replacive assemblages (Fig. 6c) and chert crystallization temperatures (Fig. 9), suggest rapid cooling of acidic hydrothermal fluids (Chen et al., 2010; Heaney,1993; Hopkinson et al., 1999). Moreover, marcasite showing birds-eye texture as rims on cherts (Fig. 7f) indicates slight oxidation processes (Ramdohr, 1980). In this scenario, the cooling of the fluids reduces the solubility of metals (Brimhall and Crerar, 1987; Reed and Palandri, 2006), consequently resulting in the deposition of higher-temperature sulfide assemblages (Figs. 4i-j, 6f-h and 7g-l). The textural relationships between these higher temperature sulfide assemblages and the hosting sediments suggests that these formed by both replacement of the sediments during early diagenesis (e.g. sulfide veins crosscutting and deforming the bedding and infilling primary sediments porosity; Fig. 6), as well as on or near to the seafloor, recorded by the deposition of hydrothermal cherts coevally with sulfides (Fig. 7). Moreover, the precipitation of minor late barite veins (Fig. 5l) in the N-TBU reflects some minor sulfate activity in connate waters (Johnson et al., 2009). Some Ba carried by hydrothermal fluids might have reacted with the remaining, probably isotopically heavier, sulfate to precipitate barite in the latest stages.\n\n\n8.7\nLinks between sulfides hosted by Pale Beds, SFC and N-TBU\nOverall, SEDEX systems are typically long-lived (Goodfellow and Lydon, 2007). Hydrothermal activity commonly continues after sulfide formation, forming post-ore mineralized sediments and widespread alteration extending for hundreds of metres into the stratigraphic hanging-wall sequence and up to several kilometres laterally from the deposit (Lambert and Scott, 1973; Large et al., 2002; Mukherjee and Large, 2017).\nAt Tara Deep, mineralization hosted by the N-TBU clearly shows that mineralizing fluids continued circulating after the formation of the sulfides hosted by the Pale Beds. Sedimentation of overlying breccias and N-TBU was cyclic. Sulfide clasts included in the sedimentary breccias (Fig. 4a and f), coupled with alternating discrete laminated pyrite layers (Fig. 5a), suggests repeated erosion of mineralized Pale Beds, diagenetic sulfide formation in black shales, and re-mineralization overprinting both sulfide clast and laminated pyrite at times of fault movement (Fig. 2) with intervening, tectonically quiescent periods. Active faulting may have facilitated Pale Beds mineralization by allowing mixing of metal-bearing and sulfide-bearing fluids. Mineralization in both the SFC matrix and the N-TBU therefore represent post-ore hydrothermal activity of the Tara Deep Pale Beds-hosted deposit, with hydrothermal cherts the most distal part of the system.\nOverall, the mineralization in and above the SFC and BSB represents a hanging-wall halo to the Tara Deep Pale Beds-hosted Zn-Pb mineral deposit. Exhausted and\/or weaker brine exhalations were likely sourced from the G, and possibly S, faults and were probably relatively dilute compared to the mineralizing brines that deposited the Pale Beds-hosted mineralization. Most geological features included in the hanging-wall halo are similar to those described in Tom, Meggen, Sullivan and Howards Pass in the Yukon deposits (Hamilton et al., 1982; Goodfellow, 2004; Gwosdz and Krebs, 1977; Turner et al., 2000). These deposits include, in their outer margins, bedded hydrothermal products extending for up to several kilometers from the discharge zone. These distal facies include laminated pyrite, Mn enrichment, cherts, iron and calcium carbonates, iron oxides, barite and phosphates (Gwosdz and Krebs, 1977; Large, 1981; Hamilton et al., 1982; S\u00e1ez et al., 1999).\nA potentially important observation is that the Tara Deep halo contains multiple episodes of mineralization recorded by veining, infilling, and replacement of bedded sulfides by typically higher-temperature assemblages (Fig. 4i-j, 6f-h, 7\u00a0g-i). These late assemblages share identical mineralogy and texture in matrix cementing the SFC and N-TBU (compare Fig. 4i with Fig. 7i), and in their S isotope values (Fig. 8), which in turn, matches with the late mineral association in the Pale Beds-hosted mineralization (see Figs. 5 and 7 of Yesares et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\n\n9.1\nSummary of mineralizing events\nAssuming genetic models previously proposed for the Navan deposit, primary Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Pb sulfides hosted by the Pale Beds at Tara Deep formed by epigenetic replacement of carbonates where normal faults acted as pathways for ascending, relatively-warm, H2S-poor, metal-bearing fluids. These mineralizing fluids scavenged metal from the underlying Lower Palaeozoic basement and then mixed with a cooler, hypersaline brine carrying SO4.\nThe ongoing extensional tectonic activity in the area during the Lower Vis\u00e9an led to the erosion of parts of the early mineralized Pale Beds and the development of the SFC. The deposition of fault-talus sedimentary breccias which included reworked clasts of sulfide supports a Lower Vis\u00e9an minimum age for the onset of sulfide mineralisation in the micrites.\nMineralizing events in the Lower Vis\u00e9an record at Tara Deep can be summarized in two stages (Fig. 10\n):\n\nStage I - Sub-seafloor replacement by pyrite\n\nAcidic, H2S-deficient, metal-exhausted and\/or originally more dilute mineralizing fluids ascended to the SFC and N-TBU pile via the G Fault and possibly the S Fault. Fe-rich hydrothermal fluids circulated along the weakly oxic to anoxic diagenetic environment where metals were trapped in open spaces of the SFC, as well as organic material-bearing shales and calcarenites of the N-TBU. Fe and minor Zn were fixed by H2S produced by BSR, thereby precipitating a large amount of framboidal pyrite, together with associated sphalerite, and causing pyritization of fossils.\n\nStage II - Deposition of minor higher-temperature sulfide assemblages\n\nContinued flow of metal-bearing fluids led to Fe-sulfide recrystallization and the replacement of earlier laminated pyrite and pyritized fossils by later higher temperature sulfides. Evidence of soft-sediment deformation by both incoming stage II fluids (Fig. 6d) and by chert growth (Fig. 7a) suggests that there was no large time interval between stages I and II and that they possibly overlapped. Mineralogical, mineral chemistry and isotopic data for stage II sulfides indicate that the mineralizing fluids evolved to become more reduced, warmer and more acidic, perhaps due to deepening basement fluid circulation, enabling Cu, Co, Sb and Si transportation. The rapid cooling of metal-bearing fluids by interaction with the cooler sedimentary and diagenetic environment induced the precipitation of later sulfides in the matrix of the SFC, as well as replacive assemblages and hydrothermal cherts in the N-TBU. The lack of mineralization in higher stratigraphic levels implies that hydrothermal activity in the Tara Deep area ceased after deposition of hydrothermal chert at the top of the N-TBU.\nA high degree of preservation of the SEDEX halo (i.e., framboids) indicates that organic-rich black shales provided reducing conditions which precluded sulfide oxidation. Moreover, later continuing thick sedimentation during formation of the Fingal Group has favoured the preservation of the original mineralization.\n\n\n9.2\nImplications for exploration\nEconomic and potentially economic Pale Beds-hosted Zn-Pb mineralization in the Navan area is widespread, distributed from the Main Navan Orebody to Tara Deep. However, there are no known deposits further to the southeast of Tara Deep. There is no a priori reason for the paucity of deposits, as the geodynamic extensional setting and host rocks are particularly favorable for mineralization. Although this southeastern area has yet to be subject to exploration drilling, analogous, more deeply buried, mineralization may be present. Thus better understanding and definition of the sub-economic sulfide halos overlying the much higher grade Tara Deep deposit provides valuable information for exploration and may enhance mineral exploration strategies for deeply buried deposits.\nAccording to the results of the study, although hydrothermal products in both the N-TBU and SFC may extend a few kilometers, they are best developed close to normal faults and immediately above the underlying micrite-hosted mineralization, indicating pathways for ore-forming fluids and links between different mineralization styles.\nAt the deposit-scale, as discussed above, debris flows and sedimentary breccias are good evidence for syn-sedimentary faulting. Detailed studies on samples from a drill core at the southeast limit of Tara Deep indicate that there is more syn-sedimentary breccia in this area. Also, the presence of both laminated pyrite and minor high temperature sulfide assemblages in black shale samples in this area are a good indicator for possible presence of undiscovered deeper mineralization.\nThe apparent genetic linkage between sub-seafloor exhalative and underlying replacive mineralization in the Navan area may have geological and exploration implications for other sediment-hosted mineral provinces. Exhalative mineralization, including economic deposits, may represent halos of underlying replacive deposits, especially where carbonate footwall rocks are developed.\n\n\n","64":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nDue to the close association between basalts and hydrothermal activity, it is commonly considered that basaltic eruptions dominate hydrothermal circulation along sediment-starved oceanic ridges, which may extract ore-forming materials from wall rocks before their precipitation as sulfides on the seafloor (e.g., Large, 1992; Shanks, 2001; Hannington et al., 2005; Seal, 2006; Keith et al., 2016; Grant, et al., 2018). This results in most sulfide deposits being hosted in basalts, especially at fast-spreading ridges (Baker et al., 1996). The ultraslow-spreading ridges were considered to lack hydrothermal fields because of the scarce magmatic activity (Baker et al., 1996). However, further studies proved that axial sulfide deposits can develop in such ridges, such as Mt. Jourdanne in Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR; M\u00fcnch et al., 2001), Loki\u2019s Castle along Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR; Pedersen et al., 2010), and Piccard along Mid-Cayman Rise (Kinsey and German, 2013). At the ultraslow-spreading SWIR, the first observed active black-smoker chimney at Longqi (49.6\u00b0E; Tao et al., 2012), ended the controversy concerning whether sulfide deposits can develop in such ridges. Subsequently, several more hydrothermal fields have been discovered near the Longqi field, including the Yuhuang (49.3\u00b0E), Xilongjing (49.7\u00b0E), Duanqiao (50.4\u00b0E), Changbai (~51.0\u00b0E), and Zhanqiao (~51.0\u00b0E) fields (Tao et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2017b; Liao et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). A significant feature of ultraslow-spreading ridges is that they can be divided into magmatic and amagmatic segments based on their association with magmatism, as in the case of the SWIR (Sauter et al., 2009; Standish and Sims. 2010). The extensive occurrence of basalts in hydrothermal fields along these ultraslow-spreading ridges suggests a close association of these fields with magmatic activity as well.\nIn addition to axial hydrothermal systems associated with basaltic activities, the hydrothermal fields closely related to ultramafic rocks have been recognized as another type of hydrothermal system, which mainly developed along slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges (e.g., Hannington et al., 2005). The first sulfide ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal vent field, Logatchev, was discovered along the MAR (Krasnov et al., 1995). After that, other sulfide and non-sulfide ultramafic-hosted fields were identified along slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges, such as Rainbow (German et al., 1996), Lost City (Kelley et al., 2001), Ashadze (Beltenev et al., 2002), Menez Hom (Fouquet et al., 2002), Saldanha (Dias and Barriga, 2006), Semyenov (Beltenev et al., 2007), and Nibelungen (Melchert et al., 2008) along MAR, Von Damm from Mid-Cayman Rise (Connelly et al., 2012), Kairei from CIR (Wang, 2012), and Tianzuo from SWIR (Tao et al., 2014). Unlike their counterparts hosted in basalts, studies for ultramafic-hosted sulfide deposits are quite few, leading to the mineralization processes still unclear. Nevertheless, for on-land ultramafic-hosted sulfide deposits, if not clearly of magmatic origin, are thought to be linked to serpentinization processes involving the remobilization of metals from primary silicate minerals (e.g., olivine) into hydrothermal sulfides (if sufficient H2S is available) (e.g., Outokumpus of Finland, Ga\u00e1l and Parkkinen, 1993; Loukola-Ruskeeniemi, 1999, and Kidd Creek of Canada, Barrie et al., 1999).\nHowever, a growing number of studies have implied that even in hydrothermal fields hosted in tectonic-related hydrothermal systems, fluids may circulate through mafic basements. For example, the analysis of vent fluids in active seafloor hydrothermal systems has shown that concentrations of most elements (eg. Mn, Zn, Cu, Ag, Ba, Cd, Rb and As) are comparable in hydrothermal systems associated with ultramafic and basaltic rocks (Jean-Baptiste et al., 1991; Wetzel and Shock, 2000; Charlou et al., 1998, 2002; Douville et al., 2002; Schmidt et al., 2007). In addition, the MAR Logatchev-2 and Rainbow hydrothermal fields have a Cu\u2013Zn mineralization contrasting with the distinct Cu mineralization of the Logatchev-1 field, even though these fields are restricted to serpentinite protrusions, meaning that the primary ultramafic rocks did not control the metallogeny of ores associated with them (Lein et al., 2001). Moreover, Allen and Seyfried (2004) further proposed that even for the Lost City system, which was dominated by low-temperature carbonate precipitates, serpentinization likely played an insignificant role accounting for hydrothermal circulation compared with hot lithospheric units and\/or near magmatic heat sources, as the chemical compositions of vent fluids from this hydrothermal field are virtually unchanged from the seawater values. These mean that the sulfide mineralization mechanisms associated with ultramafic rocks are still obscure, an improved understanding of sulfide mineralization along oceanic ridges thus requires the elucidation of sulfide mineralization hosted in ultramafic rocks.\nThe recently discovered Tianzuo hydrothermal field (27\u00b057\u2032S, 63\u00b032E) in the easternmost ultraslow-spreading SWIR is an inactive sulfide hydrothermal field hosted in ultramafic rocks associated with detachment faults (Tao et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018). Based on the previously mineralogical observation (Cao et al. 2018), the sulfide assemblage was further studied in this research, and we found that the sulfide minerals from this field can be subdivided into high-temperature (isocubanite, sphalerite, and minor pyrrhotite) and low-temperature (pyrite I, marcasite, pyrite II, and covellite) assemblages. This means that these sulifde minerals can be the indicators showing the sources and evolution for the ore-forming hydrothermal fluids where they precipitated. Consequently, our study aimed to use major- and trace-element compositions of isocubanite and pyrite II from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field as indicators in explaining sulfide mineralization hosted by ultramafic rocks, and to improve our understanding of sulfide mineralization in the SWIR and other slow- and ultraslow-spreading oceanic ridges.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nGeology of SWIR\nThe SWIR separates the African and Antarctic plates, from the Bouvet Triple Junction (BTJ; 0 E) in the west to the Rodrigues Triple Junction (RTJ; 70\u00b0E) in the east (Fig. 1\na). This ridge extends for\u00a0~8000\u00a0km with an almost constant spreading rate of\u00a0~14\u00a0mm\u00a0yr\u22121 and it is one of the slowest-spreading ridges globally (Dick et al., 2003; Horner-Johnson et al., 2005). The ridge is characterized by very rugged submarine topography with an axial rift valley and water depths of\u00a0>5000\u00a0m. The SWIR is cut by a series of N\u2013S-striking transform faults that divide it into individual segments with distinct geological characteristics (Cannat et al., 1999). Bathymetric data reveal a shallow central region between the Prince Edward (35\u00b0E) and Gallieni (52\u00b020 E) fracture zones, with an average depth of\u00a0~3200\u00a0m (Fig. 1a; Sauter et al., 2001; Cannat et al., 2008). This bathymetric high land is correlated with negative residual mantle Bouguer gravity anomalies and was expressed as thick oceanic crust, indicating a robust magma supply since 10\u20138\u00a0Ma, probably associated with the Crozet and Marion hotspots (Sauter et al., 2004, 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhou and Dick, 2013; Yang et al., 2017a). This area also hosts most of the hydrothermal activities discovered to date. Unlike the region between the Prince Edward and Gallieni fracture zones, the easternmost SWIR region between the Melville Fracture Zone (61\u00b0E) and RTJ has no transform faults (Fig. 1b), with a smooth seafloor between two ridge flanks (Cannat et al., 2003; Sauter et al., 2013). This indicates an anomalously low average melt supply and strong tectonism. There has been no obvious magmatic activity for at least 26 Myr in this region (Cannat et al., 2006). Compared with other segments of the ridge, the easternmost SWIR has the greatest water depth (4730\u00a0m) and thinnest (or missing) crust, with these features being attributed to lower mantle temperatures and lower degrees of mantle melting (Minshull et al., 2006; Cannat et al., 2008). However, several segments with robust magma supply and high relief (e.g., at\u00a0~61.5\u00b0E, 64\u00b0E, and 65.5\u00b0E) exist along the easternmost SWIR (Fig. 1c), displaying volcanic structures several tens of meters high, with lateral extension for several tens of kilometers.\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the Tianzuo hydrothermal field\nThe Tianzuo hydrothermal field was discovered during the COMRA DY115-20 cruise of the R\/V Da Yang Yi Hao in 2009 (Tao et al., 2014), and lies in Segment 11 of the SWIR, near the inactive Mt Jourdanne and active Tiancheng fields (Fig. 2\na; M\u00fcnch et al., 2001; Nayak et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018). Further detailed investigations of this hydrothermal site were carried out by the Chinese manned submersible Jiaolong during the COMRA DY115-35 cruise of the R\/V Xiang Yang Hong 9 in 2014\u20132015. Segment 11 has an hourglass shape extending N\u2013S for\u00a0>20\u00a0km, with an axial volcanic ridge bounded to the east and west by a non-transform discontinuity (NTD; Fig. 2a). Along-axis topography in Segment 11 varies within\u00a0~2700\u00a0m, and crustal thickness is\u00a0>6\u00a0km at the center with high relief, with an average thickness of\u00a0~4\u00a0km. Maximum crustal thicknesses in adjacent low-relief segments are 2\u20133\u00a0km, indicating focused and variable magmatic accretion (Fig. 2b; Cannat et al., 1999, Cannat et al., 2003). Segment 11 may be dominated by strong melt-focusing processes, similar to other segments along the SWIR such as those between the Prince Edward and Gallieni fracture zones (Cannat et al., 1999; Sauter et al., 2001; Sato et al., 2013). The inactive Mt Jourdanne and adjacent active Tiancheng (with low-temperature diffuse flows) hydrothermal fields are located in a volcanic structure along the rift axis, at water depths of 2750 and 2950\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 2a and c). Outcrops in both of these fields comprise predominantly basaltic rocks (M\u00fcnch et al., 2001; Tao et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2018).\nThe Tianzuo hydrothermal field, located\u00a0~14\u00a0km southeast of the Tianzuo Seamount at a water depth of 3630\u00a0m, was the first confirmed ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal field at the SWIR. It is situated on top of a dome-shaped structure typically associated with oceanic detachment faults (Fig. 2d; Standish and Sims, 2010), and ultramafic outcrops, distinct from adjacent fields (Fig. 2a\u2013d). Hydrothermal activity is likely controlled by the detachment fault, as in the Logatchev and Rainbow fields (German et al., 1996; Schmidt et al., 2007). The DY115-20 cruise and 88th Jiaolong dive found that the main outcrops of the Tianzuo field are altered ultramafic rocks and hydrothermal precipitates with no significant evidence of magmatic activity or typical vent fauna (Fig. 3\n), indicating that hydrothermal activity is ancient. Adjacent areas near the Tianzuo hydrothermal field are covered by gray sediments (Fig. 3a and c), distinct from the Tianzuo field itself where red-brown sediments occur over an area of about 800\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7530\u00a0m (Fig. 3b and d). Strongly weathered opal and massive sulfides are exposed on the seafloor in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field (Fig. 3b and d). Samples analyzed in the present study were collected from the seafloor during the 88th Jiaolong dive and include mostly sulfides and serpentinized peridotites (Fig. 3e\u2013f). Representative samples of each type were collected by submersible Jiaolong when we travelled through this field westwards, including four fresh serpentinized ultramafic rocks collected from the marginal area of this field and three relative fresh sulfide samples collected from the sulfide mound (Fig. 3e\u2013f).\n\n\n2.3\nPetrography and mineralogy\n\n2.3.1\nMineralogy of serpentinized ultramafic rocks\nSerpentinized ultramafic rocks collected from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field generally contain large light-colored pyroxene phenocrysts surrounded by black serpentine minerals (Fig. 3e). Microscopic textures indicate that the samples contain abundant crystal relicts, including pyroxene, olivine, and minor spinel (Fig. 4\na\u2013d). Pyroxene is dominated by clinopyroxene, usually with altered rims and crosscut by magnetite and chrysotile veinlets (Fig. 4a\u2013b), indicating that the source rocks of serpentinized ultramafic rocks were most likely wehrlite. Pyroxene bastites also display jagged \u201ctears\u201d on the surface, indicating an extensional environment (Fig. 4b). Olivine is usually surrounded by a network of serpentine veinlets and cut by magnetite veinlets that display pseudomorphic mesh and hourglass textures after olivine (Fig. 4c and e). Spinel is usually surrounded or cut by serpentine minerals and replaced by magnetite (Fig. 4d). The lizardite and chrysotile can be identified in thin sections, generally replacing clinopyroxene, olivine, and spinel, and displaying pseudomorphic textures after these minerals (Fig. 4). In addition to the abundant magnetite veinlets that crosscut serpentine minerals (Fig. 4a, c), many subhedral to euhedral magnetite grains occur with a pseudomorphic texture after olivine (Fig. 4e\u2013h). Contemporaneous hematite is observed coexisting with subhedral to euhedral magnetite grains (Fig. 4f\u2013h), probably indicating a relatively oxidizing environment during serpentinization reactions. Minor quartz veinlets also occur within the serpentine minerals, possibly a product of serpentinization.\n\n\n2.3.2\nMineralogy and paragenesis of sulfides\nSulfides observed in the sulfide mound are mostly yellow-brown in color, since they are covered by red iron oxide as a result of weathering (Fig. 3f). Sulfide minerals, including major pyrite and isocubanite and minor pyrrhotite, sphalerite, and covellite, constitute\u00a0>70% of the ore, and are present as anhedral grains with rare subhedral to euhedral crystals disseminated in serpentine-bearing ultramafic rocks (Figs. 5\u20136\n\n). Serpentine and quartz constitute the other 30% of the ore, occurred as brown or red color with abundant holes, most likely resulting from strong weathering.\nPyrite is the most abundant sulfide phase and it is either hosted in serpentine minerals or coexists with quartz (Figs. 5 and 6; Cao et al., 2018). Based on its morphology, pyrite can be subdivided into two types, pyrite I and II. Pyrite I generally coexisted with marcasite occurring as colloform texture and pseudomorphically replace pyrrhotite plates (Figs. 5 and 6). Pyrite II generally occurred as the results of replacement for pyrite I with the retention of marcasite relicts (Fig. 6a), sometimes, pyrite I was absent because of the complete replacement, or due to the erosion of strong weathering, resulting abundant holes surrounded by pyrite II rims (Fig. 5a, c, f). Pyrite II crystals also typically grow around and replace early isocubanite and sphalerite, or occur as individual grains in quartz veinlets with no inclusions visible under microscopic examination (Figs. 5 and 6). Marcasite is unstable and can only precipitate at relatively low temperatures (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) and low pH (<4.5), undergoing transformation to pyrite at temperatures of\u00a0>350\u00a0\u00b0C (Fleet, 1970; Koski et al., 1984; Graham et al., 1988). This suggests that pyrite in Tianzuo hydrothermal field precipitated later and crystallized during a low-temperature phase; this is particularly the case for pyrite II, which also replaces pyrite I.\nIsocubanite disseminated in serpentine minerals is easy to be distinguished from other sulfide minerals in the Tianzuo field (Fig. 5). Isocubanite displays an anhedral shape and brown color, usually with grid structures typically resulting from exsolution from other Cu\u2013Fe sulfides such as chalcopyrite, with this being further indicated by its Cu-rich rims as illustrated in Fig. 5c. There are no obvious crosscutting relationships between isocubanite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite (or pyrite I with pseudomorphic texture after pyrrhotite), so precipitation of isocubanite was likely contemporaneous with crystallization of pyrrhotite and sphalerite (Fig. 5). Isocubanite displays obvious replacement by late pyrite II (Fig. 5b, d and 6c), so its precipitation must pre-date that of pyrite II. Experimental studies of phase relationships of reactions in Cu\u2013Fe\u2013S and Fe\u2013S systems indicate that at temperatures of\u00a0>335\u00a0\u00b0C, isocubanite begins to crystallize with chalcopyrite, pyrite, and pyrrhotite (Lusk and Bray, 2002). Isocubanite was thus likely precipitated during the high-temperature phase of the Tianzuo hydrothermal system.\nPyrrhotite is rare in Tianzuo sulfide samples; it is usually included in pyrite II with an anhedral shape and as a relict replaced by late pyrite II (Fig. 5f). This indicates that the sulfide ores in Tianzuo field were originally enriched in pyrrhotite, which was almost completely replaced by pyrite, resulting in few pyrrhotite relicts in pyrite II (Fig. 5f), and abundant pseudomorphic textures (Fig. 6b and e).\nSphalerite is also rare in sulfides collected from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field. It is generally anhedral, gray in color, and contains abundant isocubanite or, conversely, is included in isocubanite as exsolution lamellae (Fig. 5d\u2013e), indicating that the precipitation of sphalerite was contemporaneous with that of isocubanite during early high-temperature mineralization.\nCovellite is blue in color and usually replaces sphalerite with an anhedral morphology (Fig. 5d\u2013e), or occurs in quartz veinlets as lamellae or fibrous aggregates (Fig. 6f). An atomic Cu:S ratio of 1:1 was obtained by EMPA (Cao et al., 2018). Covellite is a low-temperature sulfide phase generally found in massive sulfide samples (Lusk and Bray, 2002). Both pyrite II and covellite occur in quartz veinlets, probably indicating their contemporaneous precipitation during late-stage low-temperature mineralization.\nOn the basis of these observations, we conclude that sulfide mineralization in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field occurred in two stages: an early high-temperature stage (>335\u00a0\u00b0C; including isocubanite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite), and a late low-temperature stage (<200\u00a0\u00b0C; including pyrite, marcasite, and covellite), as illustrated in Fig. 7\n.\n\n\n\n\n3\nAnalytical methods\n\n3.1\nPreliminary mineralogy and SEM analyses\nSerpentinized ultramafic rocks and massive sulfide samples from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field were prepared as thin-sections for analysis. Mineralogy and textural\u2013structural relationships were investigated under transmitted and reflected light with a petrographic microscope. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was conducted by using a Zeiss Supra 55 instrument at the State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, with an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV.\n\n\n3.2\n\nIn situ LA-ICP-MS analysis\nBased on the paragenetic sequence and morphology of sulfides, pure isocubanite (62 grains) and pyrite II (40 grains) without visible surface mineral inclusions were selected for in situ laser-ablation\u2013inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry (LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS) determination of trace-element compositions. There were insufficient quantities of other sulfide minerals such as pyrrhotite, sphalerite, pyrite I, and covellite for such analyses. A Teledyne Cetac Technologies Analyte Excite laser-ablation system (Bozeman, Montana, USA) coupled to an Agilent Technologies 7700x ICP\u2013MS instrument (Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan) was used, at Nanjing FocuMS Technology, Nanjing, China. The operating conditions and methods of data reduction used are described by Xie et al. (2008), Hou et al. (2009), and Gao et al. (2013). In brief, the 193\u00a0nm ArF excimer laser, homogenized by a set of beam delivery systems, was focused on sulfide surface with fluence of 6.06\u00a0J\/cm2. A 15\u00a0s gas background was collected prior to each ablation. Experimental Ablation protocol employed a spot diameter of 40\u00a0\u00b5m at 5\u00a0Hz repetition rate for 40\u00a0s (equating to 240 pulses). Helium carrier gas efficiently transport aerosol, and mixed with the Argon via a T-connector before entering the ICP-MS. USGS polymetal sulfide pressed pellet MASS-1 and synthetic basaltic glasses GSE-1G were combined calibration for sulfides (Gao et al., 2013). The standards were analyzed after every 10 spots to correct for instrument drift and mass discrimination. Raw data reduction were performed off-line by ICPMSDataCal software using 100%-normalization strategy without applying internal standard (Liu et al, 2008). Precision and accuracy were better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010%.\nCare was taken during LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS analyses to choose analytical points free of surface inclusions, but the depth of penetration of the laser beam made their complete avoidance difficult, with small inclusions likely to be present within the volume of samples in some cases. The significance of this can be ascertained through inspection of time-resolved LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS depth profiles displayed as time\u2013intensity scatterplots, which may be ragged, flat, or flat with occasional spikes, respectively indicating mineral inclusions, solid solutions or both.\n\n\n3.3\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) of in situ datasets\nIn order to further understand the behaviors of trace elements within isocubanite and pyrite II, we processed log-transformed raw datasets of trace-element concentrations by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) module included in Matlab 7.11 software. All elements obtained by in situ LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS were selected and very few raw data below the detection limit were replaced by fixed value 0.01 which is close to the detection limitation of the analytical method (Van den Boogaart and Tolosana-Delgado, 2013; Yuan et al., 2018). The results of PCA applied to the datasets are shown as (1) loadings table with the eigenvector coefficients of the principal components; (2) histogram of the eigenvalues of principal components and their explained variability; (3) scatterplot showing the element distributions with higher correlation, and (4) bivariate graph illustrating the analyzed-spot distributions between the first two principal components.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nTrace elements in sulfides\nThe trace-element contents of isocubanite and pyrite II from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field are presented in Supplementary Table 1, and summarized in Table 1\n. Isocubanite and pyrite II show distinct metal-distribution patterns in their time-resolved depth profiles, with the most concentrated metals having relatively flat profiles (Fig. 8\na). It is clear that these sulfide phases are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), such as Si, Mg, Al, Na, and K (Fig. 8a\u2013c), with these elements exhibiting flat or spiked depth profiles indicating that they exist as uniformly distributed nanoparticles or silicate inclusions (Fig. 8a\u2013c). However, metals such as Zn, Cu, Pb, Se, Sn, In, Co, and Mn display spiked depth profiles, indicating their occurrence as mineral inclusions (Fig. 8d\u2013f). The depth profiles of some elements change simultaneously, such as for Cu, Pb, and Zn (Fig. 8d), Co, Cu, and Zn (Fig. 8e), Se, Sn, Pb, and In (Fig. 8e), and Co, Mn, and Cu (Fig. 8f), indicating that these elements probably have similar distributions in the sulfides. Trace elements can thus be divided into three groups according to their most likely form of occurrence in sulfide phases: Group 1 includes elements (e.g., Si, Mg, Al, Na, K, Ca, Rb, Sr, Ba, and W) that most likely occur as silicates or fluid inclusions in isocubanite and pyrite II; Group 2 includes elements that can substitute for major elements in isocubanite and pyrite II such as Fe and\/or Cu (e.g., Pb, Zn, Co, Bi, Cd, Ag, In, Ni, Mn, and Sn) or S (e.g., Se and Te); and Group 3 includes elements that are closely associated with As and\/or Sb (e.g., Au, Mo, V, Cr, Ga, Ge, Ti, and Tl). Each of these groups is discussed in detail below. In general, the isocubanite has similar concentrations for Group 1 and 3 elements compared with pyrite II, only except that Mo and Tl are enriched in the latter. On the contrary, all the Group 2 elements are more enriched in isocubanite than pyrite II.\n\n4.1.1\nGroup 1 elements\nBoth isocubanite and pyrite II from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field are enriched in LILEs, including Si (343\u2013291,128\u00a0ppm), Mg (17\u2013224,193\u00a0ppm), Al (<detection limit (<DL)\u2013661\u00a0ppm), Na (2.25\u20137432\u00a0ppm), K (2.28\u20139169\u00a0ppm), Ca (<DL\u20132548\u00a0ppm), Rb (0.01\u201333.3\u00a0ppm), Sr (<DL\u201354.4\u00a0ppm), Ba (<DL\u201313.7\u00a0ppm), and W (<DL\u20132.75\u00a0ppm) (Table 1). These elements generally have much larger ionic radii compared with the major elements of isocubanite and pyrite (Fe, Cu, and S; Shannon, 1976), so they cannot incorporate the sulfide lattice by substitution. Their contents are also positively correlated with that of Si (Supplementary Fig. 1), and their time-resolved depth profiles change simultaneously. Therefore, it is likely that silicates occurred uniformly or as inclusions within sulfides (Fig. 8a\u2013c). Magnesium is abundant in isocubanite (mean 45,640\u00a0ppm) and pyrite II (mean 26,575\u00a0ppm) and its content is positively correlated with that of Si (Supplementary Fig. 1a), indicating that serpentine is most likely one of the silicate inclusions in the sulfides. Aluminum is positively correlated with Si (Supplementary Fig. 1b), with a profile changing simultaneously with those of Si, Mg, Na, K, and Ca (Fig. 8a\u2013e). The Al contents are low in both isocubanite (mean 33.2\u00a0ppm) and pyrite II (23.6\u00a0ppm), indicating the likely occurrence of Mg-bearing (e.g., pyroxene) or Na-, K-, and Ca-bearing Al silicate (e.g., feldspar) inclusions in the sulfides. Although pyrite II has higher Na, K, and Ca contents (means 1279, 1422, and 467\u00a0ppm, respectively) than those of isocubanite (812, 472, and 312\u00a0ppm, respectively), both sets are much higher than the Al contents of these sulfides, indicating that these elements occur not only as silicate inclusions (e.g., pyroxene or feldspar) but probably also as fluid inclusions of high salinity.\n\n\n4.1.2\nGroup 2 elements\nGroup 2 includes mainly the chalcophile and siderophile elements that are preferentially precipitated as sulfides, and minerals (mainly Se- and Te-bearing) similar to sulfides within both isocubanite and pyrite II. The element concentrations in isocubanite as: S (144,207\u2013434,984\u00a0ppm), Fe (227,092\u2013434,082\u00a0ppm), Se (13.2\u2013540\u00a0ppm), Te (0.89\u201386.2\u00a0ppm), Cu (75,753\u2013227,788\u00a0ppm) , Zn (3116\u201315,236\u00a0ppm), Pb (1.23\u201384.5\u00a0ppm), Co (671\u20132078\u00a0ppm), Bi (0.05\u20133.65\u00a0ppm), Cd (4.12\u201388.7\u00a0ppm), Ag (0.87\u20133.84\u00a0ppm), In (0.95\u201321.6\u00a0ppm), Ni (0.70\u2013238\u00a0ppm), Mn (693\u20132266\u00a0ppm), and Sn (5.42\u201311.3\u00a0ppm); whereas in pyrite II as: S (186,563\u2013474,254\u00a0ppm), Fe (324,092\u2013556,358\u00a0ppm), Se (<DL\u201369.9\u00a0ppm), Te (0.02\u20134.01\u00a0ppm), Cu (107\u201326,411\u00a0ppm), Zn (25.5\u20133996\u00a0ppm), Pb (0.03\u201317.9\u00a0ppm), Co (21.7\u20132043\u00a0ppm), Bi (0.01\u20130.64\u00a0ppm), Cd (0.07\u20133.73\u00a0ppm), Ag (0.01\u20133.28\u00a0ppm), In (0.01\u20130.80\u00a0ppm), Ni (0.36\u201331.4\u00a0ppm), Mn (146\u20133702\u00a0ppm), and Sn (<DL\u20132.73\u00a0ppm) (Table 1).\nThe Se contents are positively correlated with Te, indicating that they behave similarly to S when incorporated into sulfides (Fig. 9\na). The Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Bi, Cd, Ag, In, Ni, Mn and Sn contents are positively correlated with Se content (Figs. 9 and 10\n and Supplementary Fig. 2), which is especially true for isocubanite, suggesting that they are also positively correlated with S contents, with these elements existing most likely as S-dominated minerals in sulfides. The depth profiles of Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Mn, Sn, Se, and In change simultaneously (Fig. 8d\u2013f), further suggesting similar behaviors when substituting into sulfides. Among these Group 2 elements, some element pairs can be further distinguished based on the significantly positive correlations between their contents, suggesting the exactly similar behaviors for these elements when substituting into the sulfide lattices, such as Se\u2013Te (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.85), Cu\u2013Zn (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.86), Zn\u2013Cd (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.61), and Sn\u2013In (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.78) (Figs. 9 and 10).\nThe Zn contents of all analyzed isocubanite grains from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field exceed 2000\u00a0ppm, with some pyrite II grains also having Zn contents >2000\u00a0ppm (although most are lower). In addition, the Zn depth profile changes simultaneously with that of Cu in both pyrite II and isocubanite (Fig. 8d\u2013e), suggesting that Zn substituted into isocubanite together with Cu. The high and variable Zn contents of pyrite II most likely reflect the occurrence of isocubanite inclusions in this sulfide (Fig. 8d). The Cd contents are positively correlated both with Se and Zn contents (Fig. 9f and Fig. 10b), indicating that these two elements may be incorporated similarly into sulfides (in particular, sphalerite) (e.g., Cook et al., 2009; Belissont et al., 2014).\nThe roughly positive relationship between Co and Ni contents in pyrite II indicates that these elements substitute in pyrite by similar ways. The Ni contents have an obviously negative relationship with Co contents in isocubanite, and this most likely results from substitution of Co for Ni when the contents of Co are elevated (Fig. 10c). The Mn contents are positively correlated with Co contents in both isocubanite and pyrite II (Fig. 10d), and depth profiles of Co and Mn change simultaneously in pyrite II (Fig. 8f), suggesting that these elements behave similarly when substituting into sulfides.\nThe depth profiles of Pb and Zn change simultaneously (Fig. 8d), suggesting that these Pb and Zn behave similarly when substituting into sulfides (Fig. 10e). No Pb-bearing sulfides are observed in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field, the positive relationships between Pb, Bi, and Ag contents suggest that Bi and Ag most likely exist in Bi-rich and argentiferous galena inclusions (Fig. 10f and Supplementary Fig. 2f).\nRoquesite (CuInS2) is isostructural with chalcopyrite (Wittmann, 1974), and Sn can substitute for Fe in stannite (Cu2FeSnS4), which has a similar crystal structure to that of chalcopyrite (Wuensch, 1976). Indium and Sn therefore may also be incorporated into isocubanite and pyrite II by substituting for Fe as they are positively correlated in both sulfides (with a trend sub-parallel to the In\/Sn\u00a0=\u00a01 line; Fig. 10g).\nThe Ag contents have no obvious correlation with Au in either isocubanite or pyrite II (Supplementary Fig. 2a), indicating that they do not exist as electrum (AgAu) in sulfides. Nor is Ag correlated with Sb (Supplementary Fig. 2h), suggesting a lack of inclusions enriched in both Ag and Sb, such as argentiferous tetrahedrite ((Cu, Fe)12Sb4S13). Silver is positively correlated with Te, Zn, and Pb (Supplementary Fig. 2b, d, f), indicating that Ag probably occurs in sulfides in forms similar to those of other chalcophile elements, such as argentite (Ag2S). The relative higher Se and Te contents of isocubanite than pyrite II indicate the possible occurrence of naumannite (Ag2Se; Fig. 9g) and hessite (Ag2Te; Supplementary Fig. 2b) in the former.\n\n\n4.1.3\nGroup 3 elements\nGroup 3 elements include Au (<DL\u20134.06\u00a0ppm), As (<DL\u2013167\u00a0ppm), Sb (<DL\u20135.01\u00a0ppm), Mo (0.05\u201337.7\u00a0ppm), V (<DL\u20138.38\u00a0ppm), Cr (<DL\u2013157\u00a0ppm), Ga (<DL\u20133.42\u00a0ppm), Ge (6.98\u201318.1\u00a0ppm), Ti (<DL\u201340.6\u00a0ppm), and Tl (<DL\u20131.61\u00a0ppm) (Table 1). These elements display no positive correlations with S, Se, or Te in both isocubanite and pyrite II (Fig. 10\nh), meaning that they are not incorporated into sulfides as S-, Se-, or Te-bearing minerals. However, they do have roughly positive relationships with As and Sb (Supplementary Fig. 2e, g and Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that As- and\/or Sb-bearing minerals most likely account for most of these elements in both isocubanite and pyrite II.\nThe Au contents are positively correlated with As and Sb contents (Supplementary Fig. 2e, g), and, as As has negative and positive relationships with Se and Sb, respectively (Fig. 10\nh and Supplementary Fig. 3a), Au might occur in sulfides in As- or Sb-bearing minerals such as aurostibite (AuSb2). Arsenic is the most common nonstoichiometric substitution in pyrite lattice, with values of up to 8\u00a0wt% (Fleet et al., 1989). Cook and Chryssoulis (1990) proposed a model for [Metal]\n3+(AsS)3\u2212 substitution for Fe2+(S2)2\u2212 in sulfides, with As substitution in the pyrite lattice occurring when (AsS)3\u2212 anions substitute for (S2)2\u2212 anions, as indicated by the negative relationship between As and Se (Fig. 10\nh). This substitution forms a lattice site that trivalent metal ions such as Fe3+ and Au3+ may occupy. Regarding Sb, although tetrahedrite can account for most Sb in sulfides, Sb is also positively correlated with As (Supplementary Fig. 3a), so may behave similarly to As in the sulfides as well.\nOther Group 3 elements include Mo, V, Cr, Ga, Ge, Ti, and Tl, the extremely low concentrations for these elements make the correlations with element As weak. No Mo-bearing minerals were observed optically in sulfides from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field, and Mo shows no correlation with S, so it does not seem to occur in sulfides as Mo-bearing mineral inclusions such as molybdenite. Under reducing conditions, molybdenum occurs as Mo3+ and could be accommodated in the structure of pyrite according to the model of Cook and Chryssoulis (1990), similar to Au3+ as mentioned above, as evidenced by the roughly positive relationship between Mo and As (Supplementary Fig. 3b).\nAlthough Ga can substitute Fe and form gallite inclusions (CuGaS2), this element displays no positive correlation with Cu or S, so gallite inclusions are not expected in sulfides; rather, Ga contents have a roughly positive relationship with As and Sb contents (Supplementary Fig. 3c), which means that Ga in sulfides from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field is associated with As or Sb.\nQuadrivalent Ge4+ can substitute into sulfide coupled with divalent metals, such as this element can substitute 3Zn2+ by coupled with Cu2+ in sphalerite (Belissont et al., 2014). However, this element shows no positive correlation with Cu; instead, Ge contents have a roughly positive relationship with As and Sb contents (Supplementary Fig. 3d), this is interpreted as that Ge most likely in sulfides from this hydrothermal field is related with As or Sb, as it has the similar behaviors to the element Ga, with the possible substitution mechanism as follow:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n2Ga\n\n\n3\n+\n\n\n=\n\n\nGe\n\n\n4\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\nGe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough V-, Cr-, Ti-, and Tl-bearing sulfide minerals have not been observed in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field, and although the mechanisms of substitution of these elements in sulfides are unclear, they display roughly positive relationships with As (Supplementary Fig. 3e\u2013h). This suggests that these elements were also most likely substituted into the sulfide lattice as trivalent ions (V3+, Cr3+, Ti3+, and Tl3+), consistent with [Metal]3+ in the model proposed by Cook and Chryssoulis (1990).\n\n\n\n4.2\nPrincipal component analysis\nThe results of the PCA applied to the datasets are shown in Fig. 11\n, including loadings (Fig. 11a), explained variance (Fig. 11b), element distributions (Fig. 11c), and analyzed-spot distributions (Fig. 11d). Elements and spot analyses are projected on the PC1\u2013PC2 plane and account for 63.1% of element-content variance. Element distributions highlight four main groups or element correlation clusters (Fig. 11c), termed groups A, B, C, and D. Group A comprises Cu and the trace elements Te, Se, In, Cd, Ag, Co, Zn, Sn, Pb, Bi, Mn, and Ni (loading on PC1). These elements are incorporated into sulfides by substitution of S and Fe, and are generally enriched in isocubanite than pyrite II. Group B comprises Mg and other LILEs including Si, Al, Sr, K, Rb, Na, Ca, Ba, and W (loading on PC2), which resulted from the contamination of silicates in the process of analyses, and are generally enriched in both isocubanite and pyrite II. Group C comprises As, Sb, Mo, Au, Cr, Ti, V, Ga, Tl and Ge, with this group occupying an intermediate position between group A along PC1 and group B along PC2, and with these elements occurring as arsenides or stibnides in sulfides. The Groups A, B, and C illustrated by the PCA have significantly highlighted the strong correlation between the Groups 2, 1, and 3 elements as described in the section above. Group D comprises Fe and S, which exhibit a relatively well-marked negative correlation with both PC1 and PC2, most likely because Fe and S are the major elements in the lattices of both isocubanite and pyrite and are commonly substituted by other elements with similar behaviors in sulfides (Fig. 11c). The pattern of individual spot analyses of the different elements on the PC1\u2013PC2 plane illustrated in Fig. 11d corresponds to different types of sulfides: isocubanite is positively correlated to PC1 (group A elements), whereas pyrite II is against PC1. Both of isocubanite and pyrite II are correlated to PC2 (loaded by group B elements).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nHeat sources for high- and low-temperature sulfide mineralization hosted in ultramafic rocks\nNumerous studies attempt to explain the composition and physicochemical conditions of ore-forming fluids based on the sulfide minerals compositions. This is especially ture for the modern seafloor hydrothermal fluids associated sulfide deposits, which rarely experience late recrystallization and metamorphism that can significantly modify the primary trace element distributions (e.g., Halbach et al., 1998; Butler and Nesbitt, 1999; Houghton et al., 2004; Li et al., 2012; Melekestseva et al., 2014; Melekestseva et al., 2017; Wohlgemuth-Ueberwasser et al., 2015; Keith et al., 2016; Dekov et al., 2018; Grant, et al., 2018). Trace-element compositions in the sulfide phases can be controlled by several conditions of the hydrothermal systems, such as temperature, pH, redox conditions, and composition of the hosted rocks (e.g., Huston et al., 1995; Grant, et al., 2018). Moreover, the intervention of other processes occurring during the hydrothermal circulation, for example, the phase separation of the fluids or the direct contribution of magmatic sources may also contribute directly for the compositions of sulfides (e.g., Herzig et al., 1998). In sulfide phases, trace elements may occur in the chemical structure solid solutions, submicroscopic mineral inclusions, or by adsorption onto sulfide surfaces (e.g., Cook, 1996; Cook et al., 2009). Several factors may control the partition coefficient of trace elements between sulfides and hydrothermal fluids, including the size of the cation site in which substitution may occur, the charge-balance mechanism that allows the trace element to enter the sulfide lattice, and the nature of the trace element in the hydrothermal fluids (Goldschmidt\u2019s First Rule; Ghaderi et al., 1999; Ding et al., 2018a; Ding et al. (2018b)). Since isocubanite and pyrite have similar formulas as CuFe2S3 and FeS2, respectively, this means that except for those directly substitute for Cu in the isocubanite, the other elements most likely enter these two sulfide minerals in similar ways by substituting S and Fe, sites available for trace-element substitution in these two sulfides are therefore most likely similar, and thus trace-element contents of isocubanite and pyrite are predominantly controlled by the composition and physicochemical condition of ore-bearing hydrothermal fluids rather than by the differences between their crystal features.\nSerpentinization of ultramafic rocks was one of the heat sources driving hydrothermal circulation in sulfide and non-sulfide hydrothermal fields, however, heat-balance models predict that a wide range of hydrothermal venting temperatures may result from serpentinization reactions of peridotite, but temperatures of the hydrothermal fluids triggered by this process are only 40\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C (Lowell and Rona, 2002). The occurrence of pyrrhotite and isocubanite during early-stage sulfide mineralization in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field suggests that the temperature of hydrothermal fluids could be as high as 335\u00a0\u00b0C (Lusk and Bray, 2002), much higher than those developed through serpentinization reactions of peridotites. Unlike the other SWIR hydrothermal fields, there has been very little eruption of basalt in the ridge segment where the Tianzuo hydrothermal field is located (Fig. 2a). It is therefore likely that gabbroic intrusions occur beneath this field, with these providing additional heat. In fact, the occurrence of oceanic core complexes means that at least part of the oceanic lithosphere formed at slow- and ultraslow-spreading centers comprises peridotite with gabbroic intrusions in varying proportions (Cannat, 1996; Ranero and Reston, 1999; Lowell and Rona, 2002; Ildefonse et al., 2007). This suggest that gabbroic intrusions might provide additional heat necessary for mineralization in the Tianzuo hydrothermal field. High rates of serpentinization, episodically triggered by tectonic activity or fracture propagation, may produce hydrothermal fluids with temperatures of up to\u00a0~300\u00a0\u00b0C (Wetzel and Shock, 2000), but such fluids produced by serpentinization of different volumes of fresh lithosphere must have similar metal compositions derived from homogeneous initial rocks (e.g., ultramafic rocks and serpentinite). However, isocubanite and pyrite II of the Tianzuo hydrothermal field have distinct Te\/Se, Cu\/Zn, Co\/Ni, Co\/Mn, and In\/Sn ratios (Fig. 10a and 11a, c\u2013d, g), and the more elevated Te, Cu, Co, and In in isocubanite (compared with Se, Zn, Ni, Mn, and Sn) most likely derived from the gabbroic intrusions. Combination, we consider that the heat sources for the high- and low-temperature sulfide mineralization within Tianzuo field might be different, with the intrusion of gabbro dominated the heat source for the high-temperature stage, including isocubanite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite; while the serpentinization of ultramafic rocks by the reaction with seawater might be the heat source for the low-temperature sulfide mineralization, including pyrite I, II, and covellite.\n\n\n5.2\nPossible sources of metals and ore-forming fluids for high- and low-temperature sulfide mineralization\nCompared with other seafloor hydrothermal sulfide deposits along sediment-starved oceanic ridges, including the TAG and Logatchev deposits of the MAR, the Meso Zone and Kairei deposits of the CIR, and the Longqi deposit of the SWIR (Keith et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018), both isocubanite and pyrite II in the Tianzuo field (especially isocubanite) are generally enriched in the trace elements Se, Te, Zn, Co, Ni, and Mn, and depleted in Pb, Bi, Ag, Au, Sb, and As (Figs. 9 and 10 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Variations in concentrations of these elements in the studied sulfide minerals indicate that hydrothermal fluids where sulfides were precipitated were either enriched or depleted in these elements compared with those in other oceanic ridges. Three end-members may have contributed to the compositions of hydrothermal fluids where sulfides were precipitated within ultramafic rocks: ultramafic rocks from which elements were leached during serpentinization; seawater; and gabbroic intrusions (Herzig et al., 1998; Wetzel and Shock, 2000; Douville et al., 2002; Charlou et al., 2002; Seal, 2006). Although isocubanite and pyrite II have distinct elemental contents, most of the above elements have positive correlations or roughly positive relationships within these two sulfides, except for Ge, Au, Ni, Mo, and Tl (Figs. 9 and 10 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Their distinct compositions but positive relationships indicate that isocubanite and pyrite II are likely to have similar sources of ore-forming metals such as Pb, Zn, Bi, Cd, Ag and Sn.\nPyrite II is substantially more enriched in Mo and Tl than isocubanite, these elements generally occur as arsenides or stibnides in sulfides, and are generally enriched as in seawater rather than hydrothermal fluids (Douville et al., 2002; Schmidt et al., 2007), indicating that hydrothermal fluids where pyrite II precipitated were significantly affected by low-temperature seawater. In contrast, isocubanite precipitated in high-temperature environments and has higher Te\/Se, Cu\/Zn, Co\/Ni, Co\/Mn, and In\/Sn ratios than those of pyrite II, these distinct ratios cannot be fully controlled by temperature, as isocubanite is most likely enriched of all the elements Co, Se, Bi, Cu, Ni, and Sn under high temperature (e.g., Grant, et al., 2018). Sources of isocubanite-precipitating hydrothermal fluids thus have relative higher Te, Cu, Co, and In contents (compared with Se, Zn, Ni, Mn, and Sn) than those where pyrite II precipitated, which were likely contributed by injection of basaltic magmas beneath the Tianzuo hydrothermal field. Previous studies have shown that in addition to basalts, peridotites form a significant portion of the upper oceanic crust in slow- and ultraslow-spreading environments, with basaltic lavas occurring only as a thin veneer and with basaltic magmas locally being injected into peridotites (Dick, 1989; Cannat, 1993; Cannat, 1996; Dick et al., 2003; Standish and Sims, 2010; Zhou and Dick, 2013). In the Tianzuo hydrothermal field, intrusion of gabbroic magma may also break the crust and increase the volume of fresh lithosphere accessible to serpentinization (Lowell and Rona, 2002; Ildefonse et al., 2007), enhancing the serpentinization reactions and extraction of majority metals from ultramafic rocks, with isocubanite precipitated during this stage being more enriched in most metals than late-stage pyrite II. Gabbroic intrusions may thus have provided additional fluids and metals for hydrothermal fluids where isocubanite precipitated, whereas pyrite II precipitation was dominated by the relative weak serpentinization reaction between ultramafic rocks and seawater.\nIf hydrothermal fluids where isocubanite and pyrite II precipitated were influenced by different sources, distributions of distinct endmembers should be significantly discriminated by PCA (Belissont et al., 2014, and references therein; Yuan, et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2019). We processed log-transformed raw datasets of trace-element contents by PCA to distinguish metal sources for isocubanite and pyrite II (Fig. 11). The first discrimination factor, PC1, was loaded with Cu, Te, In, and other trace elements with similar behaviors including Cd, Se, Sn, Zn, Co, Ag, Bi, Pb, Mn, and Ni; and the second factor, PC2, was loaded with Mg, Al, Si, and other LILEs including Sr, K, Rb, Na, Ca, Ba, and W (Fig. 11c). The PC1\u2013PC2 plot indicates that isocubanite and pyrite II are dominated by PC1 and against PC1, respectively, both of these sulfides are significantly influenced by PC2 (Fig. 11d). This means that hydrothermal fluids where isocubanite precipitated were enriched in Cu, Te, In, and similar metals, with these elements generally being incorporated into isocubanite by substitution or through mineral inclusions. Their high concentrations indicate intense serpentinization with additional magmatically derived hydrothermal fluids as proposed above. Pyrite II is depleted in the elements loading on PC1, and enriched in Mo and Tl, indicating precipitation from hydrothermal fluids controlled predominantly by seawater convection rather than the influences of magmatic fluids. Fig. 11d thus illustrates the difference between additional metal sources: magmatic (PC1: right side) and lack of magmatic (against PC1: left side). However, the concentrations of LILEs in isocubanite and pyrite II are both significantly influenced by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks (PC2: top side), which are resulted from the contamination of silicates during the process of analyses as mentioned before.\n\n\n5.3\nRole of serpentinization in sulfide mineralization hosted in ultramafic rocks\nThe compositions of hydrothermal fluids are determined by their ability to extract metals, which is dominated by physicochemical conditions such as temperature, pH, the ligands involved, and redox conditions (Von Damm, 1990; Seyfried and Ding, 1993; Seyfried and Ding, 1995; Pokrovski et al., 2008; Hannington, 2014). Previous studies have indicated that hydrothermal fluids in ultramafic systems are generally of high temperature and low pH, with metals (particularly transition metals) being transported by chloro complexes under reducing conditions (Janecky and Seyfried, 1984; Seyfried and Ding, 1993; Seyfried and Ding, 1995; Douville, 1999; Douville et al., 2002; Keith et al., 2016). Such reactions, often involve serpentinization of olivine and orthopyroxene, releasing substantial quantities of H+. For example, the alteration of orthopyroxene enstatite (enst.) to serpentine (serp.), conserving Si, can be expressed as:\n\n(2)\n\n\n2\nM\ng\nS\ni\n\nO\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nenst\n.\n\n\n\n\n+\nM\n\ng\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n3\n\nH\n2\n\nO\n=\nM\n\ng\n3\n\nS\n\ni\n2\n\n\nO\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOH\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nserp\n.\n\n\n\n\n+\n2\n\nH\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe H+ released by such reactions may lead to an increase in Fe and other transition metal concentrations in hydrothermal fluids by promoting magnetite dissolution (Janecky and Seyfried, 1984; Jean-Baptiste et al., 1991; Wetzel and Shock, 2000; Charlou et al., 1998, 2002; Douville et al., 2002; Schmidt et al., 2007). The high temperatures of hydrothermal fluids resulting from the intrusion of gabbroic magma may enhance serpentinization by providing abundant magmatic fluids and volatiles to the hydrothermal systems (Ildefonse et al., 2007), providing heat to strengthen hydrothermal circulation, and exposing new reaction surfaces.\nHydrothermal fluids where isocubanite precipitated in Tianzuo hydrothermal field were significantly influenced by gabbroic intrusions and intense serpentinization reactions of ultramafic rocks, as discussed in the preceding section. These fluids are extremely enriched in metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Se, Te, Pb, Co, Bi, Cd, Ag, In, Mn, and Sn; Figs. 9 and 10 and Supplementary Fig. 2) compared with those where pyrite II precipitated, as indicated by their concentrations in these two sulfides. It is difficult to identify the specific factors controlling the distributions of trace elements in isocubanite, but earlier studies have shown that these metals are generally transported as chloro complexes at low pH and high temperatures under moderately to strongly reducing conditions. Such as, Co (and probably Ni and Mn) and particularly Se (and probably S and Te) are strongly partitioned into pyrite at high temperatures (>300\u00a0\u00b0C) under such reducing conditions (e.g., Yamamoto et al., 1984; Auclair and Fouquet, 1987; Huston et al., 1995; Hannington et al., 1999a; Hannington et al. (1999b); Schmidt et al., 2007; Maslennikov et al., 2009, 2017; Revan et al., 2014; Genna and Gaboury, 2015; Keith et al., 2016; Grant, et al., 2018); whereas Zn, Cd, Co, and Mn, and probably Pb, Bi, and Ag, strongly favor chloro complexation under low-pH and high-temperature conditions (Douville et al., 2002). Sn (and probably In) is most effectively transported as a chloro complex in acidic, reduced hydrothermal fluids at high temperatures, and is most abundant in pyrite containing micro-inclusions of chalcopyrite (Heinrich and Eadington, 1986; Heinrich 1990; Huston et al., 1995; Hannington et al., 1999a; Grant et al., 2015). Therefore, serpentinization reactions of ultramafic rocks at high temperatures significantly enhance metal extraction by hydrothermal fluids, producing abundant fluid-borne metals that are crucial for high-temperature sulfide mineralization (i.e. isocubanite). The metal contents of pyrite II are lower than those of isocubanite, as serpentinization reaction rates would have decreased with the cooling of the gabbroic intrusions, with less metal extraction occurring where pyrite II is precipitated.\nHowever, the coexistence of hematite and magnetite in serpentine minerals of the Tianzuo hydrothermal field indicates relatively oxidizing conditions during serpentinization reactions (Fig. 4f\u2013h). Previous studies have shown that the isocubanite has homogenous and higher \u03b434S values (+9.6 to\u00a0+12.2\u2030) relative to late low-temperature pyrite II (\u201323.8 to \u20133.6\u2030), indicating the presence of abundant sulfate in the reaction zone (Ding et al., 2021). The abundant sulfates may produce an oxidizing environment, with sulfur as SO4\n2\u2212 in the reaction zone. Hydrothermal fluids in the reaction zone do not become saturated in chalcophile elements, which are more soluble in oxidizing environments, and fluids with high initial metal concentrations do not precipitate sulfides (Sun et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013; Nadeau et al., 2010). The final mineralization of sulfides is controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur (S2\u2212; Sun et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2009), which requires the reduction of sulfate in the oxidized source to sulfides or polysulfides during deposition. This has been attributed mainly to magnetite crystallization inducing sulfate reduction and corresponding oxygen fugacity fluctuations, through the following reactions (Vila and Sillitoe, 1991; Mao et al., 2009; Imai et al., 2007; Khashgerel et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2009):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n12Fe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\nSO2\n-\n-\n4\n\n+\n\n12H\n2\n\nO\n=\n\n4Fe\n3\n\n\nO\n4\n\n+\n\n\nHS\n\n-\n\n+\n\n\n23H\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n6SO2\n-\n\n\n4\n\n+\n\n\n\n52H\n\n2\n\n\nO\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n57Fe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n=\n2S\n-\n3\n+\n\n19Fe\n3\n\n\nO\n4\n\n+\n1\n0\n\n\n4H\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above reactions can produce low-pH hydrothermal fluids with an enhanced ability to extract chalcophile elements, but magnetite formed by the reactions can be further oxidized to hematite through reactions such as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n38Fe\n3\n\n\nO\n4\n\n+\n6SO2\n-\n4\n+\n\n5H\n2\n\nO\n=\n\n57Fe\n2\n\n\nO\n3\n\n+\n2S\n-\n-\n3\n+\n1\n0\n\n\nOH\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tianzuo, magnetite and hematite may grow alternately (Fig. 4f\u2013h), buffering oxygen fugacity as the hematite\u2013magnetite buffer with pH values near neutral. Initial hydrothermal fluids derived from the reaction zone could thus be enriched in S\u2013 3. Experimental studies have shown that hematite\u2013magnetite redox buffer conditions are ideal for the formation of S\u2013 3, accounting for 50%\u201395% of dissolved sulfur (Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky, 2011). S\u2013 3 is similar to polysulfide ions such as S2\u2013 3 and S2\u2013 2 in that it forms strong complexes with Au, Cu, and other elements with similar behaviors in aqueous solution (Berndt et al., 1994; Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky, 2011). Sulfate reduction to S\u2013 3 is therefore very important in scavenging Cu, Au, and other similar elements (e.g., S, Se, Te, Zn, Pb, Bi, and Cd) from serpentine minerals into ore-forming fluids that are of critical importance for sulfide mineralization. The intergrowth of magnetite and hematite in serpentine minerals of the Tianzuo hydrothermal field suggests that the reactions forming them occurred in the field, explaining the higher contents of most chalcophile elements in isocubanite compared with late pyrite II.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study investigated the trace-element compositions of high-temperature isocubanite and low-temperature pyrite II from the Tianzuo hydrothermal field using in situ LA-ICP-MS analysis, in order to further understand sulfide mineralization hosted in ultramafic rocks. Our major conclusions are as follows:\n\n1.\nGabbroic intrusions provided the abundant heat driving high-temperature hydrothermal circulation and also additional metals, particularly Te, Cu, Co, and In, to the hydrothermal system where isocubanite precipitated. The intrusion of gabbroic magma also promoted serpentinization reactions, improving the extraction ability of hydrothermal fluids and resulting in the enrichment of most ore-forming metals in isocubanite, including Cd, Se, Sn, Zn, Ag, Bi, Pb, Mn, and Ni.\n\n\n2.\nPyrite II mineralization was dominated by seawater convection, with serpentinization being controlled by reactions between seawater and ultramafic rocks. Low temperatures and low rates of serpentinization reactions prevented the extraction of metals from wall rocks, leading to low concentrations of ore-forming metals in pyrite II, other than Mo, Tl, which are significantly influenced by seawater.\n\n\n3.\nThe coexistence of hematite and magnetite in serpentine minerals indicates relatively oxidizing conditions in initial hydrothermal fluids derived from the reaction zone, which would have significantly increased initial concentrations of ore-forming metals in hydrothermal fluids through enhancing the scavenging of Cu, Au, and similar elements from wall rocks during fluid migration.\n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAs one of the most important types of ore deposits, skarn deposits are very widely distributed around the world. They are an important source of iron, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, gold, tungsten, tin and other metallic minerals, thus attracting the attention of mineralogists worldwide and giving them very important economic value and industrial significance (Meinert et al., 2005). According to statistics, there are more than 386 skarn deposits in China. These skarn deposits provide 87% of the tin, 71% of the tungsten, 32% of the copper, and approximately 25% of the lead and zinc (Chang et al., 2019). In the past few decades, geologists have made many advances in the study of skarn deposits. For example, the spatial\u2013temporal evolution and alteration zoning of skarn deposits (Chelle-Michou et al., 2015; Einaudi and Burt, 1982; Einaudi et al., 1981; Meinert, 1987; Meinert et al., 2005), mineralogical characteristics (Chang and Meinert, 2004; Gaspar et al., 2008; Song et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019a), source and evolution of ore-forming fluids (Hemley et al., 1992; Hemley and Hunt, 1992; Meinert et al., 1997; Shu et al., 2013, 2017, 2021; Meinert et al., 2005), and background of metallogenic geodynamics (Einaudi et al., 1981; Mao et al., 2021; Meinert et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2019b) have been studied in depth, and valuable results have been obtained. These research results have greatly improved the understanding and knowledge about skarn deposits.\nDuring the evolution of ore-forming fluids, fluid boiling (Baker et al., 2004; Samson et al., 2008), fluid immiscibility (Baker and Lang, 2003; Fan et al., 2004; Zhang, 1997), the mixing of fluid with meteoric water (Fan et al., 2004; Soloviev et al., 2013; Zhang, 1997), and fluid-carbonate reactions (Meinert et al., 2005) are the most important mechanisms leading to the precipitation of metallic minerals. The early ore-forming fluids of skarn deposits show high temperatures and high salinities (Baker et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Kamvong and Zaw, 2009), and the temperatures and salinities of the ore-forming fluids gradually decrease with the addition of meteoric water (Fan et al., 2004; Shu et al., 2017, 2021). The ore-forming fluids of skarn deposits exhibit high temperatures and high salinities (Baker et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Kamvong and Zaw, 2009), and both anhydrous and hydrous minerals in skarn deposits are derived from magmatic fluids. The source of ore-forming materials in skarn deposits is highly controversial, and the following three main viewpoints have been proposed: (1) the ore-forming materials are derived from magma (Jiang et al., 2017; Meinert et al., 1997; Shu et al., 2013); (2) the source is a mixture of surrounding rocks and magma (Chen et al., 2017a; Ishihara et al., 2000; Zeng et al., 2009); and (3) the ore-forming materials originate only from the surrounding rocks (Gemmell et al., 1992b; Rose et al., 1985). In this paper, we have studied the fluid inclusions (FIs) and stable isotopes of the Erdaohe skarn deposit in the Great Hinggan Range (GHR), providing new evidence for the evolution of ore-forming fluid and the metallogenic mechanism in skarn deposits.\nThe GHR hosts many porphyry, skarn, epithermal, and hydrothermal vein-type ore deposits, and is one of the most important metallogenic belts in Northeast (NE) China (Wu et al., 2011b; Zeng et al., 2011; Zhai et al., 2018). The large Erdaohe Pb-Zn-Ag deposit is an important deposit in the middle segment of the GHR. Another major breakthrough in the exploration of Pb-Zn-Ag deposits in the GHR has occurred in recent years. Metal resources may increase further in the future, as exploration work at the mine is ongoing. To date, the metal resources of Pb and Zn are 354,679 tons and 1,342,399 tons, with average grades of 1.51% and 5.19%, respectively. The metal resources and grade of Ag are still being verified. The genetic type of the Erdaohe deposit has been controversial among researchers, with Wang et al. (2013) suggesting that the deposit is a skarn and medium-temperature hydrothermal vein-type superimposed deposit, Wu et al. (2013) and Liu (2014) arguing that the deposit is a medium\u2013low temperature hydrothermal deposit, and Zhang (2014) and Yang (2016) asserting that the deposit is a typical skarn deposit. Previous studies on the Erdaohe deposit have mainly focused on the geological characteristics and ore-forming geological conditions (Liu, 2014; Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013; Yang, 2016; Zhang, 2014). However, the source and evolution of ore-forming fluids, the source of ore-forming materials, and the metallogenic processes of the deposit are still poorly understood, which seriously restricts our understanding of the metallogenic mechanism of the Erdaohe deposit.\nIn this contribution, we present the detailed geology, alteration and mineralization styles of the Erdaohe deposit based on field observations. We further use FIs, laser Raman spectroscopic analysis and H\u2013O\u2013S isotopes to constrain the source and evolution of ore-forming fluids and the source of ore-forming materials. We anticipate that these studies will enable us to define the genetic type and metallogenic mechanism of the Erdaohe deposit and provide clues to the exploration for similar deposits in the GHR.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nNortheast China (NE China) is located in the eastern portion of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) (Fig. 1\na) and consists of several minor blocks (e.g., Erguna, Xing\u2019an, Songliao, and Jamusi) between the Siberian Craton and the North China Craton (\u015eeng\u00f6r et al., 1993). The GHR lies in NE China, with the Xra Moron fault to the south, the Mongol\u2013Okhotsk suture to the north, and the international border between China and Mongolia to the west (Fig. 1b). The Phanerozoic tectonic evolution in this area was characterized by closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, closure of the Mongol\u2013Okhotsk Ocean, and subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate (She et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2011a; Xiao et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2013). Multistage accretion and arc-continent collisions led to the emplacement of immense volumes of granitic magmas, accompanied by the formation of many hydrothermal deposits. Voluminous granitic magmatism during the Mesozoic occurred within the GHR, generating a series of predominantly I- and A-type granitoids (Wu et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2011a; Xiao et al., 2004).\nBased on the large dataset and a precise geochronological framework for the regional intrusion ages, these volcanic rocks and granitoids can be roughly divided into two groups, corresponding to two geotectonic episodes. The first group was emplaced during the Late Triassic\u2013Middle Jurassic, with ages ranging from 210 to 165\u00a0Ma. The second group was emplaced during the Late Jurassic\u2013Late Cretaceous, with ages of 150 to 100\u00a0Ma (Guo et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2017). The two episodes of magmatism are characterized by different rock types and tectonic settings. It was proposed that the early stage I- and A-type granitoids emplaced in the Xing\u2019an and Songliao blocks during the Late Triassic\u2013Middle Jurassic might be related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate (Wu et al., 2011a). However, the contemporaneous granitoids in the northwest are considered a response to the Mongol\u2013Okhotsk Ocean closure (Tang et al., 2016). The late stage I- and A-type granitoids are related to Paleo-Pacific subduction and a lithospheric extensional setting (Shu et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010). Numerous ore deposits have been formed during the different tectonic evolution stages in NE China. Compared with other areas in the CAOB, NE China was significantly affected by the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate and can be regarded as one of the most important regions for polymetallic Cu, Mo, Ag, Au, Pb, and Zn mineralization in the world (Hong et al., 2003).\nAccording to the descriptions of Zeng et al. (2011), the Great Hinggan Range metallogenic province can be divided into three polymetallic subbelts in accordance with their geologic settings. They are the Erguna Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Mo-Au belt in the northwestern segment, the Cu-Mo-Fe-Pb-Zn-Au belt in the northern segment, and the Pb-Zn-Ag-Cu-Sn-Fe-Mo belt in the southern segment. Numerous porphyry deposits (Duobaoshan, Tongshan, Diyanqinamu, Xing\u2019a, Chalukou, Hadatumuchang and Shiqigongli) and skarn deposits (Bagenheigeqi\u2019er, Erdaohe, Shenshan, Chaganaobao and Chaobuleng) have been discovered in the GHR (Chen et al., 2017b; Nie and Jiang, 2011; Zeng et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015). These deposits are distributed along NE-trending faults and parallel secondary faults, which are considered the main ore-controlling structures in this area.\n\n\n3\nGeology of the Erdaohe deposit\nThe Erdaohe deposit is located 45\u00a0km northwest of the town of Chaihe and is situated within the Erlian\u2013East Ujimaqin\u2013Lizishan polymetallic metallogenic belt. The regional stratigraphy in the Erdaohe district includes, from oldest to youngest, the Ordovician Duobaoshan Formation, Late Jurassic Manketou\u2019ebo Formation and Quaternary alluvial sediments (Fig. 1c). The lowermost unit is the Ordovician Duobaoshan Formation, which is mostly composed of crystal tuffs, crystalline limestone and marble. This formation is the main host for the skarn mineralization of the Erdaohe deposit. The overlying unit is the Late Jurassic Manketou\u2019ebo Formation, which comprises dominant crystal tuffs and ignimbrite. The uppermost unit consists of Quaternary sediments overlying the Duobaoshan and Manketou\u2019ebo Formations.\nIgneous rocks have been identified by geologic mapping or drilling in the Erdaohe district. The Ordovician and Jurassic strata have been intruded by several phases of intrusive rocks, including diorite and granite porphyry. Diorite and granite porphyry are well exposed at the surface and occur as stocks or dikes (Fig. 1c). Both of these rocks are generally aligned with NE-trending faults and intrude into the Ordovician Duobaoshan Formation. The diorite occurs mainly in the central part of the deposit, often in direct contact with crystal tuffs, crystalline limestone and marble (Fig. 1c). The diorite yields zircon 206Pb\/238U weighted ages of 142 to 145\u00a0Ma (Guo et al., 2021). It has a genetic relationship with skarn mineralization, although only a few diorite bodies are in direct contact with ore bodies. The granite porphyry has been dated at 125 to 129\u00a0Ma and cuts through orebodies, which indicates that it has no genetic relationship with skarn mineralization (Guo, 2020) (Fig. 2\n). Compared with the country rocks, the granite porphyry is generally fresh with little hydrothermal alteration. However, the diorite in the ore zone locally shows extensive hydrothermal alteration (epidotization, chloritization and sericitization) where it is in contact with the Duobaoshan Formation (Guo et al., 2021). The structural pattern in the Erdaohe district is dominated by a series of NE-striking faults and fractures, which provide channels for hydrothermal fluids and Pb-Zn mineralization.\nThe wallrock alteration of the Erdaohe deposit is well developed and consists mainly of skarn, silica, and carbonate alterations. Paragenetic studies based on macro- and microtextures show that skarns at Erdaohe formed in several stages (Fig. 3\n), similar to other skarns around the world (Meinert, 1992; Meinert et al., 2005). Skarn-type alterations are mainly composed of prograde and retrograde skarn mineral assemblages. Prograde skarn (anhydrous skarn) consists mostly of garnet (70\u201380%), rhodonite (<20%), and diopside (<5%). Garnets at Erdaohe show obvious color zoning, with proximal garnets being dark red-brown and massive and distal garnets becoming yellow and granular in habit (Fig. 4\na, b). Rhodonite-dominant skarns are volumetrically less abundant than garnet-dominant skarns. Rhodonite coexists locally with quartz, pyrite and sphalerite in skarn and mainly occurs as massive or disseminated subhedral crystals (Fig. 4d, e). Retrograde skarns (hydrous skarn) are predominantly composed of a mixture of epidote, tremolite, chlorite and sericite, which are alteration products of early-stage skarn minerals. Epidote is typical in retrograde skarns and locally comprises 40 to 50%, usually coexisting with garnet, rhodonite, quartz, chlorite, sphalerite and pyrite (Fig. 4h\u2013j). Geological field investigations and petrographic observations show that chlorite and sericite alterations are locally closely associated with epidote, quartz and carbonate. Tremolite is far less abundant than chlorite and sericite and is considered a retrograde alteration product of anhydrous skarns. The low-temperature alteration mineral assemblage consists of calcite-silica\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chlorite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sericite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0fluorite, which usually coexists with pyrite, sphalerite and galena (Fig. 4j\u2013r).\nThe bulk of the mineralization at Erdaohe is closely related to the distribution and style of calc-silicate alteration. As such, the deposit has a complex distribution in terms of mineralogy and concentration. The Erdaohe deposit contains 42 economic ore bodies. Most ore bodies are veined, irregular or lenticular in shape. They generally show a NE trend and dip from 20\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 to the NW. Their lengths vary mainly from 59 to 720\u00a0m, and their thicknesses are mostly between 3 and 76\u00a0m. Most sulfide ore is hosted by crystal tuffs, crystalline limestone and marble of the Ordovician Duobaoshan Formation (Fig. 2). Base-metal sulfide minerals are present in only minor amounts in the upper tuff of the Late Jurassic Manketou\u2019ebo Formation.\nSulfide mineralization can be subdivided into three types: (1) massive, (2) disseminated, and (3) veinlet (Fig. 5\na\u2013f). The major ore minerals in the Erdaohe deposit are sphalerite and galena, with less pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite and a small amount of magnetite. Ore minerals generally coexist with silicate gangue minerals, including garnet and epidote, and with subordinate quartz, calcite, chlorite, rhodonite, feldspar, diopside, and tremolite. Sphalerite and galena are the most important Zn-bearing and Pb-bearing minerals, respectively, in the Erdaohe deposit. They occur as massive or disseminated subhedral grains with other sulfides in skarn ores and in veins with quartz or calcite. Sphalerite occurs as euhedral to xenomorphic crystal aggregates and commonly contains microinclusions of chalcopyrite, i.e., exsolution structures (Fig. 5g, h). Galena occurs as euhedral to hypidiomorphic grains and coexists with sphalerite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite (Fig. 5i, k, l). Pyrite occurs as euhedral to subrounded crystals and is spatially associated with quartz, calcite and sphalerite (Fig. 5j).\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical methods\nSamples used for FI analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a012), and stable isotope (H, O, S; n\u00a0=\u00a073) studies were all selected from drill holes or open pit mines. Sample numbers and locations are presented in Table 1\n. Polished and doubly polished thin sections were examined in reflected and transmitted light.\n\n4.1\nFluid inclusion analyses\nMicrothermometric measurements and laser Raman spectroscopic analyses were conducted at the MNR Key Laboratory of Metallogeny and Mineral Assessment, Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), Beijing. FI microthermometric data were obtained using a Linkam THMS600 heating\u2013freezing stage with a temperature range of \u2212195 to +600\u00a0\u00b0C. Freezing and heating runs were undertaken using liquid nitrogen and a thermal resistor, respectively. During the cooling operation, the temperature measurement accuracy was approximately \u00b10.2\u00a0\u00b0C, while during the process of increasing the temperature, the temperature measurement accuracy was approximately \u00b12\u00a0\u00b0C. Salinities were calculated using the equation of Bodnar (1993) for the NaCl\u2013H2O system, and the salinities of halite-bearing inclusions were estimated using the data and methodology of Bodnar (1993) and Sterner et al. (1988). The composition of a single FI was identified on a Renishaw RM2000 Raman microprobe using excitation radiation (514.5\u00a0nm) from an Ar ion laser with a surface power of 5 mW. The area of the detector charge-coupled device (CCD) was 20\u00a0\u03bcm2, and the scan range of the spectrum was set between 1000 and 4000\u00a0cm\u20131 with an accumulation time of 30\u00a0s for each scan.\n\n\n4.2\nStable isotope analyses\nHydrogen, oxygen and sulfur isotope analyses were conducted at the Stable Isotope Laboratory of the Institute of Mineral Resources, CAGS, Beijing. The isotopic compositions of hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur were determined using a MAT-253 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Oxygen was extracted for analysis using the BrF5 technique (Clayton and Mayeda, 1963), and hydrogen was extracted from H2O released from FIs (Coleman et al., 1982). The isotope data were expressed in delta (\u03b4) notation as the per mil (\u2030) deviation relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water (V-SMOW), and the analytic precisions were \u00b12\u2030 for \u03b4D (1\u03c3) and \u00b10.2\u2030 for \u03b418O (2\u03c3). The \u03b434S of sulfide was measured on SO2 obtained by the reaction of sulfide and CuO with an analytical precision better than \u00b10.2\u2030 (Robinson and Kusakabe, 1975).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nFluid inclusion petrography\nPetrographic studies show that numerous FIs formed during the mineralization process. FIs occur randomly or regularly in sphalerite, calcite and quartz crystals and occasionally exist in isolation, which is characteristic of primary FIs (Roedder, 1984). Based on their compositions, phase proportions at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) and phase transitions during heating and cooling, four types of FIs are distinguished in Erdaohe samples: liquid-rich FIs (L-type), vapor-rich FIs (V-type), CO2 three-phase FIs (C-type), and daughter-mineral-bearing three-phase FIs (S-type). The types of FIs distinguished in this study are shown in Table 2\n and Fig. 6\n.\nLiquid-rich two-phase FIs (L-type) consist of a vapor bubble (VH2O) and a liquid phase (LH2O), and they lack daughter crystals at room temperature. These FIs typically occur in negative crystals and are ellipsoidal, tubular or irregular in shape. Their size range is mainly concentrated between 8 and 20\u00a0\u03bcm, with relatively small vapor bubbles (5\u201340\u00a0vol%; Fig. 6).\nVapor-rich two-phase FIs (V-type) appear colorless and transparent, with relatively large vapor bubbles (50\u201370\u00a0vol%; Fig. 6). Their shapes include ellipsoidal, elongate and negative crystals, ranging in size from 2 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm. They account for approximately 15% of the total number of FIs and commonly occur with L-type inclusions.\nCO2 three-phase FIs (C-type) consist of liquid and vapor CO2 and aqueous liquid. They are elliptical or negative crystals in shape and range in size from 10 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm and even up to 30\u00a0\u03bcm. This type of inclusion is occasionally detected in quartz veins at Erdaohe (Fig. 6i).\nDaughter mineral-bearing three-phase FIs (S-type) consist of liquid\u00a0+\u00a0vapor\u00a0+\u00a0halite daughter crystals at room temperature. They generally occur in ellipsoidal, irregular, or negative crystal shapes, ranging in size from 8 to 20\u00a0\u03bcm. The solid daughter minerals are mainly transparent or pale white angular cubes, which are identified as halite by their microscopic characteristics. This type of inclusion homogenizes by halite dissolution after vapor bubble disappearance and is generally detected in sphalerite and quartz crystals at Erdaohe.\n\n\n5.2\nResults of microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy\nThe microcalorimetric data of FIs and the calculated parameters are presented in Table 2 and graphically shown in Fig. 7\n, clearly depicting the corresponding relationships between metallogenic stage mineral assemblages and physico-chemical conditions. The laser Raman analysis spectra of FIs in quartz are illustrated in Fig. 8\n. The FIs in each mineralization stage mostly homogenize to the liquid phase, and only a few FIs homogenize to the vapor phase. The initial ice melting temperatures of the liquid-rich FIs in different mineralization stages vary from \u221224.3 to \u221219.4\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating that most of the dissolved salts are NaCl (Davis et al., 1990). The homogenization temperatures of L- and V-type FIs from the early (I) to late (III) stages vary from 338 to 475\u00a0\u00b0C (average\u00a0=\u00a0409\u00a0\u00b0C), 194 to 375\u00a0\u00b0C (average\u00a0=\u00a0291\u00a0\u00b0C), and 157 to 323\u00a0\u00b0C (average\u00a0=\u00a0215\u00a0\u00b0C), corresponding to salinities from 3.87 to 9.34, 0.35 to 8.28, and 0.18 to 6.88\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv., respectively (Fig. 7 and Table 2). Homogenization temperatures of S-type FI assemblages from stages I to II range from 369 to 427\u00a0\u00b0C (average\u00a0=\u00a0399\u00a0\u00b0C) and 242 to 383\u00a0\u00b0C (average\u00a0=\u00a0321\u00a0\u00b0C), corresponding to salinities from 38.79 to 50.72 and 31.48 to 39.05\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv, respectively (Fig. 7 and Table 2). The results of laser Raman spectroscopy show that the gas phases in the FIs are all dominated by H2O (Fig. 8). Only very few FIs contain CO2 in the gas phase.\n\n\n5.3\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes\nOxygen and hydrogen isotope data are presented in Table 3\n. The measured \u03b418O values of 9 garnet samples from stage I are 0.7 to 4.4\u2030. The measured \u03b418O values of the quartz samples in stages I, II, and III range from 3.2 to 9.6\u2030, 0.2 to 9.8\u2030, and 0.1 to 9.8\u2030, respectively. The \u03b418O fluid values are calculated according to the garnet-water equilibrium function (Taylor, 1976) and quartz-water equilibrium function (Clayton et al., 1972). The average homogenization temperature of FIs in the corresponding mineralization stage is used for the calculations. The calculated \u03b418O fluid values for the garnet samples in stage I vary between 3.5 and 7.2\u2030. The calculated \u03b418O fluid values of quartz samples from stages I to III are \u22122.3 to 5.1\u2030, \u22128.8 to 1.0\u2030, and \u221213.6 to \u22123.8\u2030, respectively. The \u03b4D values are \u2212208 to \u2212141\u2030 (stage I), \u2212161 to \u2212133\u2030 (stage II), and \u2212142 to \u2212126\u2030 (stage III).\n\n\n5.4\nSulfur isotopes\nThe sulfur isotope values of 43 metal sulfide samples from the Erdaohe deposit are listed in Table 4\n. These sulfide minerals display a narrow range from 5.2 to 10.0\u2030, with an average value of 7.7\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a043). The \u03b434S values of pyrite range from 6.0 to 10.0\u2030 (average\u00a0=\u00a08.3\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a015). The \u03b434S value of a pyrrhotite sample is 8.5\u2030. Sphalerite samples have \u03b434S values of 7.3 to 9.0\u2030 (average\u00a0=\u00a08.2\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a018), whereas galena samples record a range of \u03b434S values between 5.2 and 6.5\u2030 (average\u00a0=\u00a05.9\u2030, n\u00a0=\u00a019). The maximum and average \u03b434S values of these sulfide minerals show the following trend: \u03b434Spyrite\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b434Ssphalerite\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b434Sgalena. According to the average \u03b434S values of the three different sulfide minerals, the equilibrium temperatures between sphalerite\u2013galena, pyrite\u2013sphalerite, and pyrite\u2013galena were calculated to be 304\u00a0\u00b0C, 1553\u00a0\u00b0C, and 462\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Ohmoto, 1979; Sakai, 1968). In the above calculations, only the equilibrium temperature between sphalerite\u2013galena is consistent with the temperature of the main mineralization stage, indicating that the sulfur isotopes between sphalerite and galena may have reached fractionation equilibrium.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nNature and evolution of the fluid system\nFIs can provide crucial information on the evolution of ore-forming fluids. The homogenization temperatures and salinities of both L- and V-type and S-type FIs in the Erdaohe deposit gradually decrease from the early to the late stage (Fig. 7 and Table 2). The ore-forming fluid in pre-ore stage I is H2O\u2013NaCl\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CO2 fluid with high temperatures (338 to 475\u00a0\u00b0C) and high salinities (3.87 to 9.34 wt% NaCl equiv. and 38.79 to 50.72 wt% NaCl equiv.). As the ore-forming fluid gradually migrated upward along the faults and mixed with a small amount of meteoric water, the fluid in ore-forming stage II evolved to a medium- to high-temperature (194 to 383\u00a0\u00b0C) and variable-salinity (0.35 to 8.28 wt% NaCl equiv. and 31.48 to 39.05 wt% NaCl equiv.) H2O\u2013NaCl\u00a0+\u00a0CO2 system. The ore-forming fluid in late stage III was a H2O\u2013NaCl hydrothermal system with further decreases in temperature (157 to 323\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinity (0.18 to 6.88 wt% NaCl equiv.).\nThe development of boiling FIs is the key to determining the occurrence of fluid boiling. The coexistence of multiple types of FIs (L-type, V-type, S-type, and very small numbers of C-type) is common in quartz and sphalerite in stages I and II of the Erdaohe deposit (Fig. 6). During the temperature measurements, most of the halite crystals disappear earlier than the bubbles, and the homogenization temperatures of different types of FIs are very similar. These phenomena fully indicate that the ore-forming fluid underwent obvious boiling (Baker and Lang, 2003; Roedder, 1984).\nThe relationship between the homogenization temperature and salinity of the inclusions can well reflect the evolution of the ore-forming fluid. When fluid mixing occurs, there is a positive correlation between the homogenization temperature and salinity of FIs, and the correlation is negative when boiling occurs (Shepherd et al., 1985). From stages I to III, the homogenization temperatures and salinities of the FIs in the Erdaohe deposit display gradually decreasing trends (Fig. 9\n), implying that fluid mixing occurred during fluid evolution. It is worth noting that a negative correlation appears between the homogenization temperatures (300 to 383\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinities of the inclusions in early stage II, indicating that boiling of the fluid occurred during this stage (Fig. 9). The positive correlation between the homogenization temperatures (<300\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinities of inclusions from late stage II to stage III indicates that the fluid evolution at this time was dominated by mixing, probably influenced by the addition of meteoric water (Fig. 9), which is consistent with the trends of H and O isotope changes in stages II and III (Fig. 11\n\n).\nBased on the homogenization temperatures and salinities of daughter mineral-bearing inclusions, the densities (\u03c1) of the fluids in stages I and II are calculated to be 1.00\u20131.16\u00a0g\/cm3 (average 1.04\u00a0g\/cm3) and 1.00\u20131.09\u00a0g\/cm3 (average 1.04\u00a0g\/cm3), respectively, and the pressures (P) are 16.4\u201371.3\u00a0MPa (average 28.5\u00a0MPa) and 2.5\u201316.1\u00a0MPa (average 8.7\u00a0MPa) (Bodnar, 1983; Bodnar, 1994). Based on the homogenization temperatures and salinities of the liquid-rich two-phase FIs, the densities of the fluids in stages I, II and III are calculated to be 0.39\u20130.71\u00a0g\/cm3 (average 0.56\u00a0g\/cm3), 0.54\u20130.89\u00a0g\/cm3 (average 0.75\u00a0g\/cm3) and 0.67\u20130.92\u00a0g\/cm3 (average 0.86\u00a0g\/cm3) with pressures ranging from 13.7 to 54.7\u00a0MPa (average 30.7\u00a0MPa), 1.3 to 21.7\u00a0MPa (average 8.1\u00a0MPa), and 0.6 to 11.7\u00a0MPa (average 2.3\u00a0MPa), respectively (Bodnar, 1983; Bodnar, 1994). From stages I to III, the density of the ore-forming fluid gradually increases while the pressure gradually decreases. The calculated values of density and pressure are basically the same as those obtained from the phase diagram of the NaCl\u2013H2O system (Fig. 10).\n\n\n6.2\nSource of ore-forming fluids\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes together with the homogenization temperatures of FIs are highly effective in tracing the origin of ore-forming fluids (Hoefs, 2009; Pirajno, 2008). The \u03b418Ofluid values of garnet in stage I range from 3.5 to 7.2\u2030, slightly lower than the values of magmatic water (+5.5 to +10), and the \u03b4D values are very low (\u2212176 to \u2212208\u2030), significantly lower than those of magmatic water (Sheppard, 1986; Taylor, 1974). In open magmatic-hydrothermal systems, continuous degassing during the late crystallization stage often leads to lower \u03b4D values in the residual phase, while the effect on \u03b418Ofluids is smaller (Harris and Golding, 2002; Hedenquist et al., 1998; Rye, 1993; Shmulovich et al., 1999). No secondary FIs or boiling phenomena are identified in the garnet (stage I) from the Erdaohe deposit, and such \u03b4D and \u03b418Ofluid values indicate that the parent magma was an open system and may have undergone continuous degassing and water\u2013rock reactions.\nRetrograde minerals in skarn deposits can form in a single magmatic-hydrothermal system (Meinert et al., 2003) or in hydrothermal fluids that are mixed with meteoric water (Polya et al., 2000; Shu et al., 2013). From stages I to III, the values of \u03b418O fluids gradually decrease while the value of \u03b4D gradually increases, and the sample points gradually approach the Jurassic to Cretaceous meteoric water end member (Fig. 11). These results indicate that meteoric water was gradually added to the ore-forming fluid, which had a certain modification effect on the primary ore-forming fluid. In addition, water\u2013rock reactions are important factors affecting the composition of \u03b418OH2O and \u03b4D. Since the hydrogen content in rocks is much lower than that in hydrothermal fluids, the \u03b4D values in hydrothermal fluids are strongly influenced by local meteoric water, while water\u2013rock reactions have a strong influence on oxygen isotope values (Craig, 1966). During the ascent of ore-forming fluid along fractures, the temperature gradually decreases, and the oxygen isotope fractionation between water and rock increases. The higher \u03b418O values of the precipitated minerals in the ore-forming fluid and the lower \u03b418O values in the ore-forming fluid result in a negative drift of oxygen isotopes in the minerals formed from the early to late stage. From stages I to III, the \u03b4D values of the ore-forming fluid from the Erdaohe deposit gradually increase while the \u03b418Ofluid value gradually decreases, which is probably due to the dual effects of meteoric water and water\u2013rock reactions.\n\n\n6.3\nSource of ore-forming materials\nThe study of sulfur isotopes in sulfide minerals from ore deposits provides valuable information on the source of sulfur in ore-forming fluids, which is essential for understanding the precipitation conditions of metallic ore minerals (Barnes, 1997; Ohmoto, 1972). The sulfide composition of the Erdaohe Pb-Zn deposit is relatively simple, consisting of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, pyrrhotite and minor chalcopyrite. The large amount of pyrrhotite and the absence of sulfate minerals in the deposit suggest that the sulfide precipitated in an environment with low oxygen fugacity; thus, the \u03b434S values of the sulfides can approximately represent the total sulfur isotope (\u03b434S\u03a3S) values in the hydrothermal fluid (Ohmoto, 1972). The maximum and average \u03b434S values of sulfide minerals in the Erdaohe deposit show the following trend: \u03b434Spyrite\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b434Ssphalerite\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b434Sgalena.\nGenerally, sulfur isotopes in skarn Pb-Zn deposits may have multiple sources, mainly including the following: (1) sulfur of magmatic origin, which has \u03b434S values mostly concentrated at approximately 0 with a small range of variation, an obvious tower distribution, and an average sulfur isotope composition very close to that of meteorites (Ault and Williams-Jones, 2004; Kamvong and Zaw, 2009; Meinert et al., 1997; Ohmoto, 1986); (2) sulfur from wallrocks, such as carbonate and tuff, with large differences in the sulfur isotope composition (Gemmell et al., 1992a; Rose et al., 1985; Saravanan and Mishra, 2009); or (3) a mixture of these two sources (Ishihara et al., 2000; Yokoro et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2003).\nThe \u03b434S values of sulfide minerals in the Erdaohe deposit range from 5.2 to 10.0\u2030, with an average value of 7.7\u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a043; Fig. 12\na). These \u03b434S values are significantly higher than those of skarn deposits in the Great Hinggan Range, such as the Baiyinnuo'er Pb-Zn, Bagenheigeqi'er Pb-Zn, Haobugao Fe-Zn and Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposits, and many other magmatic-hydrothermal deposits (Jiang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2015; Shu et al., 2013; Zhai et al., 2014; Fig. 12b). It is worth noting that many researchers have found that \u03b434S enrichment in porphyry, skarn and magmatic-hydrothermal deposits is relatively common and have suggested that sulfur is sourced from magma (Cooke et al., 2011; Deng et al., 2015; Li and Santosh, 2014; Meinert et al., 2005; Seal, 2006; Stein and Hannah, 1985). The \u03b434S values of sulfide minerals in the Erdaohe deposit are concentrated and have a narrow variation range, with a relatively obvious tower-like distribution, reflecting magmatic sulfur isotope characteristics. The high \u03b434S values of sulfide minerals in the Erdaohe deposit are probably the result of magmatic sulfur mixing with sulfur from the surrounding Duobaoshan Formation (i.e., crystal tuffs, limestone and marble).\n\n\n6.4\nOre genesis\nThe main lithologies of the strata in the Erdaohe deposit include crystal tuff, marble and crystalline limestone. The Pb-Zn ore bodies are mainly hosted in and around different lithological layers of volcaniclastic and carbonate rocks. The Si\u2013Ca interface with abrupt changes in rock chemical properties and the bedding detachment faults caused by tectonics during the mineralization period played important roles in controlling mineralization. First, there are obvious differences in the physical properties of the two rock types at the lithological interface. It is especially easy to form an interlayer fracture zone under regional tectonic movement, which constitutes the ore-holding space and decompression zone. Second, the chemical properties of the two rocks at the lithological interface are obviously different, which can easily form mineralization geochemical barriers. This can cause rapid changes in the physical and chemical conditions of the ore-forming fluid, resulting in the massive precipitation of minerals. Field geological investigations show that diorite (145\u2013142\u00a0Ma) occurs in the ore body or at the edge of the ore body. Intense epidotization, chloritization and sericitization are accompanied by weak Pb-Zn mineralization, which often develops within and along the sides of the diorite. Therefore, diorite is considered to be associated with mineralization (Guo et al., 2021). Based on the field geological survey, combined with the obtained diorite ages, we speculate that the Erdaohe deposit formed at ~145\u00a0Ma. Based on the study of the geological characteristics, geochronology, ore-forming fluid properties and evolution of the Erdaohe skarn Pb-Zn deposit, combined with the regional geological background, we construct a genetic model of the Erdaohe deposit (Fig. 13\n).\n\n(1)\nDuring the Early Cretaceous (~145\u00a0Ma), depleted mantle material partially melted and then formed juvenile lower crust under the influence of the subducting Paleo-Pacific plate (Guo et al., 2021; Shu et al., 2016). After the partial melting of the juvenile lower crust, the initial magma chamber of the Erdaohe deposit developed. In the process of ascent and emplacement of the magma from the magma chamber, due to the gradual decreases in temperature and pressure and the continuous crystallization of water-rich minerals (biotite, amphibole, etc.), the magma gradually reached a water-saturated state, causing the fluid phase and the melt phase to separate. The initial ore-forming fluid was then formed with high temperature, high salinity, and low density (compared to the melt phase); this fluid was rich in metallogenic material (Ag, Pb, Zn and Cu) and volatile components.\n\n\n(2)\nThe initial ore-forming fluid driven by magmatic heat migrated upward along fractures, assimilated S, Pb and Zn from the surrounding rocks (Jiao et al., 2021; Guo, 2020), and experienced intense degassing. Then, it migrated to the interlayer detachment structures and intralayer fracture structures and caused contact metamorphism at the Si\u2013Ca interface where rock chemistry changes abruptly (i.e., between and near different lithologic layers of volcaniclastic rocks and carbonate rocks in the deposit), forming anhydrous skarn minerals (i.e., garnet, diopside and rhodonite). With the slow decrease in the temperature and pressure of the ore-forming fluid and the addition of meteoric water, hydrous skarn minerals (i.e., epidote, chlorite, and tremolite) are gradually formed, with some amount of magnetite.\n\n\n(3)\nThe increase in the volume of CO2 and hydrous skarn minerals generated during the metamorphic process causes the local pressure to exceed the static rock pressure, resulting in fracture of the surrounding rocks. The pressure of the ore-forming fluid was released due to expansion, which caused the fluid to boil and intermingle toward the rock fracture site. These fractures also provided transport channels for the infiltration of meteoric water. The boiling and mixing of the ore-forming fluids and the decreases in temperature and pressure together led to the extensive precipitation of Pb-Zn and other metallic minerals in the ore-forming fluid at the interlayer detachment structures, intralayer fracture structures, and the Si\u2013Ca interface where the rock chemistry abruptly changed.\n\n\n(4)\nDuring the late stage of mineralization, a large amount of low-temperature, low-salinity meteoric water was added to the ore-forming fluid along the fissures in the surrounding rocks. This mixing resulted in significant decreases in the temperature, salinity, and H+ and Cl\u2212 concentrations of the ore-forming fluid. Only small-scale local mineralization occurred at this stage, with many quartz\u2013carbonate veins cutting through the skarn and ore bodies. Mineralization was almost complete as the ore-forming fluid continued to migrate upward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThis paper presents a detailed study of the ore-forming characteristics and metallogenic mechanism from the perspectives of ore body location, FIs, and hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur isotopes of the Erdaohe skarn Pb-Zn deposit, and the main conclusions reached are as follows:\n\n(1)\nThe Si\u2013Ca interface with abrupt changes in rock chemical properties and the bedding detachment faults in the Erdaohe deposit played important roles in controlling mineralization.\n\n\n(2)\nFIs, laser Raman analysis and H\u2013O isotope studies reveal that the initial ore-forming fluid was mainly derived from magma and underwent intense degassing. From stages I to III, the temperature, salinity and pressure of the ore-forming fluid slowly decreased while the density gradually increased. The boiling of ore-forming fluids, reductions in temperature and pressure, and mixing with meteoric water played crucial roles in the precipitation of Pb-Zn metallic minerals.\n\n\n(3)\nThe high \u03b434S values of sulfide minerals in the Erdaohe deposit may be the result of the mixing of magmatic sulfur and sulfur from the surrounding Duobaoshan Formation.\n\n\n(4)\nDuring the Early Cretaceous (~145\u00a0Ma), the initial magma chamber of the Erdaohe deposit was formed after partial melting of the juvenile lower crust under the influence of the subducting Paleo-Pacific plate. The ore-bearing fluid evolved from the magma and produced large-scale contact metasomatism near the lithological interface between tuff and carbonate rocks, which then formed the Erdaohe skarn deposit.\n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAmong the so-called critical and energy critical metals and metalloids, indium (In), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), and tellurium (Te) are important commodities for future sustainable development (Buchert et al., 2012). The rare metals In, Ga and Ge are mostly used for high-technology applications and are essential for electronic components (Frenzel et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2017). Moreover, Ge has major applications in optical materials and indium in liquid crystal displays (Frenzel et al., 2014). Germanium and In are recovered from zinc production during refining (Frenzel et al., 2017). Tellurium, a relatively rare metalloid, is used in manufacturing semi-conductors and thermo-electric devices, but\u00a0~\u00a040% of the world\u2019s Te production is used in the photovoltaic industry, where the highest efficiency rates are achieved by CdTe cells (Gloeckner et al., 2013). However, most tellurium is currently recovered as a by-product of copper refining, likely causing bottlenecks in the supply chain in the near future (Goldfarb, 2015). Hence, new resources must be discovered to secure the future supply of these rare commodities for the high-tech industry.\nThe mineralogy of In, Ge, and Ga has been extensively studied in several types of ore deposits including skarns (Imai and Choi, 1984; Ishihara et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2021), modern submarine hydrothermal vent systems and their ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) analogs (Schwarz-Schampera and Herzig, 1997; Ishihara et al., 2006; Monecke et al., 2016; Frenzel et al., 2016a, 2019), epithermal polymetallic deposits (Kovalenker et al., 1993; Ono et al., 2004; Kovalenker and Plotinskaya, 2005; Jovic et al., 2011a, 2011b), and Mississippi Valley-type deposits (H\u00f6ll et al., 2007). Indium is particularly abundant in the so-called Sn-polymetallic belts of Bolivia, Japan, China, and Europe in porphyry- and greisen-type deposits, and in veins linked to granitic intrusions (Seifert and Sandmann, 2006; Ishihara et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006; Murakami and Ishihara, 2013; Frenzel et al. 2017). The most abundant mineral containing essential In is roquesite (CuInS2); however, several other rarer indium minerals such as sakuraiite [(Cu,Zn,Fe,In,Sn)4S4], petrukite [(Cu,Fe,Zn)2(Sn,In)S4], and indite (FeIn2S4) have also been reported (Shimizu and Kato, 1991; Cook et al., 2011a, 2011b; Cook and Ciobanu, 2015). Other indium carriers include sphalerite, chalcopyrite, stannite, ferrok\u00ebsterite, stannoidite, and possibly tetrahedrite\u2013tennantite (Schwarz-Schampera and Herzig, 2002; Gaspar, 2002; Cook et al., 2011a, 2011b; Jovic et al., 2011a, 2011b; Ko\u0142odziejczyk et al., 2016; Frenzel et al., 2019). Sphalerite can contain up to several wt% In; however, it only rarely exceeds\u00a0~\u00a01000\u00a0ppm (Schwarz-Schampera and Herzig, 2002; Cook et al., 2009a; Murakami and Ishihara, 2013; Frenzel et al., 2016a).\nAnalogously, Ge may form Ge-bearing minerals such as germanite, renierite, and argyrodite (H\u00f6ll et al. 2007), but most commonly, Ge occurs as an impurity in other sulfides and sulfosalts such as enargite, tennantite, galena, and sphalerite. The distribution and concentration of Ga and Ge in sphalerite have been the subject of numerous studies (e.g., Cook et al., 2009a, 2011a, 2011b; Ye et al., 2011; Belissont et al., 2014, 2016; Frenzel et al., 2016a, 2016b; Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2017a, 2017b; Cugerone et al., 2018, 2021).\nTellurium is known to be enriched in a wide range of ore deposits including VMS, orogenic and intrusion-related gold, epithermal-porphyry, Carlin-type, and skarn deposits (Cook et al., 2009b; Martin et al., 2019; Kelley and Spry, 2016; Keith et al., 2018, 2020). However, recent studies show that epithermal deposits may particularly be interesting for the recovery of Te, since concentrations may reach wt% levels in the bulk ore (Pals and Spry, 2003; Fornadel et al., 2012; Kelley and Spry, 2016; Smith et al., 2017; Keith et al., 2018, 2020; Kadel-Harder et al., 2020). These high concentrations are typically related to the presence of various precious metal-bearing tellurides, such as calaverite, sylvanite, hessite, and petzite that contribute to the gold budget in epithermal deposits (e.g., Cook et al., 2009b; Zhai and Liu, 2014; Kelley and Spry, 2016; Zhai et al., 2018; Keith et al., 2020), where they may also form inclusions in hydrothermal pyrite causing Te concentrations of several wt% in the host mineral (Keith et al., 2018, 2020).\nThe epithermal\/subepithermal polymetallic veins of the Rhodope province are the most promising ore types for In, Ge, Ga, Te, and Se exploitation in Greece (e.g., Sapes, Perama Hill, Pefka and St Philippos; Voudouris, 2006; Melfos and Voudouris, 2012, 2017; Voudouris et al., 2019; Mavrogonatos et al., 2019, 2020). According to Voudouris et al. (2013), the St Philippos ores contain relatively high concentrations of Se (up to 8\u00a0ppm), Te (up to 16\u00a0ppm), In (up to 48\u00a0ppm), Ga (up to 290\u00a0ppm), and Ge (>100\u00a0ppm), which may be related to the enrichments of In, Ga, and Ge in wurtzite (Driesner and Pintea, 1994; Skarpelis, 1999). Wurtzite is the dominant Zn-ore mineral in the St Philippos deposit, along with sphalerite, and contains up to 3.5\u00a0wt% In and up to 1.6\u00a0wt% Ga, whereas Ge is present in lesser amount (<0.3\u00a0wt%) (Driesner and Pintea, 1994). Previous analyses of bulk ore samples from the Pefka mineralization (Melfos and Voudouris, 2012) revealed a high In content (up to 675\u00a0ppm) and\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0ppm Te, but do not show a distinct Ga and Ge enrichment. However, In-bearing minerals, while reported from these ore deposits, were not analyzed to determine their compositions (Voudouris et al., 2019).\nThe Pefka and St Philippos deposits are high-grade vein- and breccia-type systems and one of several HS to IS polymetallic deposits in northeastern Greece (Mo\u00eblo et al., 1985; Voudouris, 2006; Repstock et al., 2015). Both deposits were exploited from surface workings, mine shafts, and underground workings, probably since antiquity. For the Pefka deposit, production data are missing. For St Philippos, an estimated total production during modern times (from about 1930 to 1998), was 150.000\u00a0t of ore at 4 to 10% combined Pb and Zn. Lead concentrates at 60\u201370% Pb, 3\u20137% Cu, and 500\u00a0g\/t Ag, and Zn concentrates at 48\u201354% Zn and 0.4\u20130.5% Cd were produced (Skarpelis, 1999). Previous studies of the Pefka mine described an exceptional and rare ore mineralogy consisting of various sulfides, sulfosalts (e.g., enargite, colusite, goldfieldite, watanabeite, and Cu-excess tennantite), tellurides (coloradoite, altaite, hessite, st\u00fctzite), and native gold and tellurium (Michael et al., 1989a; Dimou et al., 1994; Voudouris, 2006; Repstock et al., 2015, 2016). The St Philippos deposit contains several Pb-As-Cu-Ag-Bi-Sn sulfosalts (Dimou, 1993; Skarpelis, 1999; Voudouris et al., 2005, 2013) and is the type locality of kirkiite, Pb10Bi3As3S19, and l\u00e9vyclaudite, Pb8Sn7Cu3(Bi,Sb)3S28 (Mo\u00eblo et al., 1985, 1990).\nThe current contribution evaluates the In-, Ge-, Ga-, Se-, Te-, Bi-, (Mn-), and Au- and Ag-mineralogy of the Pefka and St Philippos epithermal polymetallic deposits by expanding on previous work, emphasizing previously unreported tellurides, as well as In- and Mn-bearing sulfides and sulfosalts, and discusses several newly discovered unnamed phases in the deposits. Instead, we focus on the discovery of roquesite, In-tennantite and the tellurides calaverite, krennerite, sylvanite, kostovite, empressite, and tellurantimony at Pefka, and of Mn-k\u00ebsterite, unnamed Cu2MnSnS4, unnamed Cu2(Mn,Zn)SnS4, Mn- and Zn-bearing analogs of mawsonite and stannoidite, \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d, unnamed (Cu,Mn,Fe)8As3S9, and the tellurides altaite, hessite, and tsumoite at St Philippos. Based on new mineral-chemical data on these rare mineral phases, and on new bulk trace-element contents of several mineralized samples, this study attempts to improve knowledge of the critical and rare metal endowment in Greece, by investigating their detailed mineralogy and the conditions under which they formed. In this context, we define the physicochemical fluid conditions during formation of the critical metal and metalloid mineralization at the Pefka and St Philippos deposits, and compare them with the conditions of formation of other similar occurrences elsewhere by utilizing available experimental and thermodynamic data. This new information can be used to obtain a better understanding on the origin of these rare commodities and their genetic relationship to the spatially related magmatic system. Beyond this, we aim to identify pathfinders that can be used for the exploration of HS precious- and critical element-bearing deposits in Greece and elsewhere.\n\n\n2\nGeological overview and tectonic setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geological setting\nIn the Rhodope Massif (Bulgaria and northeastern Greece), Late Cretaceous-Tertiary exhumation of deep metamorphic rocks along detachment faults resulted in the formation of metamorphic core complexes, supra-detachment sedimentary basins, and is associated with widespread Late Eocene to Early Miocene mafic to felsic magmatism (Marchev et al., 2005). The process of magma generation is still debated; previous work suggests that slab break-off and\/or slab delamination mechanisms were responsible for the formation of magmas (e.g., Christofides et al., 1998), or that, according to Jones et al. (1992) and Marchev et al. (2005), magma formation was favored by post-collisional extension in the back-arc of the retreating Hellenic subduction zone during the Oligocene to Miocene. Slab roll-back of a single subducting slab resulted in the progressive southward migration of magmatic activity from the Cretaceous Timok-Banat-Srednogorie magmatic belts, via the Tertiary in the Rhodope Massif, to the active South Aegean volcanic arc reflecting the present position of the subduction zone (Jolivet and Brun, 2010). In accordance with the southwards migration of the magmatic activity, Schaarschmidt et al. (2021a,b) recently emphasized an arc signature of the Oligocene igneous rocks in the region and demonstrated an enrichment of K, LILE, and HFSE in the mantle source by slab-derived components (i.e., sediment melts). The volcanic activity occurred between 33.4 and 19.1\u00a0Ma, based on K-Ar whole rock data given by Pecskay et al. (2003) and Christofides et al. (2004). Magmatic activity was followed by intense hydrothermal alteration of the magmatic rocks and the widespread formation of porphyry Cu-Mo-Au-Re and HS to IS epithermal Au-Ag-Te-style deposits (Arikas and Voudouris, 1998, Voudouris et al., 2013; Fig. 1\n).\n\n\n2.2\nGeology of the Pefka and St Philippos area\nThe Tertiary Loutra-Pefka-Feres basin is covered by Middle to Upper Eocene sedimentary rocks, Upper Eocene to Oligocene pyroclastics, and Oligocene to Miocene volcanic rocks (Fig. 1a,b). The volcanic rocks in the Pefka area are of intermediate to felsic calc-alkaline composition including andesites to rhyodacites that are associated with shoshonitic rocks (Michael et al., 1989a; Arikas and Voudouris, 1998). Volcanic activity consisted of two mafic and two felsic stages, which resulted in the formation of tuffs, lava flows, lava domes, and pyroclastic flows (Michael, 2004; Marantos et al., 2009). Intermediate lavas are composed of pyroxene-, biotite-pyroxene-, and amphibole-biotite-bearing varieties. Rhyolites and pyroclastics contain quartz and biotite phenocrysts. The largest prospect within Pefka-Loutros district is the Pefka high-intermediate sulfidation (HS-IS) epithermal Cu-Au-Ag-Te deposit hosted by andesites (Michael et al., 1989a; Voudouris, 2006; Fig.\u00a01b). Koukos Hill, on top of the Pefka mine, is covered by hydrothermally altered tuffs and breccias of rhyodacitic composition (Michael et al., 1989a; Arikas and Voudouris, 1998; Fig.\u00a01b). Volcanic rocks in the area are crosscut by mineralized NNW-, NE-, and E-trending veins and faults (Figs.\u00a01b and 2a,b).\nThe geology of the St Philippos area is dominated by Oligocene-Miocene subvolcanic stocks and dikes of calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline affinity (Fig.\u00a01c). A basal-clastic unit of Middle to Upper Eocene age, including tuffaceous material, discordantly overlies the metamorphic basement. A volcanic sequence, consisting of lava domes, flows, and pyroclastics of andesitic to dacitic composition was intruded at about 32\u00a0Ma (Del Moro et al., 1988) by I-type subvolcanic dacitic-andesitic and monzodioritic bodies. All these lithologies are cut by rhyolitic dikes, which were intruded mainly along NNW-SSE trending faults. The St Philippos mineralization is hosted by Eocene sediments and is spatially related to Upper Oligocene quartz-feldspar (i.e., microgranite) porphyries exposed in the northern part of the mining area (Figs 1c and 2f,g,h,k).\n\n\n2.3\nMineralization and alteration at Pefka and St Philippos\nThe Pefka area is characterized by epithermal-style alteration and mineralization. Outcrops of silicic (both vuggy and massive silica) and advanced argillic alteration (quartz-alunite-kaolinite) related to E-trending faults occur mostly in the southern and western part of the district and are enclosed outwards and downwards by sericitic and argillic alteration (Fig.\u00a01b). NNW- and E-trending veins of black, massive silica with pyrite related to sericitic alteration of the wallrocks are considered to represent both feeder zones and deeper unmineralized levels of the HS silica bodies. Precious and base metal mineralization occurs at the Pefka mine in the north, and at the Loutros quarry in the south, but is also widespread throughout the area (Fig.\u00a01b). The Pefka mine is located at the eastern slope of Koukos Hill, about 1\u00a0km north of Pefka village (Fig.\u00a01b). Silicic- and sericite-adularia alteration is exposed on top of Koukos Hill, while silicification is associated with a stockwork of epithermal-style colloform banded quartz-chalcedony veins. Two distinct styles of mineralization occur at the Pefka deposit: (1) early NNW-trending, HS quartz, enargite\/luzonite, and gold veins (Fig.\u00a02\na,c); and (2) later NE-trending, IS carbonate veins and breccias hosting tennantite, and tellurides, which locally overprint the HS veins (Fig.\u00a02b,d,e). The enargite-Au and the carbonate-telluride veins are enveloped by sericitic to argillic and intermediate argillic alteration of the host rock, respectively (Fig.\u00a02a,b). Sericite and barite are gangue minerals in the enargite-bearing veins. Some loose boulders at higher topographic levels in the vicinity of the mine contain massive platy calcite and probably represent eroded higher-level segments of the carbonate-telluride veins.\nThe St Philippos Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag-Bi-Sn-In-U mineralization is exposed in an open pit (Figs 1c and 2f-p) and reflects a polymetallic vein deposit with IS to HS affinities that contains an unusual mineralogy consisting of several Pb-As-Cu-Ag-Bi-Sn sulfosalts (Mo\u00eblo et al., 1985; Michael et al., 1989b; Dimou, 1993; Skarpelis, 1999; Voudouris et al., 2005, 2013). The deposit is structurally controlled by two normal NNW-trending faults, and the mineralization occurs in the form of breccias and crustiform massive sulfide ores (Fig.\u00a02g-i and l-p). Several mineralogical studies (Mo\u00eblo et al., 1985; Vavelidis et al., 1989; Michailidis et al., 1989; Dimou, 1993; Skarpelis, 1999; Voudouris et al., 2005, 2013) identified the following minerals: pyrite, sphalerite, wurtzite, galena, jordanite, Bi-bearing jordanite, kirkiite, cosalite, chalcopyrite, marcasite, bismuthinite, luzonite, enargite, seligmannite, bournonite, stannite, and covellite. Kaolinite\/dickite, sericite, pyrophyllite, APS minerals, and barite are gangue minerals.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\nOne hundred and forty samples of host rocks and sulfide mineralization were collected during several sampling campaigns between 1996 and 2019. Seventy-eight thin- and polished-sections of surface samples from host rocks and sulfide mineralization were studied by optical microscopy and a JEOL JSM 5600 scanning electron microscope, equipped with back-scattered imaging capabilities, at the Department of Mineralogy and Petrology, University of Athens. The chemical composition of the sulfides, sulfosalts, and tellurides was determined by a Cameca-SX 100 wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe at the Department of Mineralogy and Petrology, University of Hamburg, and using a JEOL JXA-8530FPlus Electron Probe Microanalyzer at the University of Minnesota. Quantitative analyses at both laboratories were performed with an acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV, a beam current of 20nA, and a beam diameter\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm. Elemental maps were collected with an acceleration voltage of 20\u00a0kV, a beam current of 100 or 200nA, and a focused beam. Count times varied from 20 to 60\u00a0s depending on the expected element concentration. The following X-ray lines were used at both Hamburg and Minnesota: AgL\u03b1, AsL\u03b1, AuM\u03b1, BiM\u03b2, CuK\u03b1, FeK\u03b1, HgM\u03b1, InL\u03b1, PbM\u03b1, PdL\u03b1, SK\u03b1, SbL\u03b1, SnL\u03b1, SeL\u03b1, TeL\u03b1, and ZnK\u03b1. To ensure an accurate Sn and In analysis X-ray lines of both elements were monitored due to potential peak overlaps. The SnL\u03b1 X-ray line sat on the edge of the InL\u03b1 X-ray line, but measured values of Sn in In-bearing minerals were below the detection limit. Hence, we consider that the values for both In and Sn in samples containing one of both elements to be real and to not reflect any interference from peak overlap.\nStandards used at Minnesota were pure elements (for Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Ni, Sb, Se and Te), indium arsenide (for As and In), pyrite (for Fe and S), galena (for Pb), sphalerite (for Zn), HgS (for Hg), CdS (for Cd), SnS (for Sn), MnS (for Mn), GaS (for Ga), and GeS (for Ge). The standards used at Hamburg were pure elements (for Ag, Au, Bi, Pd, Se, Te), pyrite and chalcopyrite (for Fe, Cu, and S), galena (for Pb), sphalerite (for Zn), HgS (for Hg), Sb2S3 (for Sb), SnO2 (for Sn), and synthetic GaAs (for As). Average detection limits are as follows: Ag: 591\u00a0ppm, As: 499\u00a0ppm, Au: 895\u00a0ppm, Bi: 926\u00a0ppm, Cd: 752\u00a0ppm, Co: 170\u00a0ppm, Cu: 254\u00a0ppm, Fe: 199\u00a0ppm, Ga: 337\u00a0ppm, Ge: 442\u00a0ppm, Hg: 965\u00a0ppm, In: 290\u00a0ppm, Mn: 161\u00a0ppm, Ni: 199\u00a0ppm, Pb: 884\u00a0ppm, S: 175\u00a0ppm, Sb: 314\u00a0ppm, Se: 201\u00a0ppm, Sn: 318\u00a0ppm, Te: 282\u00a0ppm, Zn: 284\u00a0ppm. Mineralized samples were analyzed for their bulk trace-element contents by 1:1:1 Aqua Regia digest by ICP-MS analysis at ACME analytical laboratories (Vancouver, Canada) using package AQ251.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nParagenetic sequence\nPrevious mineralogical studies of the Pefka deposit indicated that veins contain an early HS assemblage that includes pyrite, galena, galena-clausthalite, enargite, luzonite, colusite, arsenosulvanite, watanabeite, goldfieldite, covellite, chalcopyrite, Cu-excess tennantite-tetrahedrite, chalcostibite, and native gold. This was succeeded by a late IS ore assemblage consisting of sphalerite, Zn-bearing tetrahedrite group minerals, chalcopyrite, hessite, st\u00fctzite, altaite, coloradoite, and native tellurium (Voudouris, 2006; Repstock et al., 2015; Voudouris et al., 2019). This study demonstrates that In-bearing phases (i.e., roquesite, and In-rich \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d, and Cu-rich \u201ctennantite-(In)\u201d) were introduced during the HS- and transitional HS to IS stages, and that Te was already added to the hydrothermal system during the HS stage as reflected by the presence of the Te-bearing fahlores \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d, \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d, and tellurides (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n). The precipitation of In-Cu-bearing tetrahedrite-group minerals represent transitional HS-IS conditions (Fig. 3).\nAt St Philippos, an evolution from HS to IS fluid states is supported by the deposition of early pyrite, and Fe-poor sphalerite followed by bismuthinite, Bi-bearing jordanite, kirkiite, and then by enargite, covellite, watanabeite, pearceite, k\u00ebsterite, stannite, mohite, and, finally, by tennantite, minor chalcopyrite and galena (Voudouris et al., 2013, 2019). Dickite, alunite-group minerals, pyrophyllite, and barite gangue (Dimou, 1993; Skarpelis, 1999) associated with earlier ores, and calcite in the later stages, confirms the paragenetic sequence proposed here. The mineralogical observations suggest that the Sn-sulfosalts and the In-Ge-Ga-bearing sphalerite formed during the HS stage at St Philippos. Tellurides are included in Fe-rich \"tennantite-(Mn)\" and Mn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe) and were formed during the HS-IS transition (Figs. 3 and 5\n).\nIt is concluded here that indium-, tin-, germanium-, gallium-, gold-, and tellurium-bearing minerals, which represent important repositories of these critical metals and metalloids, formed throughout the entire paragenetic sequences in both deposits, both during HS and IS conditions.\n\n\n4.2\nOre petrography and mineral chemistry\n\n4.2.1\nSulfides\n\n4.2.1.1\nPyrite\nPyrite is a minor phase at Pefka, where it occurs throughout the paragenetic sequence, as isolated euhedral to subhedral grains within quartz and carbonate matrix of the quartz-enargite and carbonate veins, respectively. Pyrite contains up to 0.13\u00a0wt% Cu and 0.38\u00a0wt% Pb at Pefka. At St Philippos, pyrite also occurs as euhedral to subhedral crystals (up to 1\u00a0cm in size). It generally occurs in massive aggregates in close association with sphalerite. Pyrite contains bismuthinite inclusions and is surrounded by Fe-, and Cu-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d (Fig.\u00a05a-c). It also includes seligmanite (PbCuAsS3) and jordanite (Pb14(As,Sb)6S23). Pyrite, together with enargite and k\u00ebsterite, is also enclosed in quartz (Fig.\u00a05b). EPMA data show that pyrite at St Philippos contains up to 0.59\u00a0wt% Cu, 0.34\u00a0wt% Pb, and 0.13\u00a0wt% Ag; concentrations of As and Te are below detection limits.\n\n\n4.2.1.2\nSphalerite - wurtzite (ZnS)\nSphalerite is a rare mineral at Pefka and formed during the IS event in association with tellurides (Fig.\u00a04a). Sphalerite exhibits chalcopyrite disease due to late replacement by Cu-rich solutions. Copper contents of up to 1.39\u00a0wt% is likely due to sub-micron-sized inclusions of chalcopyrite in sphalerite. The Fe and Cd contents vary from 0.27 to 1.27\u00a0wt% (0.5\u20132.6\u00a0mol% FeS), and 0.07 to 1.74\u00a0wt%, respectively, while Mn reaches up to 0.16\u00a0wt% (Table 1\n). Sphalerite at Pefka contains up to 0.31\u00a0wt% In and has no detectable Ga and Ge.\nSphalerite at St Philippos deposit occurs in the form of inclusions in Zn-rich tennantite (Fig.\u00a05d) and is hosted by quartz together with k\u00ebsterite (Fig.\u00a05e). Sphalerite and k\u00ebsterite are also included in pyrite. The Fe content in sphalerite is generally low (<0.10\u00a0wt%) corresponding to\u00a0<\u00a00.01\u20130.2\u00a0mol% Fe. Copper concentrations reach values of up to 3.37\u00a0wt% (Table 1), but these high values may be attributed to stannite-k\u00ebsterite sub-microscopic inclusions in sphalerite. In addition, concentrations of up to 1.09\u00a0wt% Cd, 1.80\u00a0wt% Sn, 0.38\u00a0wt% Mn, 1.38\u00a0wt% In, 0.32\u00a0wt%\u00a0Ga and 0.27\u00a0wt% Ge were also observed. The highest In concentrations occur in Fe-poor (0.01\u00a0wt%), as well as Cu- (3.37\u00a0wt%) and Sn-rich (1.80\u00a0wt%) sphalerite. In addition, SEM-EDS images and microanalyses indicate extreme enrichments of In in distinct growth zones reaching 6\u00a0wt%, and oscillatory zoning in sphalerite with In-rich zones alternating with In-poor zones that host galena inclusions (Fig.\u00a05d). The sphalerite analyzed here also contains zones with up to 4.6\u00a0wt% Sn and up to 6\u00a0wt% Cu (Fig.\u00a06\nd), attributed to nano-scale inclusions of Sn-Cu-bearing sulfosalts (e.g., Mn- and Zn-beraring analogs of mawsonite and stannoidite, and k\u00ebsterite), as no chalcopyrite disease could be observed in the analyzed grains. There is a positive correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.40) between Sn and Cu, and a weaker correlation between In versus Cu (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.11) and In versus Sn (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.10) (Fig. 6).\nThe Ge (up to 0.27\u00a0wt%) and Ga (up to 0.32\u00a0wt%) concentrations of sphalerite from St Philippos are consistent with those previously reported by Marschik et al. (2015), who gave maximum concentrations of 2156 and 1921\u00a0ppm for Ga and Ge, respectively. The Ge content is also comparable to that reported by Bernstein (1985) and Frenzel et al. (2014) of up to 3000\u00a0ppm for sphalerite and wurtzite elsewhere. There is no correlation between Ge and In in the studied sphalerite (Fig.\u00a06c).\nIn a plot of (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Mn) vs. (Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Ag) vs. (Sn\u00a0+\u00a0In) (Fig. 7\n), sphalerite from Pefka lies along or adjacent to the sphalerite-stannite tie line, but close to the (Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Mn) apex, whereas most of analyses from St Philippos are distributed along the sphalerite\u2013stannite tie-line (Fig. 7).\nWurtzite is a common mineral along with sphalerite in the St Philippos deposit, and occurs in veinlets and granular masses, which suggests it to be a late phase in the paragenetic sequence (Dimou, 1993; Skarpelis, 1999). Electron microprobe analyses of wurtzite by Driesner and Pintea (1994) revealed similar trace-element contents in wurtzite from St Philippos to those reported here for sphalerite, including up to 3.5\u00a0wt% In, up to 1.6\u00a0wt%\u00a0Ga and\u00a0<\u00a00.3\u00a0wt% Ge, while Hg, Sn, and Ag are generally below detection limits.\n\n\n4.2.1.3\nGalena (PbS) and galena\u2013clausthalite (PbSe) solid solution\nGalena at Pefka deposit was replaced by sphalerite, enargite, and roquesite, and is commonly intergrown with minerals of the bournonite-seligmannite series (Fig.\u00a04b). It was also replaced by altaite and tennantite-tetrahedrite. The Ag, Bi, and Sb content of galena is below detection limit and Te reaches values of up to 0.14\u00a0wt%. Galena contains up to 9.5\u00a0wt% Se with several analyses revealing intermediate compositions within the galena-clausthalite solid-solution series (ratio\u00a0~\u00a01:1) (Table 1). Galena is the main sulfide mineral in the St Philippos deposit. It formed late in the paragenetic sequence, where it occurs as hypidiomorphic crystals associated with jordanite and seligmanite, and where it rims Cu-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d and Zn-rich tennantite-(Fe). Galena also occurs as inclusions in k\u00ebsterite (Fig.\u00a05c) and is intergrown with tsumoite (Fig.\u00a05o).\n\n\n\n4.2.2\nSulfosalts\nPrevious studies reported extensively on the occurrence of enargite, luzonite, colusite, arsenosulvanite, watanabeite, Cu-excess tetrahedrite-tennantite and \u201cnormal\u201d, fully substituted by divalent elements, tetrahedrite-tennantite at the Pefka and St Philippos deposits (Voudouris, 2006; Repstock et al., 2015, 2016), and is only briefly discussed here. Instead, we focus on the discovery of \"tennantite-(In)\" in addition to new compositional data for goldfieldite and Te-bearing tetrahedrite-tennantite at Pefka, as well as on \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d, unnamed (Cu,Mn,Fe)8As3S9, and lautite at St Philippos. The nomenclature of the tetrahedrite-group minerals was based on the classification scheme introduced by Biagioni et al. (2020). Species not yet recognized by IMA are written with quotation marks (e.g. \u201ctennantite-Mn\u201d).\n\n4.2.2.1\nBismuthinite (Bi2S3) and stibnite(Sb2S3)\nAlthough bismuthinite was not identified at Pefka, it is abundant in the St Philippos mineralization, occurring as isolated grains within pyrite, or replaced by Fe-rich \"tennantite-(Mn)\" post-dating pyrite (Fig.\u00a05a). Up to 2.13\u00a0wt% Sb substitutes for Bi in the structure. Dimou (1993) reported that bismuthinite contains inclusions of cosalite (Pb2Bi2S5), kirkiite (Pb10Bi3As3S19), Bi-bearing jordanite (Pb14(Bi,As)6S23), and galena. Stibnite occurs at Pefka deposit in association with tellurantimony and chalcostibite during the telluride stage (Fig.\u00a04c).\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nRoquesite (CuInS2)\nAlthough the indium-bearing mineral roquesite was identified for the first time at Pefka by Voudouris et al. (2019), no quantitative data was obtained at that time. Roquesite, as anhedral grains up to 60\u00a0\u03bcm in size, is included in In-bearing tennantite (Figs 4b, 8) and also occurs as isolated grains in the quartz matrix of the quartz-enargite veins at Pefka. It incorporates tiny galena inclusions, as roquesite formed later than galena (Figs. 4, 8\n). Roquesite contains up to 0.32\u00a0wt% Zn and 0.1\u00a0wt% Sn (Table 2\n).\n\n\n4.2.2.3\nK\u00ebsterite [Cu2(Zn,Fe)SnS4], Mn-rich k\u00ebsterite [Cu2(Zn,Mn,Fe)SnS4], and stannite [Cu\u2082(Fe,Zn)SnS\u2084]\nK\u00ebsterite and Mn-rich k\u00ebsterite occur as inclusions in Fe-, Mn-, and Zn-rich varieties of tennantite at St Philippos (Fig.\u00a05b,c, f-h and k,l). K\u00ebsterite includes and is surrounded by sphalerite (Fig.\u00a05e), and is also intergrown with enargite and hosted by quartz. At St Philippos, stannite occurs in Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe). Intergrowths of stannite with k\u00ebsterite and Mn-rich k\u00ebsterite are rimmed by Zn-Mn-rich tennantite-(Fe) and Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d (Fig.\u00a05f). Mn-rich k\u00ebsterite contains up to 5.9\u00a0wt% Mn (Table 2). K\u00ebsterite at St Philippos contains up to 0.61\u00a0wt% In (this study) and is an additional host of In within the mineralization. Stannite is devoid of In and has almost a stoichiometric composition (Table 2). Stannite-k\u00ebsterite solid solution was not identified during this study at Pefka. The composition of stannite-k\u00ebsterite from St Philippos plot within the stannite, ferrok\u00ebsterite, and k\u00ebsterite fields (Figs.\u00a07,\u00a09a). In the studied samples, Mn substitutes for Zn in the structure as suggested by the negative correlation between them (Fig.\u00a09\nd). There is no correlation between In and Cu (Fig.\u00a09e) and In and Zn (Fig.\u00a09f).\n\n\n4.2.2.4\nUnnamed phases Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2(Mn,Zn)SnS4\n\nTwo previously unreported unnamed phases with the compositions Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2(Mn,Zn)SnS4, respectively, were identified at St Philippos. Compositions are shown in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 9. They are hosted by Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d in association with enargite and hessite (Fig.\u00a05i,j). It should be noted that the synthetic compound Cu2MnSnS4 is well known for its use as a semiconductor (Koo, 2012).\n\n\n4.2.2.5\nMohite (Cu2SnS3)\nMohite at St Philippos occurs as inclusions in k\u00ebsterite, in close association with stannite, which both typically form inclusions in Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe) (Fig.\u00a05k). Mohite has an almost stoichiometric composition (Table 2, Fig. 7). Previously mentioned stannite for Pefka deposit by Dimou et al. (1994), actually correspond to mohite (see Fig. 7).\n\n\n4.2.2.6\nMn-Zn analog of mawsonite [Cu6(Mn,Zn)2SnS8] - Zn-Mn analog of stannoidite [Cu+\n6Cu2+\n2(Zn2+,Mn)3Sn2S12]\nTwo phases with compositions of Cu6(Mn,Zn)2SnS8 and Cu8(Zn,Mn)3Sn2S12, which can be considered as Mn-Zn- and Zn-Mn analogs of mawsonite and stannoidite, respecetively, are reported here for the first time at St Philippos (Table 2, Fig. 7). They both occur as minor phases up to 10\u00a0\u03bcm in size included in Mn-k\u00ebsterite, k\u00ebsterite, Zn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe), and the unnamed phase (Cu,Mn,Fe)8As3S9 (Fig.\u00a05l). Mawsonite and stannoidite were also reported by Dimou et al. (1994) from Pefka where they occur as inclusions in goldfieldite, enargite, and luzonite; they were not detected during the present study.\n\n\n4.2.2.7\nColusite and arsenosulvanite\nColusite (ideally Cu24+xV2(As,Sb)6-x(Sn,Ge)xS32, x \u00a0=\u00a00 to 2) and arsenosulvanite (ideally Cu24+xV2(As,Sb)6-xS32, x\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a00 to 2) were reported by Dimou et al. (1994), Voudouris (2006), and Repstock et al. (2015) from the Pefka deposit. Microscopic observations made here suggest that colusite and arsenosulvanite formed with enargite, \u201carseno- and stibiogoldfieldite\u201d, and roquesite, forming part of the previously described HS assemblage at Pefka (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4.2.2.8\nEnargite\/luzonite\nAccording to Dimou et al. (1994), Voudouris (2006), and Repstock et al. (2015), enargite, luzonite, and famatinite at Pefka exhibit end-member compositions. This study verifies previous results and indicates that these minerals are spatially associated with colusite and watanabeite and are carriers of native gold (e.g., Liu et al. 2019). Enargite and luzonite were replaced by \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d, \u201ctetrahedrite-(Cu)\u201d, and Cu-rich varieties of tetrahedrite- and tennantite-(Fe) and -(Zn) including the newly named In-bearing variety of fahlores and \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d (see below) (Fig. 4). Enargite\/luzonite contains up to 0.20\u00a0wt% Se and 0.20\u00a0wt% Te. At St Philippos, enargite is spatially related to the Sn minerals. It appears as inclusions in quartz, where it accompanies k\u00ebsterite and pyrite (Fig.\u00a05b), and as inclusions in Cu- and Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d (Fig.\u00a05h, j).\n\n\n4.2.2.9\nIndium-bearing tennantite\nIndium-bearing tennantite rims roquesite and was replaced by tennantite-(Fe) (Figs. 4b, 8). It contains up to 6.5\u00a0wt% In and is therefore an important host for In at Pefka in addition to roquesite (Table 3\n). Both roquesite and In-bearing tennantite account for the extreme In enrichment (up to 675\u00a0g\/t) in Pefka ore. Fig. 10\n shows the negative correlation between In and (Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Fe), as well as with As (Fig.\u00a010e) (see discussion for substitution and charge balance). Indium-bearing tennantite contains an excess of Cu (>10 apfu) (Fig.\u00a010b) and is therefore a variant of the \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d that is part of the transitional HS-IS assemblage at Pefka (Repstock et al., 2015). It can be classified as In-rich \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d, or even Cu-Zn-rich \u201ctennantite-(In)\u201d (Table 3, analysis 4).\n\n\n4.2.2.10\n\u201cStibiogoldfieldite\u201d, \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d, and tellurium-bearing tetrahedrite\/tennantite\nTellurium-bearing tetrahedrite\/tennantite is spatially related to various tellurides (Fig. 4). Electron microprobe analyses revealed a range of compositions in Te-bearing varieties of tetrahedrite-tennantite (Table 3, Fig. 10), including \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d and \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d (e.g., Biagioni et al., 2020). Back-scattered electron images (Fig.\u00a04e-i) illustrate chemical zoning, the darker parts are As-rich and brighter parts are more Sb-rich.\n\n\n4.2.2.11\nManganese-bearing tennantite\n\nRepstock et al. (2016) identified tennantite at St Philippos, where it mostly occur as tennantite-(Zn) and tennantite-(Fe) varieties. All tennantite previously described was fully substituted by divalent elements, with no Cu-excess. Tennantite is the most abundant copper mineral at St Philippos where it surrounds pyrite (Fig.\u00a05a, c), sphalerite (Fig.\u00a05d), enargite, and Sn- phases (Fig.\u00a05c, f\u2013k) and also encloses tellurides (Fig.\u00a05i, j and l\u2013p). The compositions of tennantite are shown in Table 3, and in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 shows a negative correlation between Mn and (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Zn). Manganese, Fe, and Zn reach values of up to 5.42\u00a0wt%, 8.28\u00a0wt%, and 5.83\u00a0wt%, respectively. Based on the ratio of these three metals, tennantite from St Philippos is classified as Mn-rich, Mn-Zn-, Mn-Fe-rich, and according to the recently modified nomenclature, as Fe-, Cu-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d, Zn-Mn-, Zn-Cu-, Mn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe), and \u201cnormal\u201d tennantite-(Zn) and tennantite-(Fe) (e.g., Table 3). In addition, a Cd- and Cd-Mn-bearing and Cu-excess tetrahedrite (\u201ctetrahedrite-(Cu)\u201d) occurs as inclusions up to 10\u00a0\u03bcm in size within galena. It is devoid of Zn and Fe and contains up to 8.36\u00a0wt% Cd and up to 2.44\u00a0wt% Mn. Copper contents range from 10.34 to 10.94 apfu.\n\n\n4.2.2.12\nUnnamed (Cu,Mn,Fe)8As3S9, As-analog of skinnerite (Cu3AsS3), and lautite (CuAsS)\nThe unnamed (Cu,Mn,Fe)8As3S9 phase is included in Zn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe) at St Philippos (Fig.\u00a05l). It contains variable amounts of Fe, Zn, and Mn (Table 3). An As-analog of skinnerite (Cu3AsS3), also previously reported by Ondru\u0161 et al. (2003) at J\u00e1chymov ore district, Czech Republic, occurs at Pefka; it postdates enargite, colusite, and roquesite (Fig.\u00a04d). Lautite in association with hessite forms inclusions in Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d at St Philippos (Fig.\u00a05m). It is close to stoichiometric in composition (Table 3).\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nTellurides\nEleven tellurides (hessite, st\u00fctzite, petzite, sylvanite, calaverite, kostovite, altaite, coloradoite, empressite, tellurantimony, and tellurobismuthite) in addition to native tellurium occur at Pefka (Table 4, Figs 3, 4)\n. By contrast, the telluride mineralogy at St Philippos is less complex and only comprises hessite, altaite, and tsumoite (Table 4, Fig. 11). They occur in the following contact assemblages at Pefka: st\u00fctzite-altaite, hessite-altaite (Voudouris, 2006), hessite-tellurium, hessite-coloradoite (Dimou et al., 1994) and altaite-tellurium, coloradoite-tellurium, coloradoite-tellurantimony, hessite-tellurantimony, st\u00fctzite-coloradoite, kostovite-tellurobismuthite, and tellurobismuthite-tellurium (this study) (Fig. 4). Calaverite, petzite, and sylvanite occur as isolated grains. At St Philippos, hessite, altaite, and tsumoite occur as isolated grains or as multiphase inclusions in tennantite (Fig. 5). The compositions of the Au-Ag-tellurides and native tellurium are plotted in Fig. 11.\n\n4.2.3.1\nColoradoite (HgTe)\nColoradoite, the most common telluride in the Pefka deposit, is present as inclusions in tetrahedrite-group minerals, commonly occurring together with native tellurium (Fig.\u00a04m) and Ag-tellurides (empressite, hessite, and st\u00fctzite) (Fig.\u00a04k, l). It also occurs in the carbonate matrix of the quartz-carbonate veins (Voudouris, 2006). Representative electron microprobe analyses are given in Table 4\n. Coloradoite contains measurable Cu (up to 2.8\u00a0wt%) and Pd (up to 0.21\u00a0wt%) (Table 4).\n\n\n4.2.3.2\nAltaite (PbTe)\nAltaite is a very common telluride at the Pefka deposit, where it surrounds pyrite and sphalerite (Fig.\u00a04a) and occurs as inclusions in chalcopyrite and disseminated in the carbonate matrix. Altaite replaced minerals of the galena-clausthalite solid solution and is spatially associated with hessite (Fig.\u00a04l). Electron microprobe analyses demonstrate traces of Sb and Cu (Table 4). Altaite also contains up to 1.2\u00a0wt% Se at Pefka (Voudouris, 2006). In the St Philippos deposit, altaite either appears as single grains or it coexists with hessite as inclusions in Mn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe) (Fig. 5n). Electron microprobe analyses show a high concentration of Cu in altaite (up to 3.1\u00a0wt%) (Table 4).\n\n\n4.2.3.3\nTellurantimony (Sb2Te3)\nTellurantimony (Table 4) occurs as isolated grains within tennantite-tetrahedrite and chalcopyrite, and in association with other tellurides (e.g., hessite and coloradoite, Fig.\u00a04c,l).\n\n\n4.2.3.4\nEmpressite (AgTe)\nEmpressite occurs in contact with tellurantimony and coloradoite as an inclusion in tennantite-tetrahedrite-(Fe) (Fig.\u00a04k). Empressite, with exsolved native tellurium, is also associated with st\u00fctzite (Fig.\u00a04k). Electron microprobe analysis revealed a Ag-content of 38.27\u00a0wt% and Te-content of 46.6\u00a0wt%, corresponding to a metal:chalcogen ratio of 1:1 (Table 4; Fig. 11).\n\n\n4.2.3.5\nHessite (Ag2Te) and st\u00fctzite (Ag5-xTe3; x \u00a0=\u00a00.24 to 0.36)\nHessite and st\u00fctzite occur as inclusions within tetrahedrite-tennantite solid solutions, usually as intergrowths between hessite-tellurantimony-coloradoite, st\u00fctzite-coloradoite, and st\u00fctzite-coloradoite-tellurium-empressite (Fig.\u00a04k, l). At Pefka, hessite contains up to 1.8\u00a0wt% Cu while st\u00fctzite contains up to 2\u00a0wt% Cu (Fig. 11, Table 4). At St Philippos, hessite either occurs as single grains or it coexists with altaite in the form of inclusions in Fe-rich tennantite-(Mn), Zn-Cu-Mn-rich tennantite-(Fe), and tennantite-(Fe) (Fig. 5). A Cu-rich hessite in association with the unnamed phases Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2(Mn,Sn)S4 occurs as inclusions in Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d (Fig. 5i,j). Electron microprobe analyses show that hessite contains up to 2.5\u00a0wt% Cu (Table 4).\n\n\n4.2.3.6\nCalaverite (AuTe2), sylvanite (Au1+xAg1-xTe4; x \u00a0=\u00a00\u20130.4), and petzite (Ag3AuTe2)\nThe Au-Ag tellurides, calaverite, sylvanite, and petzite are reported here for the first time at the Pefka deposit (Table 4, Fig. 11), where they form inclusions up to 5\u00a0\u03bcm in size in \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d, \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d, and Te-bearing tetrahedrite\/tennantite (Fig.\u00a04f,h,j).\n\n\n4.2.3.7\nKostovite (CuAuTe4)\nKostovite at Pefka is spatially associated with tellurobismuthite and both are typically hosted by \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d (Fig.\u00a04i). This is only the second occurrence of kostovite in Greece with the first being identified at Panormos Bay, Tinos island (Tombros et al., 2007). Kostovite contains up to 3.2\u00a0wt% Ag (Table 4), which is comparable to Ag-bearing varieties described by Bonev et al. (2005).\n\n\n4.2.3.8\nTellurobismuthite (Bi2Te3) and tsumoite (BiTe)\nTellurobismuthite occurs as isolated grains included in \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d and \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d (Fig.\u00a04g,h). Tellurobismuthite in contact with kostovite is included in \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d and isolated in Te-Zn-rich \u201ctetrahedrite-(Cu)\u201d (Fig. 4i,j).\nTsumoite, associated with galena, is included in tennantite-(Fe) (Fig. 5o) at St Philippos (Table 4).\n\n\n\n4.2.4\nNative elements\n\n4.2.4.1\nNative gold (Au)\nNative gold at Pefka surrounds \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d and \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d (Fig.\u00a04n), occurs as single grains or in association with enargite and watanabeite in the quartz matrix, and as inclusions in the calcite matrix (Fig.\u00a04o). Assemblages of native gold with enargite, luzonite, and tetrahedrite\/tennantite were also previously described by Dimou et al. (1994) and Melfos et al. (2003). Electron microprobe data indicate that native gold at Pefka is almost chemically pure, with an Au content between 96 and 97\u00a0wt% (Fig. 11; Table 4). Minor impurities include Ag (up to 0.73\u00a0wt%), Cu (up to 0.18\u00a0wt%), Bi (up to 0.43\u00a0wt%), and Hg (up to 2.2\u00a0wt%). This is to our knowledge the first report of Hg-bearing gold in Greece. Mercury alloys easily with gold, and Hg-bearing gold and\/or electrum has already been reported in some porphyry-epithermal systems in Russia and Japan, such as the Tumanny Au-Ag-Te-Hg IS epithermal deposit, Russia (Baksheev et al., 2018), the Vorontsovskoe Au-Hg-As ore deposit (Northern Urals, Russia) (Murzin et al., 2017), and the Tsugu gold-antimony vein deposit in Japan (Shikazono and Shimizu, 1988).\n\n\n4.2.4.2\nNative tellurium (Te)\nNative tellurium is more common than native gold in the Pefka deposit where it occurs as isolated grains in quartz and carbonate matrix, and as inclusions in and as a replacement of \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d, \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d, tennantite\/tetrahedrite-(Zn) and -(Fe), and chalcopyrite (Fig.\u00a04f,g). At Pefka, native tellurium is spatially associated with hessite, empressite, coloradoite, altaite, and tellurobismuthite (Fig.\u00a04k,m).\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nBulk ore geochemistry\nBulk rock analyses of surface samples from both quartz and carbonate veins at Pefka indicate gold grades of 0.1 to 4.3\u00a0ppm (mean 1.2\u00a0ppm) (Table 5\n). The ore shows high concentrations of Cu, Pb, and As reaching\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0wt%, and\u00a0>\u00a02000\u00a0ppm Sb. Enrichments also occur in Bi (up to 346\u00a0ppm), Tl (up to 51\u00a0ppm), Hg (>50\u00a0ppm), Sn (up to 81\u00a0ppm), In (up to 675\u00a0ppm), Ga (up to 17\u00a0ppm), Ge (up to 16\u00a0ppm), Se (>100\u00a0ppm), and Te (>1000\u00a0ppm). Although several of the analyzed samples display both styles of mineralization due to overprinting relationship, the late carbonate-quartz veins contain lower amounts of Pb, As, Au, Bi, V, Tl, Se, Te, Ge, Sn, and In than the early quartz-enargite veins. This is due to incorporation of the above elements in the HS mineral assemblage at Pefka. Although Te is abundant due to the presence of tellurides in the late carbonate veins, it is also incorporated in \u201carseno- and stibiogoldfieldite\u201d, which is very abundant in the quartz-enargite veins, thus resulting in the extreme Te anomalies in quartz-enargite veins.\nBulk ore analyses from vein- and breccia-type massive sulfide mineralization at the St Philippos deposit, including both HS and IS stages, since it was not possible to separate the different assemblages, indicate (Table 6) high concentrations of Mo (up to 62\u00a0ppm), Ag (>100\u00a0ppm), Se (up to 48\u00a0ppm), Te (up to 43\u00a0ppm), U (up to 199\u00a0ppm), Sn (>100\u00a0ppm), Re (up to 45\u00a0ppb), Bi (>2000\u00a0ppm), Tl (up to 162\u00a0ppm), and Hg (up to 24\u00a0ppm). Enrichments in Ga (up to 290\u00a0ppm), In (up to 222\u00a0ppm), and Ge (>100\u00a0ppm) verify the earlier work of Driesner and Pintea (1994) and Skarpelis (1995, 1999).\nBulk ore correlation diagrams reveal positive correlations between Zn and In (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.79 vs 0.21), Ga and In (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.94 and 0.26), Ge and In (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.58 vs 0.60), Cd and In (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.90 vs 0.44), and Ge and Ga (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.61 vs 0.63) for St Philippos and Pefka deposits, respectively (Fig. 12\n). The strong positive correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.94) between In and Ga at St Philippos shows a Ga\/In ratio of almost 1 (Fig.\u00a012e), suggesting approximately equal amounts of both elements in the sphalerite structure.\nA positive correlation between Sn and In (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.38) for ore from St Philippos and a negative correlation between these elements (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.44) at Pefka, is due to their incorporation in k\u00ebsterite and sphalerite, which coexist in the St Philippos mineralization, and the presence of roquesite at Pefka, respectively (Fig.\u00a012c). There is no correlation between Sn and Au for ore at St Philippos, but there is a positive correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.53) between these elements at Pefka. Tellurium and Se show no correlation in the combined Pefka and St Philippos data sets, in which Pefka is characterized by much higher Te and Se contents than St Philippos (Fig.\u00a012i). Beyond this, the Zn\/In, Ga\/In, Ge\/In, and Cd\/In ratio of the mineralized samples is lower at Pefka than at St Phillipos. This probably could be related to variable abundances of sphalerite and Zn-rich members of the tetrahedrite-group minerals in these deposits.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nConstraints on critical metal incorporation at Pefka and St Philippos\nThis study demonstrates that critical and energy critical elements occur in various metallic minerals at the Pefka and St Philippos deposits. Major hosts for indium are roquesite, In-tennantite, and sphalerite at Pefka, and sphalerite (+wurtzite) and k\u00ebsterite at St Philippos. This enrichment is not uncommon for similar deposits elsewhere: the \u00c1nimas-Chocaya-Siete Suyos LS-IS polymetallic vein deposit, Bolivia contains sphalerite with up to 9.66\u00a0wt% In, stannite with up to 4.11\u00a0wt% In and wurtzite with up to 1.61\u00a0wt% In (Torr\u00f3 et al., 2019). The Poop\u00f3 LS-HS polymetallic epithermal deposit Bolivia contains sphalerite with up to 1.05\u00a0wt% In (+1,360\u00a0ppm\u00a0Ga), stannite with up to 1.01\u00a0wt% In, rhodostannite with up to 0.6\u00a0wt% In, teallite with 1.08\u00a0wt% In and cassiterite with up to 1.8\u00a0wt% In (+3,060\u00a0ppm\u00a0Ga) (Torres et al., 2019). Finally, the Mt. Carlton HS Au-Cu-Ag deposit, Australia, has sphalerite with up to 0.21\u00a0wt% In (+0.28\u00a0wt%\u00a0Ga and 0.06\u00a0wt% Ge), and significant content of Ge in enargite (up to 0.21\u00a0wt% Ge) (Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2017a, 2017b).\nAccording to George et al. (2017) and Biagioni et al. (2020), tetrahedrite-tennantite is generally a poor host for indium as In-bearing tetrahedrite-tennantite is rare but has been reported from VMS deposits in Portugal and Canada (Pinto et al., 1997; Gaspar, 2002; Serranti et al., 2002; Figueiredo et al., 2007; McClenaghan et al., 2009). At Neves-Corvo, Portugal, values of up to 2.7 and 0.2\u00a0wt% In occur in tennantite and tetrahedrite, respectively (Gaspar, 2002). Epithermal veins at the Capillitas deposit, Argentina, host In-bearing tennantite-(Zn) with up to 0.24\u00a0wt% In (M\u00e1rquez-Zaval\u00eda et al., 2020), while the Fukoku polymetallic vein-type deposit, Japan, hosts tetrahedrite-tennantite with up to 0.8\u00a0wt% In (Shimizu and Kato, 1991). However, In-rich tennantite at Pefka incorporates as much as 6.5\u00a0wt% In, a value far higher than that reported from any other deposits.\nIn the studied material, there is a marked negative correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.67) between indium and (Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) (Fig.\u00a010g), as well as with arsenic (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.49) (Fig.\u00a010e). Recalculations of apfu with totals for each site (e.g., according to the procedure of Biagioni et al., 2020) demonstrates that the D-sites are fully occupied by As3+ and Sb3+, and that no In enters in this site. Indium is trivalent and substitutes in the C-cite of the structural formula of Pefka tennantite, which is usually occupied by divalent cations (Zn2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, together with monovalent Cu+) (Biagioni et al., 2020). We suggest a coupled substitution of In3+ + Cu+ \u2194 for (Zn2+ + Fe2+) in the structure, which is favored by a decrease of As in tennantite. As stated by Cook and Ciobanu (2015), the potential significant role of tetrahedrite-group minerals as an indium carrier is poorly documented. Detailed crystallographic study is needed to confirm the exact site occupancy of indium in the structure of Pefka tennantite.\nSphalerite from Pefka contains up to 0.30\u00a0wt% In (mean value of 0.11\u00a0wt%) and can be also considered as an In carrier. On the other hand, sphalerite (and its polymorph wurtzite) at St Philippos is common and represents the major carrier for In (up to 1.4\u00a0wt% In with an outlier of 6\u00a0wt%; mean value 0.25\u00a0wt% In), as well as for Ga and Ge (up to 0.32\u00a0wt% and up to 0.27\u00a0wt%; mean values of 0.02 and 0.03\u00a0wt% respectively) in the mineralization (Fig. 6, Table 1).\nSphalerite generally contains In (Frenzel et al., 2016a) and, based on laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS), Cook et al. (2009a) and Ye et al. (2011) demonstrated lattice-bound In at concentrations across several orders of magnitude (from ppm to wt%) in sphalerite from various types of deposits. For example, zoned In-Cu-bearing sphalerite at the Toyoha deposit (Japan) contains up to 7.03\u00a0wt% In (Cook et al., 2009a; Shimizu and Morishita, 2012), which is comparable to the In content of sphalerite from the St Philippos deposit.\nIndium in sphalerite from the St Philippos deposit shows a weak correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.11) with Cu (Fig. 6a) suggesting the coupled substitution of In and Cu for Zn. This is in accordance with experimental studies of Schorr and Wagner (2005) in the system ZnS\u2013CuInS2, and indicates that indium is incorporated into the sphalerite structure via the coupled substitution (Cu++ In3+) \u2194 (Zn2+, Fe2+) (Cook et al., 2009a, 2012) or (In3++ Cu+)\u00a0\u2194\u00a02 Zn2+ (Shimizu and Morishita, 2012). According to Sahlstr\u00f6m et al. (2017b) and Frenzel et al. (2016a), the high Cu activity in hydrothermal fluids has a strong control on In enrichment and, to a lesser degree, on the Ga enrichment in sphalerite, allowing the extensive incorporation of these elements by coupled substitution with Cu (+Ag).\nAlthough there is a positive correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.40) between Cu and Sn in sphalerite from St Philippos (Fig.\u00a06d), it is not related to incorporation of Sn in the tetravalent site through the 2(Cu+,Ag+)\u00a0+\u00a0Sn4+\n\u2194 3Zn2+\nsubstitution, as proposed by Cook et al. (2009a). Most of Cu\/Sn ratios in analyzed sphalerite are \u226b2, and vary in the range from 4 to about 8. Such ratios may be attributed to sub-microscopic inclusions of Mn- and Zn-bearing analogs of mawsonite and\/or stannoidite in sphalerite. Only the highest Sn value (e.g., 4.6\u00a0wt% Sn; Fig.\u00a06d) with a Cu\/Sn ratio of 2.5 can be related to k\u00ebsterite and\/or stannite. According to Cook et al. (2009a), the Sn content in sphalerite is mostly low (<1000\u00a0ppm), with the exception of sphalerite from epithermal systems, where it reaches values of up to 1.17\u00a0wt% in the Toyoha Cu-Zn-In deposit, Japan, which are comparable to the Sn contents (0.05 to 1.80\u00a0wt%) of sphalerite from St Philippos.\n Thus, we propose that stannite inclusions are likely of minor importance with respect to the Sn budget of sphalerite in the Pefka and St Philippos deposits.\nK\u00ebsterite is another In-carrier in the St Philippos deposit. The concentrations of In in k\u00ebsterite from St Philippos (~0.5\u00a0wt%) are far below those reported from the Toyoha deposit (up to 1.86\u00a0wt% In; Ohta, 1989), but above values reported from cassiterite-quartz veins of the Pia Oak deposit (Vietnam, 0.1\u00a0wt% In) and from Sn-sulfide veins of the Kester deposit in Yakutia (up to 1500\u00a0ppm In) (Pavlova et al., 2015).\nThe critical metal Mn shows concentrations of up to wt% amounts in ore from the Pefka and St Philippos deposits, but is more enriched in the former than the latter (Tables 5 and 6). The host minerals for Mn at Pefka are unknown, since either the carbonate gangue, or the investigated minerals do not show exceptionally high Mn contents (usually\u00a0<\u00a00.2\u00a0wt%; e.g., sphalerite, tetrahedrite). At St Philippos, it seems that Mn is incorporated in several sulfosalts (e.g., Mn-k\u00ebsterite and unnamed Mn-analog to k\u00ebsterite-stannite) formed under HS conditions. The Mn-content of tennantite at St Philippos (up to 5.4\u00a0wt% Mn substituting for Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Zn in the lattice) is amongst the highest concentrations reported for this element in tennantite: Dobosi and Nagy (2000) reported 6.1\u00a0wt% Mn in fahlores from enargite-luzonite epithermal deposits from the Eastern M\u00e1tra Mountains, Hungary. Mn-bearing varieties of tennantite and tetrahedrite (up to 4\u00a0wt% and 1.8\u00a0wt%, respectively), were also reported from the epithermal Au-Ag deposits of the La Carolina district, in the San Luis metallogenetic belt (Argentina) (Gallard-Esquivel et al., 2018). Moreover, Mn-bearing tetrahedrite with up to 6.31\u00a0wt% Mn was also reported from the South Apuseni Mts, Romania, by Damian and Damian (2003). In common with all the above mentioned occurences, the Mn-bearing tennantite at St Philippos deposit was deposited during the IS stage that also prevailed during late crystallization of rhodochrosite in the deposit.\nTellurium is incorporated in the structure of various sulfosalts (e.g., \u201carseno- and stibiogoldfieldite\u201d), tellurides, and as native Te in both deposits, but it is extremely enriched in the Pefka compared to the St Philippos deposit, reaching Te concentrations (>1000\u00a0ppm) in the bulk ore (Table 5). This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of the three rare tellurides, empressite, telluroantimony, and kostovite at Pefka. Tellurantimony from this deposit is the first occurrence of this mineral in Greece. Afifi et al. (1988) suggested that tellurantimony is rare because of the preferred incorporation of Sb in the structure of other minerals like tetrahedrite-group minerals, tellurobismuthite, or nagy\u00e1gite (e.g., [Pb3(Pb,Sb)3S6](Au,Te)3). At Pefka, tellurantimony coexists with stibnite and tetrahedrite indicating the presence of Sb in the ore-bearing fluids during the IS stage, as opposed to As-rich fluid during earlier HS fluid conditions. It is suggested here that an excess in Sb with respect to the amount that can be hosted by other minerals like the sulfosalts, was probably the reason for the formation of tellurantimony at Pefka.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of empressite at Pefka is the third occurrence of that mineral in Greece; the other two being at Panormos Bay, Tinos island (Tombros et al., 2007, 2010) and the Skouries deposit (McFall et al., 2018). There are only few reported occurrences of empressite elsewhere in Europe (e.g., Norway (Cook, 1996), Sweden (Cook et al., 2007)). According to Afifi et al. (1988), empressite occurs in Au-poor hydrothermal veins and is formed by the decomposition of st\u00fctzite and native Te as the fluid cools. However, Plotinskaya at al. (2006) note that empressite is closely related to Au-Ag-tellurides, like sylvanite (AgAuTe4) in the epithermal Kochbulak and Kayragacha deposits (Uzbekistan). At Pefka, empressite formed later than native gold during precipitation from lower-temperature IS fluids, and coexists with other Ag-bearing tellurides (e.g., hessite, st\u00fctzite).\nAt Pefka, stanniferous germanite [Cu3(Ge,Fe,Sn)S4] occuring in the form of tiny inclusions in goldfieldite and colusite (Dimou et al., 1994), can be considered as a carrier of Ge in the HS stage. Enargite is a common Ge-bearing mineral in HS epithermal deposits (Liu et al., 2019). Some examples include La Mejicana, Argentina (Losada-Calder\u00f3n and McPhail, 1996) with up to 2679\u00a0ppm Ge, Mt. Carlton, Australia (Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2017a, 2017b), with up to 2189\u00a0ppm Ge, and Cerro Quema, Panama (Corral et al., 2016), with up to 1202\u00a0ppm Ge. However, this is not the case for the studied deposits, since enargite contain no Ge. The main carrier of Ge seems to be sphalerite at St Philippos, which forms at the same time as enargite according to the paragenetic sequence. We suggest that Ge is preferentially incorporated in sphalerite compared to enargite. The reason for this is unknown, however, processes, possibly related to differences in the Fe\/Zn ratio in sphalerite and the temperature of sphalerite formation, could have suppressed the incorporation of Ge into enargite, in favour of sphalerite. Similarly, Ge at Pefka deposit is incorporated in germanite, and probably all Ge was consumed by incorporation into this mineral and not into enargite.\n\n\n6.2\nPhysicochemical conditions of ore formation\nIn order to reconstruct the evolution of Pefka and St Philippos mineralization based on the paragenetic sequence (Fig. 3), to estimate the physicochemical conditions of ore formation (e.g., temperature, fS2, fO2, fTe2, pH, etc.), and to define the formation stage of the In-, Te-, Ge-, Sn-, and Au-rich phases, we use mineral indicators demonstrating that the systems may have cooled by\u00a0~\u00a0100 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C during their evolution. Both deposits consist of polymetallic mineralization, which evolved from high fluid temperatures (>300\u00a0\u00b0C to about 275\u00a0\u00b0C) at HS states towards lower temperatures (~250 to 150\u00a0\u00b0C at IS fluid states. Roquesite at Pefka is part of the early HS assemblage, since it occurs in the same paragenesis as enargite, colusite, and arsenosulvanite (Einaudi et al., 2003; Repstock et al., 2015). The presence of roquesite in HS mineralizations is rather uncommon, but has been also reported from the Martabe epithermal deposit, North Sumatra, Indonesia (Saing et al., 2016). Usually roquesite occurs in In-(Sn)-rich, relatively low-sulfidation (LS) to IS assemblages, or is exsolved from sphalerite, where saturation limits are exceeded (e.g.,\u00a0Cook et al., 2011a, 2011b; Jonsson et al., 2013, Cook and Ciobanu, 2015). In addition, previous studies of the Pefka deposit distinguished two associations of tennantite and tetrahedrite: an earlier Cu-excess Fe-rich and Zn-poor variety, which is associated with enargite and watanabeite that probably marks the transition from HS to IS fluid conditions, and a later Zn-rich, Fe-poor one, introduced during IS conditions and the formation of spatially associated Ag-Au tellurides (Voudouris, 2006; Repstock et al., 2015, 2016). However, the current study demonstrates that Zn-bearing varieties contain abundant inclusions of tellurides and native tellurium, in addition to identifying the presence of tellurides in normal fully substituted tetrahedrite-(Fe), tennantite-(Fe), and Cu-excess varieties such as Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d, Cu-rich tetrahedrite-(Zn), Te-bearing \u201ctetrahedrite-(Cu)\u201d, \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d, and \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d. Based on replacement textures between tellurides and the various tetrahedrite-group minerals, we suggest that the onset of a Te-rich fluid at Pefka took place at HS and transitional HS-IS fluid conditions, which subsequently continued during later deposition of normal, fully substituted tennantite- and tetrahedrite-(Zn) and -(Fe). These mineralogical observations are consistent with samples from St Philippos, where the tellurides hessite, altaite, and tsumoite occur as inclusions in both Cu-excess varieties of tennantite (i.e., Zn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe), Mn-Cu-rich tennantite-(Fe), and also in Fe-rich \u201ctennantite-(Mn)\u201d and tennantite-(Fe). Based on the available textural data we are unable to determine whether Au-bearing tellurides predate the formation of Ag-bearing tellurides, as is the case at the nearby Perama Hill deposit (Voudouris et al., 2011). However, the fluids at Pefka also became gradually more silver-rich during ore deposition, as reflected by the abundance of hessite, st\u00fctzite (and empressite) in the IS carbonate veins. Finally, Hg-bearing gold at Pefka is present in the transitional HS-IS assemblage and this contrasts to other occurences of this mineral, with usually characterizes intermediate to low fS2 conditions (Shikazono and Shimizu, 1988; Baksheev et al., 2018).\n\n6.2.1\nTemperatures during ore deposition\nIn the absence of fluid inclusion studies we have relied on phase relationships to determine temperatures of formation of the mineralization at both deposits. For the Pefka mineralization, high initial temperatures (>300\u00a0\u00b0C) can be assumed for the HS assemblage, based on the presence of goldfieldite, for which a formation temperature between 350 and 450\u00a0\u00b0C has been suggested based on experimental studies of the system Cu-Te-S (Karup-M\u00f8ller, 1994). Although goldfieldite may occur at shallow depths in epithermal systems (Kovalenker and Rusinov, 1986; Plotinskaya et al., 2005), it has been also reported in association with enargite, As-sulvanite, colusite, and Au-tellurides in the Assarel porphyry deposit, Bulgaria, as part of a deep HS style of mineralisation overprinting the system (Strashimirov et al., 2002), and at Butte, Montana, where an association with colusite and sericite indicates precipitation toward the end of the porphyry-style mineralization (e.g., Trudu and Knittel, 1998). Finally, the assemblage enargite-goldfieldite-pyrite at the Elshitsa epithermal Cu\u2013Au deposit, Southern Panagyurishte District, Bulgaria, was considered to have been formed at temperatures of 390\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C (Kouzmanov et al., 2004). Elshitsa is considered to be the deep part of a high-sulfidation epithermal system, genetically related to the adjacent Vlaykov Vruh porphyry Cu system (Kouzmanov et al., 2004).\nA temperature above 300\u00a0\u00b0C for the HS stage at Pefka is also compatible with precipitation of Cu-excess tennantite, as suggested for polymetallic veins at Morococha, Peru by Catchpole et al. (2012). This is in concordance with findings of the assemblage enargite-goldfieldite-native gold in the neighboring Perama Hill deposit, that formed during an initial HS and high-intermediate temperature (>300\u00b0 C) stage as supported by fluid-inclusion data (Voudouris et al., 2011), and from previous fluid-inclusion studies of similar HS and IS mineralization in the broad area (e.g. E-type veins at Pagoni Rachi and Sapes area) indicating enargite, telluride, and gold formation from intermediate-temperature fluids in the range from 250 to 320\u00a0\u00b0C, at low salinities (<5\u00a0wt% NaCl equiv.) (Voudouris, 2006; Ortelli et al., 2009; Voudouris et al., 2013), similar to those suggested here for ore deposition at the Pefka and St Philippos deposits.\nFor the St Philippos deposit, Dimou (1993) suggested that, based on experimental data in the system PbS-Bi2S2-As2S3 (Walia and Chang, 1973), the assemblage kirkiite\u2013Bi-bearing jordanite\u2013cosalite\u2013bismuthinite is stable at 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The presence of enargite during the HS mineralization stage at St Philippos also indicates initial temperatures\u00a0>\u00a0275\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C (P\u00f3sfai and Buseck, 1998), and the coexistence of enargite and luzonite at Pefka indicates a temperature drop below 275\u00a0\u00b0C (the inversion temperature of enargite to luzonite; Maske and Skinner, 1971). Both polymorphs could coexist metastably at temperatures between 200\u00b0 and 330\u00a0\u00b0C (Bernardini et al., 1973), as also observed in active fluid venting in Manus Back-Arc Basin (Dekov et al., 2016), and also for enargite-luzonite assemblages at Mt. Carlton, Australia and Cerro Quema, Panama, considered to be produced by low temperature fluids (average homogenization temperatures of\u00a0~\u00a0150 to 220\u00a0\u00b0C (Corral et al., 2017; Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2020). However we believe that our mineralization contrast to the above low temperature examples, with additional mineralogical evidence, for high formation temperatures during initial stages of ore deposition in the studied deposits, including: (a) the presence of APS minerals and pyrophyllite associated with pyrite at St Philippos indicating temperatures of about 300\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g. Watanabe and Hedenquist, 2001); (b) the presence of Se-bearing galena at Pefka, as incorporation of Se into the sulfide lattice is favored by higher formation temperatures (e.g., Huston et al., 1995); (c) the presence of Sn-bearing minerals, which according to Alderton and Brameld (2006) represent a higher temperature phase of mineralization within an epithermal environment and proximity to a magmatic source.\nThese data are consistent with fluid-inclusion studies of quartz by Kalogeropoulos and Katirtzoglou (1989) who showed that the HS stage at St Philippos formed at\u00a0~\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b0C and with \u03b418O data in quartz, using an experimentally determined oxygen isotope fractionation curve for the quartz-H2O pair from the HS mineralizing stage of both deposits, implying that the HS event continued until\u00a0~\u00a0275\u00a0\u00b0C (Michael et al., 1989a, 1989b). The high temperatures of ore formation during the initial HS stage at St Philippos are consistent with the In-enrichment in sphalerite, which is typically linked to relatively high-temperature fluids associated with granite intrusions (Cook and Ciobanu, 2015), whereas Ge- and Ga-enrichment in sphalerite is favored in lower-temperature deposits (Frenzel et al., 2016a). Although Shimizu and Morishita (2012) give a maximum temperature of 305\u00a0\u00b0C, based on fluid-inclusion data for the formation of In-bearing sphalerite in the Toyoha deposit, Japan, higher temperatures may have prevailed prior to sphalerite crystallization (Cook and Ciobanu, 2015).\nFurther cooling and ore deposition during the IS event of both deposits took place at temperatures of\u00a0<\u00a0230\u2013268\u00a0\u00b0C for St Philippos, as indicated by fluid-inclusion data for barite (Kalogeropoulos and Katirtzoglou, 1989), and up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C at Pefka. The latter temperature is considered to represent that associated with the formation of the Ag-tellurides empressite, st\u00fctzite, and hessite at Pefka. Such a temperature is also based on the data of Honea (1964), Afifi et al. (1988), and Bindi (2009). Similarly, empressite formed at temperatures\u00a0<\u00a0210\u00a0\u00b0C (Afifi et al., 1988; Bindi, 2009; Voronin et al., 2017). In addition, st\u00fctzite and hessite are considered to be the decomposition products of the \u03b3-phase (Ag2-xTe, where\u00a0x\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a00.08 to 0.12) at temperatures below 120\u00a0\u00b0C (Afifi et al., 1988).\n\n\n6.2.2\nSulfur, oxygen, and tellurium fluid fugacities\nBased on the temperature estimations for the Pefka and St Philippos deposits, the telluride and sulfide mineralogy, the composition of sphalerite coexisting with pyrite, and the available mineralogical data, the fO2, fS2 and fTe2 values for the hydrothermal solutions are constrained for both deposits (Fig.\u00a013\na\u2013d). Thermodynamic data for sulfides and tellurides used for calculating fTe2 and fS2 were derived from Mills (1974), Barton and Skinner (1979), and Afifi et al. (1988). Telluride stabilities were calculated for temperatures of 275\u00b0 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C, based on the temperature estimations during the Te mineralization stage (cf. section 6.2.1). We suggest that initial ore deposition from HS fluids at both deposits took place at about 280 to 320\u00a0\u00b0C at log fS2 in the range of \u22128 to \u22126 (Fig.\u00a013a), under which conditions enargite, pyrite, and Fe-poor sphalerite are stable in the HS stage (Fig. 3; Einaudi et al., 2003). Although the presence of Ge in the structure of sphalerite was suggested to represent low to moderate sulfur activity (Bernstein, 1985; H\u00f6ll et al., 2007), its incorporation in sphalerite at St Philippos (together with In and Ga) took place under high fS2 conditions.\n\u0391 subsequent path of decreasing fluid temperatures from about 280 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C is accompanied by a slight increase in the Fe content of sphalerite to about 3\u00a0mol% FeS at Pefka, which is indicative of decreasing fS2 and fO2 conditions as suggested for the IS relative to the HS stage (Scott and Barnes, 1971, 1972; Keith et al., 2014). This is also supported by the formation of tennantite\/tetrahedrite at log fS2 values of \u221214 to \u221211 and \u221212 to \u221210 at Pefka and St Philippos, respectively (arrows, Fig.\u00a013a).\n\nDimou (1993) and Skarpelis (1999) showed that wurtzite is stable at lower fS2 than sphalerite at St Philippos, which is in accordance with experiments of Scott and Barnes (1972) and indicates that wurtzite is stable at low fS2 (~10-20) and weakly acidic to moderately alkaline conditions (Fig.\u00a013a). We suggest that wurtzite is a late product at St Philippos, since sphalerite and wurtzite would not be expected to occur in the fS2 suggested for the HS and IS stage at Pefka and St Philippos (Fig.\u00a013a). However, the co-existence between wurtzite and sphalerite has been described in some hydrothermal ore deposits, as for example the Animas-Chocaya Mine, Bolivia, and the Merelani Hills, Tanzania (Pring et al., 2020).\nAt temperatures of 275\u00a0\u00b0C (enargite\/luzonite transition), the HS ore deposition at St Philippos took place under log fS2 values of \u22128.1 to \u22126, as indicated by the Fe content of sphalerite (<0.2\u00a0mol% FeS) and the presence of primary covellite in the ore (Fig.\u00a013b). During the HS stage at Pefka, log fS2 values vary between \u22127.9 and \u22127.6 at 275\u00a0\u00b0C, as suggested by the coexistence of enargite\/luzonite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite (Fig.\u00a013b). This is in accordance with decreasing log fS2 values during fluid cooling and evolution from HS to IS conditions. The upper limit of log fO2 values is defined by the galena\/anglesite phase transition for the St Philippos mineralization, and by the intersection of the pyrite\/hematite and enargite\/tennantite boundaries for the Pefka mineralization (Fig.\u00a013b). Estimated upper log fO2 values are \u221229.9 and \u221231 for St Philippos and Pefka, respectively. A lower limit of logfO2 values can only be approximated to a maximum total sulfur value of 0.01 considered to be characteristic for HS-IS epithermal deposits (Heald et al., 1987). Taking into consideration the presence of kaolinite and sericite in the vein assemblages at St Philippos and Pefka, we consider lower log fO2 limits of about \u221230.5 and \u201332.5 for St Philippos and Pefka, respectively (Fig.\u00a013b).\nThe presence of tellurium-bearing phases (e.g., goldfieldite, hessite) during the enargite-bearing HS stage, as well as in the HS-IS transition in both deposits, suggests that initial telluride mineralization occurred at log fTe2 values above \u221210.5; the hessite-(Ag2Te) \u2013 argentite (Ag2S) reaction (Fig.\u00a013c; T\u00a0=\u00a0275\u00a0\u00b0C). The lower limit of log fTe2 limit during the early HS stage at Pefka is unknown, however, it must be higher than that at St Philippos (i.e. log fTe2\u00a0>\u00a0-10), because of the high abundance of tellurium-bearing minerals in the Pefka mineralization. An upper limit of telluride deposition at both deposits at initial HS fluid states and high temperatures (e.g., 275\u00a0\u00b0C) could be the native gold\/calaverite boundary at \u22128.5 log fTe2 because of the absence of calaverite and presence of native gold in the HS assemblages. The telluride deposition continued under increasing log fTe2 values reaching up to \u22127.1 during the IS stage and was leading to the precipitation of tellurobismuthite and native tellurium at Pefka, as well as altaite and galena at St Philippos, which lies within the stability field of tennantite-tetrahedrite (Fig.\u00a013c).\nHowever, the bulk of telluride deposition at Pefka could have also occurred when temperatures decreased to 200\u00a0\u00b0C at log fS2 values between \u221214.5 and \u221213.7, as indicated by the widespread co-occurrence of tennantite\/tetrahedrite and sphalerite with higher Fe contents (1.0 \u2013 2.6\u00a0mol% FeS). The telluride deposition took place mainly at log fTe2 values close to the galena-altaite and stibnite-tellurantimony boundaries with maximum log fTe2 values defined by the condensation of native tellurium at about \u22129.5 and with a lower limit at about \u221211.2, as reflected by the \u03b3-phase\/hessite boundary (Fig.\u00a013d). These results are also in accordance with the presence of coloradoite (HgTe) within the mineralization (Fig.\u00a013d). It can be concluded that telluride deposition in both deposits spans the whole range from HS to IS fluid conditions, in the temperature range from\u00a0>\u00a0275\u00b0 to about 200\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n6.3\nSource of metals and metalloids\nThe mineralization at Pefka and St Philippos display common evolutionary paths from HS to IS fluid states, but a distinct metal endowment at the deposit-scale, as well as between the HS and IS assemblages (Fig. 3). This includes, for example, a subordinate HS event at St Philippos as reflected by higher abundance of enargite in the latter, which is strongly overprinted by an IS tennantite-galena mineralization (Fig. 3). In general, the St Philippos deposit is more enriched in Pb, Zn, Bi, U, Mo, Sn, Ga, and Ge than Pefka, which in comparison, contains more As, Cu, Sb, Au, Te, Se and In (Fig. 12,\nTables 5,6). At Pefka, the late IS carbonate-quartz veins generally contain less Pb, As, Au, Bi, V, Tl, Se, Te, Ge, Sn, and In than the early HS quartz-enargite\/luzonite veins (Fig. 12, Tables 5 and 6), suggesting a more efficient precipitation process at HS conditions. Although Te is abundant in the form of tellurides in the late IS carbonate veins at Pefka, an unusual enrichment is also observed in the HS quartz-enargite veins due to the presence of \u201carseno- and stibiogoldfieldite\u201d. This enrichment is uncommon because most recent studies suggest that Te-rich mineralizations are related to neutral to alkaline pH, moderately reduced and lower temperature fluids typically reflecting IS to LS conditions (Spry et al., 1997; Cooke and McPhail, 2001; Pals and Spry, 2003; Ciobanu et al., 2004; Grundler et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2017; Keith et al., 2018, 2020; Chang et al., 2020). At St Philippos, based on mineral assemblages (e.g., k\u00ebsterite-sphalerite-bismuthinite) and the demonstrated correlation trends between various elements in the bulk ore diagrams (Fig. 12), it would appear that Sn, Bi, In (and probably also Mo and U) were introduced during the HS event, as also appears to be the case at Pefka. Germanium and Ga at St Philippos are structurally bound within sphalerite and were introduced at HS conditions together with In, but also in the structure of wurtzite (Driesner and Pintea, 1994; Skarpelis, 1995, 1999).\nThe distinct metal associations for the studied deposits may partly be controlled by the distinct fluid evolution, the role of different ore-hosting rocks (sediments and rhyolites at St Philippos, compared to andesites and rhyolites at Pefka), their position with respect to the causative porphyry center, and different metal-deposition mechanisms, as for example fluid mixing, boiling, cooling, and fluid-rock interaction (Kouzmanov and Pokrovski, 2012). The above mechanisms account for the observed metal zonation in many porphyry districts around the world, resulting in the formation of Cu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Au\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Mo ore shells, centered on the porphyry stock, and to an outward base metal zoning consisting of Cu-Zn, Zn-Pb-Ag, Pb-Ag, and As-Sb-Hg-Au zones, in order of increasing distance from the porphyry center (Kouzmanov and Pokrovski, 2012). Ore deposition in HS deposits is the result of various mechanisms including mixing of hot magmatic fluid with cooler meteoric water (Heinrich, 2005), boiling (Ruggieri et al., 1997), and combined boiling and mixing (Pudack et al., 2009). However, in the absence of stable isotope and fluid-inclusion data the role of any of the above mentioned processes to the metal distribution and precipitation in the studied deposits cannot be evaluated. The presence of platy calcite at Pefka suggests the ore-forming fluids boiled at least during the IS stage (e.g., Simmons and Browne, 2001; Simmons et al., 2005); strong evidence for this occurs at higher elevation in the deposit, and most of the veins containing platy calcite are poorly mineralized. Fluid boiling could also be a possible depositional mechanism at St Philippos, since hydrofracturing and decompression accompanied by phase separation likely caused the brecciated nature of the ore in the deposit. In addition to phase separation, fluid mixing may have also played a role in ore deposition, especially at St Philippos, where abundant barite probably formed as a result of mixing between magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and seawater (based on sulfur-isotope data in barite from Marschik et al., 2015).\nThe metal endowment in both deposits was likely controlled by the magma compositions, as both deposits are hosted and genetically related to different magmatic rocks, as reflected by rhyolitic host rocks at St Philippos compared to andesitic compositions at Pefka. Based on sulfur isotope data of sphalerite and galena (\u03b434S values range from about 0 to 5 and from 2 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a04 per mil, respectively), Marschik et al (2015) demonstrated that In, Ga, or Ge in the St Philippos deposit were derived from a magmatic granitic source by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The same may be true for Pefka, as it is common that HS deposits are usually genetically related to their igneous host rocks, since the ore-forming components are derived from a magmatic fluid as the magma crystallized (e.g., Arribas, 1995; Hedenquist et al., 2000).\nThe metal endowment of granitoid-related deposits is controlled by several factors including the magma oxidation state and degree of fractionation (e.g.\u00a0Blevin and Chappell, 1995; Thompson et al., 1999; Blevin, 2002, 2004;\u00a0Baker et al., 2005), with porphyry Cu-Au deposits mostly related to oxidized and intermediate magma compositions (i.e., magnetite series) and Sn-W-Mo porphyry deposits mostly related to reduced and felsic magma compositions (i.e., ilmenite series). Fig. 14\n shows the oxidation state and fractionation degree of rhyolitic and andesitic-dacitic magmas, which are considered to be genetically related to the St Philippos and Pefka deposits, respectively. Both groups of magmatic rocks plot in the magnetite series and in the field of Cu-Au and Cu-Mo-(W) porphyry deposits (Fig. 14). Quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes from St Philippos and rhyolitic pyroclastics overlying the deposit at Pefka show higher Rb\/Sr than the andesites at Pefka, in accordance with higher degrees of fractionation (Arikas and Voudouris, 1998). Rhyolitic magmas in the area are strongly oxidized and plot above the ilmenite\/magnetite line (Fig. 14). The high oxidation state of the rhyolitic magmas, which hosts In-rich sphalerite and k\u00ebsterite at St Philippos, resembles that of magnetite-series, felsic magma compositions which are associated with Sn-In-Cu-bearing IS to LS polymetallic deposits such as Toyoha and Ashio in Japan (e.g., Ishihara et al., 2006). According to Murakami and Ishihara (2013), indium enrichment requires S-rich oxidized magmatism. The oxidized nature of Oligocene magmas in the area studied here was also verified by Schaarschmidt et al. (2021a, 2021b), who showed that Sr- and Nd-isotope data from felsic magmas indicate minor crustal assimilation, and that these were generated by fractional crystallization of mantle-derived, mafic, shoshonitic to calc-alkaline magmas.\nOur data suggest that there is no evidence for the genetic relation of the St Philippos mineralization to reduced, felsic magmas with high Rb\/Sr, which typically produce porphyry W-Mo or porphyry Sn deposits (Fig. 14; Baker et al., 2005). The mineralization at St Philippos shows an enrichment in Pb, Zn and Cu, as well as, incompatible elements including Sn, Bi, Ag, U, In, Ga, and Ge, and can be regarded as a Pb-Zn-Cu-rich polymetallic (HS)-IS lode system peripheral to a magnetite series granite porphyry Cu-Mo deposit buried at depth. A potential similar microgranite-hosted Cu-Mo-Re porphyry-style mineralization is exposed at Maronia some km further to the south (Melfos et al., 2002; Schaarschmidt et al., 2021a, 2021b), which is overprinted by Pb-Zn-Bi polymetallic mineralization similar to that of St Philippos. We propose that oxidized felsic magmas capable of generating Cu-Mo-Re mineralization, maybe inherit a Sn signature due to some contamination in the crust, thus producing distal Pb-Zn-Cu-Sn-In polymetallic lodes such as at St Philippos. In general, felsic melts are poor in many metals and metalloids, particularly the chalcophile elements like Cu, Au, Te, and Se, probably related to high partition coefficients in favor of the exsolving magmatic fluid phase for some of these elements at very specific conditions (e.g., Kiseeva and Wood, 2013).\nIn contrast, the andesitic magmas associated with Pefka are the host rocks of Cu-Au rich HS-IS veins, which may have formed above oxidized granodiorite stocks hosting porphyry Cu-Au mineralization (Fig. 14). The composition of Pefka samples partly overlap with the field of the Au-Bi-Te-rich intrusion-related deposits (Fig. 14), which is reflected in the enrichment of these elements in the mineralization at Pefka.\nThe ore-forming processes at Pefka and St Philippos deposits are shown schematically in Fig. 15\n. Emplacement of granodiorite and microgranite (e.g., quartz-feldspar) porphyry intrusions within coeval volcanic rocks at Pefka and conglomerates-sandstones at St Philippos was followed by the development of early porphyry-type mineralization at depth and the probable formation of a now-eroded advanced argillic alteration lithocap. Continuous degassing of both magmas, boiling due to hydrofracturing and\/or mixing with meteoric\/seawater fluids resulted in the deposition of critical and precious metals in pyrophyllite-kaolinite-APS minerals bearing breccias at St Philippos and in quartz-sericite and carbonate-quartz veins at Pefka, from HS and IS fluids. The presence of pyrophyllite at St Philippos, in association with enargite, suggest a deep- to intermediate depth of formation within the epithermal environment (Sillitoe, 1999; Hedenquist et al., 2000; Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003). Similarly, at Pefka a deep and\/or distal (in respect to the causative intrusion) setting of exposure can also be assumed due to the lack of advanced argillic alteration and the presence of sericite (e.g. muscovite) alteration accompanying the enargite lode mineralization.\nThe metal endowment in both deposits correlates with different magma compositions that are: andesitic compositions associated with Cu-Au-Te-Se rich mineralization at Pefka, compared to more differentiated felsic compositions at St Philippos that are related to Pb-Zn-Ga-Ge-In-Sn-U rich ores, but also with evolution from HS to IS within each deposit, and probably at some distance from the causative porphyry center. Given the presence of rhyolitic volcanics overlying the andesites at Pefka (Figs. 1 and 15), a possible contribution from rhyolitic magmatism could explain the relatively high In-content of the ore.\nUnder the highly initial oxidized conditions, such as those suggested for the studied mineralization, Te and Au were probably carried by oxidized magmatic fluids (Grundler et al., 2013). As suggested above, there is geological evidence for boiling at Pefka at least during the IS stage, and phase separation and preferential Te partitioning into the vapor could lead to the formation of abundant tellurides in this deposit (e.g., Cooke and McPhail, 2001). Boiling processes were probably more effective at Pefka than at St Philippos, and would also lead to its extreme Te enrichment.\n\n\n6.4\nComparison with similar mineralization elsewhere\nWithin the epithermal family of deposits, those from the Bolivian Sn-Ag belt, as for example the \u00c1nimas-Chocaya-Siete Suyos LS-IS polymetallic vein deposit (Torr\u00f3 et al., 2019) and the Poop\u00f3 LS-HS polymetallic epithermal deposit (Torres et al., 2019), contain various Sn minerals and feature an In-Ga-Ge enrichment, but without any tellurides. On the contrary, the Mt. Carlton HS-IS Au-Cu-Ag deposit, Australia, is characterized by several Ge-, Ga-, In-, and Te-bearing phases, but lacks Sn-bearing minerals (Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2020). The presence of Sn-bearing minerals and tellurides at the Pefka and St Philippos deposits, is uncommon and was previously reported only from the Srednogorie zone in Bulgaria, the Russian Far East and Japan, at for example the Elshitsa HS-IS Cu-Au-Te epithermal deposit, Southern Panagyurishte District, Bulgaria (Kouzmanov et al., 2004), the HS-IS Te- and Se-bearing epithermal Prasolovskoye deposit, Kuril Islands, Russia (So et al., 1995), the Suttsu vein-type deposit, Japan (Ono et al., 2004), and the Svetloye gold prospect, Russia (Alderton and Brameld, 2006; Yakich et al., 2021). However, there are only fewer deposits in the world characterized by the coexistence of Sn-, In-, and Te-bearing minerals, as reported at Pefka and St Philippos. These are the Capillitas deposit, Argentina, the Kawazu deposit, Japan, and the Radka IS-HS epithermal Cu-Au deposit in the Panagyurishte ore district, Bulgaria. In contrast to that at Pefka and St Philippos, Te-, In-, and Sn-bearing minerals at Capillitas, Kawazu, and Radka are paragenetically related and occur together in the same IS assemblage (Bogdanov et al., 2004; Shimizu et al., 2008; M\u00e1rquez-Zaval\u00eda et al., 2020).\nIn this regard, the metallic assemblages in the Pefka and St Philippos are unique in that critical metal (and metalloid) deposition took place throughout the HS to IS stages. Another rarity of the St Philippos deposit is the unusual high concentrations of all three metals (i.e., In, Ga, and Ge) in sphalerite, which is at odds with previous ideas that indium is enriched at high temperatures in magmatic-hydrothermal deposits, whereas Ga and Ge are generally associated with low-temperature deposits (e.g.,\u00a0Frenzel et al., 2016a, 2016b). However, Breiter et al. (2013) demonstrated enrichment of Ge and Ga during the fractional crystallization of igneous rocks. The enrichment in Ga, Ge, or In has also been reported from the IS epithermal Au-Ag deposits of the La Carolina district, Argentina (Gallard-Esquivel et al., 2018), and the IS-stage assemblage of the Mt Carlton HS-IS epithermal deposit, Australia (In and Ga in sphalerite: up to 2169\u00a0ppm and up to 2829\u00a0ppm, respectively; Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2017a, 2017b), and in veins from the IS deposit at Rosia Montana, Romania (Cook et al., 2009a).\nPefka and St Philippos deposits are the highest grade Te-In and Ga-Ge-In polymetallic vein deposits in Greece (Melfos and Voudouris, 2012; this study). The identification of this metal assemblage in these two deposits in northern Greece suggests that this area may be a key location for future exploration of critical metal resources in Europe.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe Pefka and St Philippos polymetallic vein- and breccia-type deposits evolved from early high-temperature (>300\u00a0\u00b0C) HS fluids, towards lower-temperature (200\u2013250\u00a0\u00b0C) IS fluids. Both deposits are characterized by extreme enrichment in various critical and base metal(loid)s including Au, Ag, In, Ga, Ge, Te, Se, Bi, and Sn, which occur in HS and IS mineral assemblages.\nIndium occurs in sphalerite and k\u00ebsterite at St Philippos (grades of up to 222\u00a0ppm), and roquesite, \u201ctennantite-(Cu)\u201d and \u201ctennantite-(In)\u201d at Pefka (grades of up to 700\u00a0ppm). Indium was introduced during the HS event in both deposits, together with Sn-bearing minerals and in close association with enargite\/luzonite. Tellurium-bearing minerals are present in both deposits, where they form part of both the HS and IS mineral assemblages. Tellurides are common in the Pefka deposit with early Te-enrichment also found in the structure of \u201cstibiogoldfieldite\u201d and \u201carsenogoldfieldite\u201d, and as inclusions in Au-Ag-tellurides within Te-bearing tetrahedrite-tennantite.\nEnrichment of incompatible elements in the St Philippos deposit includes Bi (>2000\u00a0ppm), Sn (>100\u00a0ppm), U (up to 200\u00a0ppm), Pb (>1\u00a0wt%), Zn (>1\u00a0wt%), Mo (up to 62\u00a0ppm), Ge (>100\u00a0ppm), Ga (up to 466\u00a0ppm), and In (up to 222\u00a0ppm), and suggests a felsic source (e.g., quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes) for these metals. The metal endowment at St Philippos contrasts to that at Pefka, which is mostly enriched in Cu (>1 wt%), Au (up to 5 ppm), In (up to 700 ppm), Te (>1000 ppm), and Se (>100 ppm), and is genetically related to both andesitic and rhyolitic magmas. The magmas related to both deposits show mainly oxidized compositions, that do not resemble typical reduced Sn-W and Au-Bi deposits.\nThere are only few other polymetallic deposits in the world (Capillitas, Radka, and Kawazu) with similar Sn-Te-In-(Ge-Ga)-element associations that formed in areas with arc magmatism.\n\n","67":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe three major giant metallogenic domains worldwide are the Circumpacific Metallogenic Domain, the Central Asia-Tianshan Metallogenic Domain, and the Tethys-Himalaya Metallogenic Domain. The North Himalayan Metallogenic Belt (NHMB) is a significant component of the Tethys-Himalaya Metallogenic Domain, located within the most representative orogenic belt worldwide-the Himalayan Orogenic System. A series of Sb, Au, Sb\u2013Au, Pb\u2013Zn(Ag), Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag, and W\u2013Sn(Be) deposits and ore occurrences have been generated by three main mineralization events within the NHMB (Fig. 1\n; Zheng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2021): (1) the first mineralization event is related to multiple seafloor volcanic events during the Syn-Sedimentary Period [220 \u2013 130\u00a0Ma; e.g., the first episode of mineralization (Pb\u2013Zn mineralization) in the Zhaxikang Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag deposit], (2) the second mineralization event is associated with a metamorphic fluid system during the Syn-Collision Period (60 \u2013 42\u00a0Ma) of the India and Eurasia Plates that formed several orogenic Au\u2013Sb deposits (e.g., the Nianzha and Bangbu Au deposits), (3) the third mineralization event relates to the magmatic-hydrothermal activity during the Post-Collision Period (25 \u2013 9\u00a0Ma) and has developed some W\u2013Sn(Be) and Sb deposits [e.g., the Cuonadong W\u2013Sn(Be) and Shalagang Sb deposits]. The substantial metallogenic potential, complex tectonic and metallogenic history have attracted extensive interest from the international community, and multiple research efforts have been conducted (e.g., Yang et al., 2009; Duan et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017, 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2020; Cao et al., 2021). However, the metallogenic mechanism remains unclear and debated, severely restricting the prospecting breakthroughs within the NHMB.\nThe Zhaxikang Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag deposit contains Zn\u00a0+\u00a0Pb 2.066 Mt at an average grade of 6.38%, Sb 0.235 Mt at an average grade of 1.14%, Ag 2660.6\u00a0t at an average grade of 101.64\u00a0g\/t, Au 14.36\u00a0t at an average grade of 2.9\u00a0g\/t, associated Ga 361\u00a0t, and 20 Mt Mn\u2013Fe carbonate ores at an average grade of 42% for Fe\u00a0+\u00a0Mn, and has been the only super-large deposit identified within the NHMB until now (Wang et al., 2020). The nearby Keyue Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag deposit is a medium-sized deposit (Fig. 1B) that has a reserve of 252400\u00a0t Pb with an average grade of 3.00%, 215500\u00a0t Zn with an average grade of 2.44%, 97600\u00a0t Sb with an average grade of 1.15%, and 757.1\u00a0t Ag with an average of 100.72\u00a0g\/t (Tibetan Huayu Mining Co. LTD: latest exploration results). These two deposits, separated only by a regional NS-trending normal fault with strike-slip properties, have similar ore-forming elements and mineral associations, ore characteristics, ore paragenetic sequence, wall rocks, and H\u2013O\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopic and fluid inclusion characteristics (Zheng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018b). Our short review above suggests that a genetic relationship must exist between the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits. This influential finding suggests that the combined research between these two most representative deposits within the NHMB is conducive to pinpointing the regional metallogenic mechanism.\nFor decades, with the efforts of analytical chemists, the analytical routines of the multiple collectors inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) have been substantially improved. This improvement has led to significant advances in relatively new techniques of metal stable isotopes to trace metal sources and migration (e.g., Fe, Cu and Zn; Mar\u00e9chal et al., 1999; Zhu et al., 2002; Wilkinson et al., 2005; Mathur et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2013). In ore deposit research, metal stable isotopes are superior to traditional C\u2013H\u2013O\u2013S isotopes when is used to trace metal sources and monitor ore formation. The reason is that they are ore-forming elements and relevant information is derived directly from the ore minerals themselves (Wang and Zhu, 2010, 2012). Extreme enrichment of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) in Pb\u2013Zn deposits makes their isotopes becoming ideal for investigating ore-forming fluid evolution, ore formation, and ore genesis. Additionally, the advantage of using Zn\u2013Cd isotopes is that the Zn\u2013Cd isotopic fractionation is not affected by the redox reaction during sulfide precipitation, because the redox state for Zn\u2013Cd is\u00a0+\u00a02, not only in ore-forming hydrothermal fluids but also in sulfides. Typical examples are as follows. Zhu et al. (2017) have studied the Cd characteristics of the Fule Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit in China and found that the \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values and Cd\/Zn ratios of light sphalerite (\u03b4\n114\/110Cd: 0.32\u2030 \u2013 0.59\u2030), dark sphalerite (\u03b4\n114\/110Cd values: \u20130.05\u2030 to 0.35\u2030, Cd\/Zn ratios: 250 \u2013 590), and layered smithsonite (\u03b4\n114\/110Cd: 0.08\u2030 \u2013 0.31\u2030) all exhibited a spatially increasing trend, which can be explained by kinetic Rayleigh fractionation; however, the regression lines of \u03b434S vs Cd\/Zn ratios are quite different between light and dark sphalerite, which is regarded as the result of two-component fluid mixing. Gao et al. (2018) have measured the Fe\u2013Zn\u2013Pb isotopes of sulfides from the main orebody in the Dongshengmiao SEDEX deposit in Inner Mongolia and found that the lateral increase in \u03b466Zn\u2013\u03b456Fe values and homogeneous Pb isotopic compositions indicated that the hydrothermal system evolved from southwest to northeast within the orefield.\nFor the NHMB, several studies have used the advanced metal stable isotopic approaches. Wang et al. (2017), Wang et al. (2018a) confirmed the existence of two episodes of mineralization in the Zhaxikang deposit by temporally increasing \u03b456Fe and decreasing \u03b466Zn values coinciding with an increase in alteration. Based on theoretical calculations and geological evidence, the \u03b456FeIRMM-014 and \u03b466ZnAA-ETH values of the first episode of ore-forming fluid were evaluated as \u20130.5\u2030 to \u20131\u2030 and \u20130.28\u2030 to 0\u2030, respectively. These Fe\u2013Zn isotopic compositions were only found in the seafloor hydrothermal fluid system. Concurrently, the low Cd concentrations (1183 \u2013 2199\u00a0ppm), correspondingly high Zn\/Cd ratios (248 \u2013 421), and large Cd isotopic variation range with relatively lower \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values (\u20130.51\u2030 to 1.01\u2030) of sphalerite in the Zhaxikang deposit are also only consistent with the sedimentary exhalative system (Wen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). The above evidence has solved the genetic controversy for the Zhaxikang deposit and verified the SEDEX overprinted by the hydrothermal fluid genetic model. By comparison, a related investigation of metal stable isotopes in the Keyue deposit has not been conducted. Based on the aforementioned research foundation, we conducted a Zn\u2013Cd isotopic study of sulfides in the Keyue deposit to compare it with that of the Zhaxikang deposit and constrain the genetic relationship between these two deposits. This pioneering work contributes to further metallogenic theoretical research and prospecting exploration practice within the NHMB, and provides a new research strategy for other ore deposits.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nUsing four nearly EW-trending faults [the South Tibet Detachment System (STDS), the Main Central Thrust (MCT), the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT); Fig. 1A; Spratt et al., 2005; Yin, 2006] as the boundaries, the Himalayan Terrane is divided into four sub-tectonic belts from north to south: the North Himalayan Tethys Sedimentary Fold Belt (the North Himalayan Tectonic Belt; NH), the High Himalayan Crystalline Rock Belt (HH), the Low Himalayan Fold Belt (LH), and the Sub-Himalayan Tectonic Belt (SH; Fig. 1A; Harrison et al., 1992; Murphy et al., 2002). The NHMB, located in the eastern section of the NH, is dominated by a set of Paleozoic marine sedimentary sequences formed in a passive continental margin environment within northern India (Fig. 1A; Yu and Wang, 1990).\nWithin the NHMB, the regional sedimentary strata cropped out in an EW-NWW trend and the outcropped strata mainly include the Proterozoic metamorphic rocks (Precambrian Laguigangri Group: schist, gneiss and migmatite units) and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks (Qudegong Group: muscovite-biotite schist, garnet phyllonite, granulite, griotte and amphibolite) that are in the core of the Yelaxiangbo Dome; a series of Ordovician, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous sedimentary rocks; and Quaternary sediments (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, there are stratigraphic gaps for the Sinian, Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian and Tertiary. There are relatively few Precambrian and Paleozoic strata, and the Mesozoic strata are widely distributed over an area of more than 90%. The dominant regional ore-bearing rock series is a set of Late Triassic-Early Cretaceous flysch formations formed by turbidity sediments and a hydrothermal sedimentation carbonaceous-siliceous-argillaceous rock series (weak-metamorphic slate that is intercalated with metamorphosed fine-grained sandstone, argillaceous limestone, micrite, and siliceous rock that is intercalated with volcanic rocks), which are strongly linked with volcanic eruptions and show obvious hydrothermal sedimentary (metasomatism) characteristics (Zheng et al., 2012). The sedimentary of the aforementioned strata have successively passed through Late Precambrian to Devonian pre-rift, Carboniferous to Early Jurassic syn-rift, and Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous passive continental margin sediment environments (Fig. 1B; Liu and Einsele, 1994; LeFort et al., 1996; Garzanti, 1999).\nWith the continuous extrusion of the Indian continent to Eurasia, the crustal deformation in the collisional orogenic process has been split into two stages. The lower crust flowed and the upper crust shortened during the early stage (>18\u00a0Ma), and crustal extension and rifting occurred in the late stage (<18\u00a0Ma; Yin and Harrison, 2000). This tectonism resulted in development of EW-trending detachment faults, NS-trending normal fault systems, and dome structures related to deep detachment within the NHMB (Fig. 1B; Ding et al., 2006). The older EW-trending detachment faults (25 \u2013 11\u00a0Ma) are represented by the Lazi-Qiongduojiang, Rongbu-Gudui, and Luozha faults, and the STDS (Fig. 1B; Armijo et al., 1986; Maluski et al., 1988; England and Houseman, 1989; Harrison et al., 1992; Yin, 2000), which are related to the formation of a series of rifts zones (e.g., the Sangri-Cuona, Yadong-Gulu, Shenzha-Xietongmen and Dangreyongcuo-Gucuo rift zones; Li et al. 2005). The younger normal faults (18 to 4\u00a0Ma) are accompanied by modern hydrothermal activities concentrated in the Lejinkangsang, Xiaba and Dongga fault zones (Fig. 1B; Yin et al., 1999; Williams et al., 2001), which result from the east\u2013west extension of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Coleman and Hodges, 1995; Kapp et al., 2008). The EW-trending and NS-trending faults with the characteristics of several episodes of motion have provided upwelling channels for magma, ore-forming hydrothermal fluids and geothermic springs, which controlled the distribution of igneous rocks and ore deposits within the NHMB (Zheng et al., 2014). From west to east, there are a series of dome structures within the NHMB (e.g., Kangma, Ranba and Yelaxiangbo dome; Fig. 1B; Lee et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2004). These metamorphic core complexes are composed of extensional structures and rock associations, the core is usually Cenozoic light-colored granite, the middle floor includes mylonitized gneiss, phyllite, and garnet schist, and the Mesozoic North Himalayan sedimentary rock series is the outmost (Harrison et al., 1995; Zhang, 2007).\nThe regional Mesozoic and Cenozoic magmatism have generated intermediate-basic, basic and acidic volcanic rocks and intrusions during the Yanshanian Period, and intermediate-acidic intrusions during the Himalayan Period. From Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous, multiple suites of bimodal igneous rocks developed within the NHMB that comprise diabase, gabbro, basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, explosion-breccia and cinerite. The basic dyke swarms (134.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0Ma, 135.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0Ma, 138.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0Ma) and gabbro (155.8\u00a0Ma) show approximate zircon SHRIMP U\u2013Pb ages (Bian and Ding, 2006; Jiang et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2007). For the petrogenetic model, there are two opinions: (1) these basic dyke swarms are the products of the late-stage massive expansion of the Neo-Tethys Ocean, which symbolizes the Himalaya passive continental margin intensive stretching and breaking-off, lithospheric extension-thinning and asthenospheric upwelling (Pan et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2004; Tong et al., 2007); and (2) these basic dyke swarms, formed in the continental-rift environment, are the result of interactions between the mantle plume and lithospheric mantle material (Zhu et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2010). The Cenozoic intermediate-acidic intrusive masses are distributed in the core of dome structures and EW-trending faults in the form of laccoliths, batholiths and dykes, principally consisting of monzogranite, leucogranite, diorite, porphyritic diorite, and aplite units (Fig. 1B; Nie et al., 2005; Zeng et al., 2012). During the Post-Collision Period (25 \u2013 9\u00a0Ma), the collision of India-Eurasia Plates has not only provided upwelling channels for plutonic magma and hydrothermal fluids, but also created necessary material, dynamic and spatial conditions for crustal remelting (Harrison et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 1997; Hou et al., 2006; Hou et al., 2015a; Hou et al., 2015b). These Cenozoic igneous rocks are considered to result from crustal thickening during the convergence process, which is associated with partial melting of the middle and upper crust caused by extension and compression of the STDS (Burchfiel et al., 1992; Guillot and Le Fort, 1995; Searle et al., 1997; Murphy and Mark Harrison, 1999; Wang et al., 2018). The aforementioned tectonomagmatism has induced a series of regional thermal metamorphism, dynamic metamorphism, contact-thermal metamorphism, and migmatization that influenced the migration and enrichment of the ore-forming elements within the NHMB (Zheng et al. 2014).\n\n\n2.2\nOre deposit geology\nThe Keyue deposit (coordinates: 28\u00b023\u203230\u2033 \u2013 28\u00b026\u203200\u2033N, 92\u00b003\u203200\u2033 \u2013 92\u00b006\u203200\u2033E) is located approximately 43\u00a0km west of Longzi County Town in Tibet, where is only 5\u00a0km away from the Zhaxikang deposit (Fig. 1B). The Lower Jurassic Ridang Formation (dip angle: 10\u00b0 \u2013 20\u00b0), dominated by a set of epi-metamorphic marine clastic rocks that mainly consist of slate and some shale with few instances of quartzose sandstone, calcareous sandstone, limestone and tuff, hosts the majority of mineralization within the orefield (Fig. 2\n). Some Middle Jurassic Zhela Formation is composed of limestone and dolomite with few instances of phyllite rock, slate and quartz siltstone intercalated with altered intermediate-basic volcanic rock also crops out within the orefield (Fig. 2A and 2C). In addition, there were few Quaternary sediments distributed along the valleys (Fig. 2A and 2C).\nIntense tectonism has developed a series of faults and some folds within the orefield, which led to different degrees of deformation and metamorphism for the rocks within the strata. Two main faults (F1 and F2) that control the distribution of seven orebodies, have been identified by the geological mapping and engineering projects within the orefield (Fig. 2A and 2B), both of which cross-cut the Ridang Formation. The NS-striking F1 fault (length: 1600\u00a0m, width: 100\u00a0m, attitude: 265\u00b0 \u2013 295\u00b0, dip angle: 50\u00b0 \u2013 70\u00b0) is larger than the EW-striking F2 fault (length: 500\u00a0m, width: 1 \u2013 15\u00a0m, attitude: 110\u00b0 \u2013 120\u00b0, dip angle: 55\u00b0 \u2013 70\u00b0). These veined, stratiform and lenticular orebodies have ramifications in the depth and obvious hydrothermal activity-related cracks. The largest and richest orebody within the orefield is the orebody 1, which is controlled by fault F1 and hosts the majority of the reserves (Fig. 2A and 2B).\nRegional magmatic and volcanic activities have generated a series of intermediate-basic and acidic igneous rocks that is hosted by the Ridang Formation within the orefield. Specifically, the diabase is distributed in the central orefield and is identified by drillhole and footrill, which presents as dykes that emplaced into the Jurassic Ridang Formation (Fig. 3\nA-C); and the meta-basalt is usually near orebodies and is distributed in slate or the contact area of slate and diabase in the form of a consequent layer or shear layer (Fig. 3D-F). There are various types of alteration occurring within the orefield that are associated with mineralization: (1) the carbonatization, distributed together with the orebodies along the fault (Fig. 2C), relates to Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in the form of Mn\u2013Fe carbonate veins (Fig. 4\nA and 4C); (2) the silicification, generally located in fault zones in the form of quartz veins, radiating quartz, and quartz druse, is related to Sb mineralization (Fig. 2C and 4B); (3) the weak sericite alteration usually occurs within meta-basalt and diabase near the upper plate of orebodies as green spots (Fig. 4C), and anomalous interference color can be observed under microscope (Fig. 4D). Additionally, although the ore-forming elements display no horizontal zoning, there is a good vertical zoning from the altitude of 4422 to 4722\u00a0m within orebody 1: a lowermost Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn zone\u00a0\u2192\u00a0a central Ag\u2013Sb (Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) zone\u00a0\u2192\u00a0an uppermost Sb (Hg) zone (Fig. 2C; Wang et al., 2018b).\n\n\n2.3\nOre characteristics and ore paragenetic sequence\nWithin the Keyue deposit, the main ore minerals are mainly sphalerite, galena, pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, freibergite, boulangerite, andorite, jamesonite, bournonite, and stibnite; and the gangue minerals are mainly Mn\u2013Fe carbonate, quartz and calcite (Figs. 5\u20137\n\n\n). Through careful hand specimen and microscopic observations, the ore paragenetic sequence for these ore and gangue minerals are recognized as two distinct episodes that are further subdivided into six ore mineralization stages based on the cross-cutting relationships and paragenetic mineral association (Fig. 5). The first episode (stages 1 and 2) is Pb\u2013Zn mineralization that developed Mn\u2013Fe carbonates and sulfides; the second episode (stages 3\u20136) is primarily Sb mineralization that generated quartz, calcite, sulfosalt minerals, and sulfides. Details are as follows.\nStage 1, characterized by a Mn\u2013Fe carbonate\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite\u00a0+\u00a0arsenopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0sphalerite assemblage, is the initial stage of ore formation in the Keyue deposit. The fine-grained pyrite, arsenopyrite and sphalerite are hosted in Mn\u2013Fe carbonate and slate to form lamellar (Fig. 6A and 6B) and disseminated (Fig. 6C) ore textures. The minerals from later stages replaced and cut the stage 1 minerals (Fig. 6B, 6C, and 7A).\nStage 2, dominated by the development of a Mn\u2013Fe carbonate\u00a0+\u00a0galena\u00a0+\u00a0sphalerite\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite\u00a0+\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite assemblage, hosts the majority of the Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in the Keyue deposit. There are more numerous sulfides, which are hosted by coarse-grained Mn\u2013Fe carbonate and slate with the banded and massive ore textures (Fig. 6A, 6D-F, and 7B-C).\nStage 3 is the transitional stage between two episodes of mineralization and is marked by the formation of a quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0calcite\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite\u00a0+\u00a0sphalerite\u00a0+\u00a0galena\u00a0+\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0arsenopyrite assemblage without Mn\u2013Fe carbonate. Massive and veined sulfides occur in quartz and calcite (Fig. 6G-I and 7D-F). Most of the sulfides in this stage are overprinted and reflect the replacement and modification of earlier sulfides (Fig. 7B-D).\nStage 4 is identified by a mineral assemblage composed of quartz\u00a0+\u00a0antimony-lead-silver sulfosalt minerals (Fig. 4R) that prevailingly include boulangerite and jamesonite, as well as minor bournonite, tetrahedrite, freibergite and andorite. This stage hosts the majority of Sb mineralization and yields ores with relatively high average Ag grades. The minerals formed in earlier stages are usually replaced and cross-cut by the quartz-boulangerite veins and boulangerite (Fig. 6B-C, 7C, and 7F). Ores in this stage exhibit the massive, veined and needle-like ore textures (Fig. 6J-L and 7G-H).\nStage 5 is distinguished by the formation of a quartz\u00a0+\u00a0stibnite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0cinnabar assemblage and hosts part of the Sb mineralization within the Keyue deposit. The massive, elongated, and radial stibnite was hosted by quartz (Fig. 6L-N and 7I).\nStage 6 represents the youngest stage of mineralization in the Keyue deposit and comprises a quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0calcite assemblage without sulfides. Quartz-calcite veins of this stage cross-cut the earlier formed minerals and slate (Fig. 6O).\nThe supergene stage, developed at the shallowest elevation, has generated geyserite, valentinite, ferrohydrite, smithsonite, sardinianite, travertine and malachite (Fig. 5).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\nCadmium (Cd) does not easily form independent minerals and is commonly found enriched by isomorphic replacement with other elements (e.g., replacing Zn in sphalerite) within the mineral structure. Thus, sphalerite is the most ideal mineral for Zn\u2013Cd isotopic research in Pb\u2013Zn deposits. Because of the absence of Zn\u2013Cd-bearing minerals from stages 4 to 6 and the difficulty in collecting the lamellar sphalerite in stage 1, nine sphalerite and four galena samples from stages 2 and 3 were selected for relevant analyses; four sphalerite-galena coexisting mineral pairs were in these samples.\nThe sphalerite and galena from the Keyue deposit crystallize well (Fig. 6A-J), and the purification process is as follow: First, because of the corresponding hand specimen and microscopic observations, the relatively pure sphalerite and galena blocks were cut down from ore samples. Second, the sulfide blocks were crushed to 60 \u2013 80 mesh; next, the careful separation and handpicking of sphalerite and galena grains were completed under a binocular microscope on the basis of color, size, clarity, and morphology. Finally, the purified sphalerite and galena grains were ground to 200 \u2013 300 mesh for further verification and purification, and conventional heavy liquid and magnetic separation techniques were also used to assist. After these procedures, the purity of sulfide powders would be more than 99.99%, which can satisfy the Zn\u2013Cd isotope analytical demand.\nElemental (Zn, Cd, Fe and Cu) concentration measurements were conducted using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP\u2013OES) instrument at the Pennsylvania State University. Approximately 30 to 100\u00a0mg of sulfide powder was dissolved in 4\u00a0ml of heated (120 \u2103) ultrapure aquaregia for 12\u00a0h. Next, the aliquots from each solution were acidified and diluted in 2% nitric acid for chemical analysis. Elemental concentrations were determined using standard calibration curves that ranged from 0.6 to 10\u00a0ppm. Indium was used as an internal standard, and the errors for analyses were usually within 5%. These concentration data were used to determine the amounts of Zn and Cd required for isotope analysis.\nBoth Zn\u2013Cd isotopes were measured on the Neptune MC\u2013ICP\u2013MS at the Rutgers University. The BioRad MP-1 anion exchange resin was used to purify Zn according to the protocol described by Mar\u00e9chal et al. (1999). Yields from the columns were tested volumetrically on the ICP\u2013OES at the Pennsylvania State University and were all greater than 95%. As suggested in the literature (Archer and Vance, 2004; Chapman et al., 2004, 2006; Peel et al., 2008), the mass bias corrections for Zn using Cu (NIST 976) were employed for these samples and then the corrected values were bracketed by the standards. Solutions were measured at 100\u00a0ppb Cu and 150\u00a0ppb Zn (63Cu\u00a0=\u00a07\u00a0V and 66Zn\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0V). One block was 30 ratios in the analytical session, and the Zn isotope values are reported in traditional per mil notation relative to the AA\u2013ETH standard: \u03b466Zn (\u2030)\u00a0=\u00a0[(66Zn\/64Zn)Sample\/(66Zn\/64Zn)AA\u2013ETH \u2013 1]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01000. All the data cited in the literature were converted relative to the AA\u2013ETH standard (\u03b466ZnAA\u2013ETH\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b466ZnJMC3\u20130749L \u2013 0.28\u2030; Archer et al., 2017). The AA\u2013ETH standard was also compared relative to IRMM 3702 and the obtained \u03b466Zn value (0.03 \u2030) was within the error reported in Archer et al. (2017). Throughout the analytical sessions, the reference material AA\u2013ETH standard compared with itself (n\u00a0=\u00a014) yielded two standard deviations of 0.07\u2030 (2\u03c3) for \u03b466Zn, which is larger than the error for each sample during the run. Therefore, a conservative estimate of error is that of the uncertainty (2\u03c3: 0.07\u2030) of the standard throughout the run sequence.\nAnion exchange chromatography was used for Cd purification (Cloquet et al., 2005). After two rounds of column chromatography, the volumetric yields of the samples were greater than 94%. The detailed procedures are as follows: (1) 2\u00a0ml of wet BioRad AG MP-1 resin chloride form (100\u2013200 mesh) was added to a 10\u00a0ml BioRad chromatography column; (2) the resin was sequentially cleaned with 10\u00a0ml of 2% HNO3, 10\u00a0ml of MQ water (18.2\u00a0\u03a9), and 5\u00a0ml of 1.2\u00a0M HCl; (3) the samples were loaded onto the resin with 1\u00a0ml of 1.2\u00a0M HCl, and the unwanted ions were sequentially eluted with another 4\u00a0ml of 1.2\u00a0M HCl, 15\u00a0ml of 0.3\u00a0M HCl and 16\u00a0ml of 0.012\u00a0M HCl; (4) the Cd was collected in 17\u00a0ml of 0.0012\u00a0M HCl in the final elution. To eliminate Sn, we repeated the aforementioned procedures while using a new resin for the second column. The Faraday cup configuration was as follows: 116Sn mass was monitored in the H4 cup, with 110Cd in the L1 cup, 111Cd in the Ax cup, 112Cd in the H1 cup, 113Cd in the H2 cup, 114Cd in the H3 cup, 107Ag in the L4 cup and 109Ag in the L2 cup. The instrument setup, sample introduction and running conditions are followed those published in Wasylenki et al. (2014). The 100\u00a0ppb NIST 987 Ag isotope standard was used for all analytical samples for mass bias correction using the exponential fractionation correction (Marechal et al., 1999). The measured 107Ag\/109Ag ratio of the NIST 987 Ag isotope standard was 1.07638. Solutions were kept at 100\u00a0ppb Cd, with on-peak blank subtraction in two blocks (15 ratios each). The measured values are presented relative to the NIST SRM 3108 Cd standard in per mil notation defined as \u03b4\n114\/110Cd (\u2030)\u00a0=\u00a0[(114Cd\/110Cd)Sample\/(114Cd\/110Cd)NIST SRM 3108 \u2013 1]\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01000 (Abouchami et al., 2013). To facilitate comparison, all the Cd isotopic data used in this study were converted relative to the NIST SRM 3108Cd standard: \u03b4\n114\/110CdNIST SRM 3108\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b4\n114\/110CdSpex \u2013 0.11\u2030 = \u03b4\n114\/110CdJMC \u2013 0.08\u2030 = \u03b4\n114\/110CdBAM-I012 \u2013 1.33\u2030 = \u03b4\n114\/110CdM\u00fcnster \u2013 4.49\u2030 (Cloquet et al., 2005; Abouchami et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017). The reported values are an average of two separate measurements at different times, and the errors fall within the range of 0.08\u2030 (2\u03c3n\u00a0=\u00a014) of the standards. Because the error between the measurements was less than the reported variation of the standard during the analytical session, this uncertainty was regarded as the measurement error.\n\n\n4\nResults\nAll elemental and Zn\u2013Cd isotopic data are listed in Table 1\n. The galena has the Zn and Cd concentrations of 0.06% \u2013 0.28% (average value\u00a0=\u00a00.16%, n\u00a0=\u00a04) and 33 \u2013 52\u00a0ppm (average value\u00a0=\u00a044\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a04), with Zn\/Cd ratios ranging from 11.5 to 63.6 (average value\u00a0=\u00a035.3, n\u00a0=\u00a04). The \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values for the four galena samples are \u20130.38\u2030, 0.39\u2030, 1.11\u2030 and 3.17\u2030, respectively (average value\u00a0=\u00a01.07\u2030 \u00b1 2.64\u2030, 2SD, n\u00a0=\u00a04). By contrast, the sphalerite exhibit Zn, Cd, Fe and Cu concentrations of 43.68% \u2013 56.28% (average value\u00a0=\u00a049.35%, n\u00a0=\u00a09), 1415 \u2013 2175\u00a0ppm (average value\u00a0=\u00a01775\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a09), 3.84% \u2013 8.12% (average value\u00a0=\u00a06.43%, n\u00a0=\u00a09) and 1208 \u2013 2742\u00a0ppm (average value\u00a0=\u00a01860\u00a0ppm, n\u00a0=\u00a09), respectively. The total \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of sphalerite range from \u20130.28\u2030 to 0.58\u2030 (average value\u00a0=\u00a00.13\u2030 \u00b1 0.49\u2030, 2SD, n\u00a0=\u00a09) and \u20130.38\u2030 to 0.38\u2030 (average value\u00a0=\u00a0\u20130.13\u2030 \u00b1 0.53\u2030, 2SD, n\u00a0=\u00a09), with the Zn\/Cd ratios of 200.8 \u2013 397.7 (average value\u00a0=\u00a0285.5, n\u00a0=\u00a09).

(2016) investigated the Cd concentrations, Zn\/Cd ratios, and Cd isotopic compositions of sphalerite from nine Pb\u2013Zn deposits within China and then divided them into three categories: (1) the Low-T(temperature) system (MVT Pb\u2013Zn deposits), (2) The High-T(temperature) system (porphyry, magmatic-hydrothermal, skarn, and VMS Pb\u2013Zn deposits), and (3) the Exhalative system [the SEDEX (sedimentary exhalative) Pb\u2013Zn deposits and seafloor hydrothermal sulfides]. When comparing with these three categories, the sphalerite from the Zhaxikang (low Cd concentrations: 1183 \u2013 2199\u00a0ppm, correspondingly high Zn\/Cd ratios: 248 \u2013 421, large Cd isotopic variation range with relatively lower \u03b4\n144\/110Cd values: \u20130.51\u2030 to 1.01\u2030) and Keyue (low Cd concentrations: 1415 \u2013 2175\u00a0ppm, correspondingly high Zn\/Cd ratios: 200.8 \u2013 397.7, large Cd isotopic variation range with relatively lower \u03b4\n144\/110Cd values: \u20130.38\u2030 to 0.38\u2030) deposits both display Zn\u2013Cd elemental and isotopic characteristics similar to those of the Exhalative system (low concentrations: 295 \u2013 1174\u00a0ppm, correspondingly high Zn\/Cd ratios: 211 \u2013 510 and large Cd isotopic variation range with relatively lower \u03b4\n144\/110Cd values: \u20130.49\u2030 to 0.35\u2030], but obviously differ from the Low-T system (high Cd concentrations: 2415 \u2013 34981\u00a0ppm, relatively higher \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values: \u20130.10\u2030 to 0.59\u2030 and low Zn\/Cd ratios: 17 \u2013 201) and High-T system (moderate Cd concentrations: 2410 \u2013 4126\u00a0ppm, tight Cd isotopic variation range: \u20130.25\u2030 to 0.05\u2030 and moderate Zn\/Cd ratios: 155 \u2013 223) (Wen et al., 2016; Fig. 11\n). From the Zn isotopic perspective, the \u03b466Zn values of sphalerite from the Keyue and Zhaxikang deposits are \u20130.28\u2030 to 0.58\u2030 and \u20130.38\u2030 to 0.07\u2030 (Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a), respectively. Compared with various types of Pb\u2013Zn deposits, for example, the Gorno and Raibl magmatic-type deposit in Italy (\u20130.26\u2030 to 0.16\u2030), the skarn-type deposits in the Tongling ore district in China (\u20130.20\u2030 to \u20130.23\u2030), the Tianqiao (\u20130.54\u2030 to 0.30\u2030) and Banbanqiao (\u20130.21\u2030 to 0.43\u2030) carbonate-hosted Pb\u2013Zn sulfide deposits in China, the Irish-type deposit in Ireland (\u20130.45\u2030 to 1.05\u2030), the Cevennes MVT deposit in France (\u20130.34\u2030 to 0.19\u2030), the Xiaobaliang VHMS-type deposit in China (\u20130.18\u2030 to 0.42\u2030), the Alexandrinka Volcanic Hosted Massive Sulfide (VHMS)-type deposit in Russia (\u20130.48\u2030 to \u20130.05\u2030), the Red Dog SEDEX-type ore district in Alaska (\u20130.28\u2030 to 0.32\u2030), and the Dongshengmiao SEDEX-type deposit in China (\u20130.11\u2030 to 0.12\u2030), the Zn isotopic compositions exhibit large overlaps for these deposits with different genesis (Fig. 12\n).\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe occurrence states of cadmium in galena and sphalerite\n\nPalero-Fern\u00e1ndez and Mart\u00edn-Izard (2005); Cook et al. (2009); Zhou et al. (2011) and Belissont et al. (2014) have studied the occurrence states of metal elements in galena and sphalerite, which are used to relate to specify ore genetic models. Under these circumstances, we confirmed the occurrence states of cadmium in galena and sphalerite from the Keyue deposit by comparing them with those of the Zhaxikang and Fule MVT deposits. Zhu et al. (2017) suggested that the Cd2+ enters into sphalerite by direct substitution with Zn2+, and both Zn and Cd present as sphalerite micro-inclusions within galena in the Fule MVT deposit; whereas Wang et al. (2020) inferred that both Zn2+ and Cd2+ should enter into galena by direct isomorphic replacement with Pb2+, and Zn2+ is directly substituted by both of Cd2+ and Fe2+ during the crystallization of sphalerite in the Zhaxikang deposit. Based on the outlined comparisons of the elemental characteristics of galena and sphalerite listed in Section 4, there are many similarities between the Keyue and Zhaxikang deposits, but differences with the Fule MVT deposit. Accordingly, we suggest that both Zn2+ and Cd2+ should enter into the galena by direct isomorphic replacement with Pb2+, and the Zn2+ should be directly substituted by Fe2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+ during the crystallization of sphalerite in the Keyue deposit: ZnSsolid\u00a0+\u00a0Cd(Fe, Cu)2\u00a0+\u00a0Liquid\u00a0=\u00a0Cd(Fe, Cu)SSolid\u00a0+\u00a0Zn2\u00a0+\u00a0Liquid (Mookherjee, 1962; Tsusue and Holland, 1966; Sverjensky et al., 1997). The situations in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits should be identical, but Wang et al. (2020) did not analyze the Cu concentrations of sphalerite.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for ore genesis\nAs outlined in Section 4, the sphalerite from the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits display similar Zn\u2013Cd elemental and isotopic characteristics only found in the Exhalative system (Fig. 11). Meanwhile, Wen et al. (2016) has also established Cd isotopic evolution models for Low-T, High-T, and Exhalative systems based on the unique characteristics of different ore-forming systems (Fig. 13\n), which can illustrate the Cd isotopic variations during the deposition of aqueous Cd in different hydrothermal fluids. Notably, neither of the evolution models for the Low-T and High-T systems are suitable for the Keyue deposit (Fig. 13A and 13B), whereas the evolution model for the Exhalative system is in good agreement with the Cd isotopic variation in the Keyue deposit (Fig. 13C). Notably, although there are large overlaps of \u03b466Zn values for different types of deposits, the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits are most similar to the SEDEX-type or VHMS-type deposits, yet obviously distinct from the narrow range of magmatic-hydrothermal deposits (Fig. 12). Additionally, the seafloor hydrothermal fluid system (\u03b466Zn: \u20130.28\u2030 to 0.96\u2030; Fig. 12; John et al., 2008) can generate the \u03b466Zn values of sphalerite from these two deposits.\nThe aforementioned comparisons have demonstrated that SEDEX genesis is most plausible for the Pb\u2013Zn mineralization in the Keyue deposit, which is consistent with geology, mineralogy, elements, H\u2013O\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopes, and fluid inclusion evidence from Wang et al. (2018b). The situation is similar in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits, the SEDEX metallogenesis (first episode of mineralization) generated the Pb\u2013Zn(\u2013Ag\u2013Mn\u2013Fe\u2013Cu\u2013Cd\u2013Ga) mineralization, and the ore characteristics were similar to those of the Red Dog SEDEX-type ore district with typical submarine hydrothermal sedimentation (metasomatism) origin (Moore et al. 1986; Zheng et al., 2012). The second episode of magmatic-hydrothermal metallogenesis was the main Sb mineralization. There is a series of Sb and Sb\u2013Au deposits within the NHMB (e.g., the Shalagang Sb and Mazhala Sb\u2013Au deposits; Fig. 1B), contemporary with the second episode of mineralization in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits (Zheng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2019). The latter Sb mineralization within the NHMB does not contribute other metals (e.g., Pb, Fe, Ag and Cu) to the deposits, because all of these Sb and Sb\u2013Au deposits contain no corresponding mineralization. According to this finding, in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits, Sb should originate from the second episode of mineralization, and Zn, Pb, Fe, Cd, Ag and Cu should source from the first episode of mineralization.\n\n\n5.3\nThe variation and fractionation mechanism of Zn-Cd isotopes\nA diverse set of processes has been demonstrated to induce metal stable isotopic fractionation. Wang et al. (2017), Wang et al. (2018a), Wang et al. (2020) have discussed in detail the background of Zn\u2013Cd isotope fractionation, excluded other possible possibilities, and finally demonstrated that the metal isotopic fractionation is most likely related to the vapor\u2013liquid dynamics of ore-forming fluid in the Zhaxikang deposit. Considering the similar Zn\u2013Cd isotopic characteristics and other situations in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits, only the most possible fractionation mechanism is verified, and other unnecessary details are not provided, to avoid repetition.\nSimilar to the Zhaxikang deposit, the Zn\u2013Cd isotopic compositions of four sphalerite-galena coexisting mineral pairs from the Keyue deposit show obvious Cd isotopic fractionation between sphalerite and galena (Fig. 14\nA), but the fractionation did not attain equilibrium (Fig. 14B). The galena exhibits an extremely large Cd isotopic variation range (\u20130.38\u2030 to 3.17\u2030) with low Cd concentrations (33 \u2013 52\u00a0ppm), which is a result of Cd isotopic fractionation and large Cd concentration differences between sphalerite (1415 \u2013 2175\u00a0ppm) and galena (Wang et al., 2020). Accordingly, the Cd isotopic fractionation between sphalerite-galena mineral pairs must have some contributions to the Cd isotopic variations in the Keyue deposit but still cannot decipher well the gradually decreasing trend from stages 2 to 3 in \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values (Fig. 15\n).\n\nSchwartz (2000) and Schmitt et al. (2009) have proposed that Zn and Cd have shown similar geochemical behaviors and experienced similar hydrothermal evolution histories in Pb\u2013Zn deposits. Related research and theoretical calculations both confirmed that the light Zn\u2013Cd isotopes preferentially fractionate into the solid phase relative to relevant fluids (John et al., 2008; Schmitt et al., 2009; Horner et al., 2011; Gagnevin et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015). Therefore, mineral precipitation-induced fractionation has been used to decipher the increasing \u03b4\n114\/110Cd (e.g. MVT: Zhu et al., 2017) and \u03b466Zn (e.g. Irish-type: Wilkinson et al., 2005; SEDEX: Kelley et al., 2009) values with time within Pb\u2013Zn deposits. However, both the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of sphalerite from the Keyue deposit display a temporally decreasing trend (Fig. 15), which is a different pattern. Nevertheless, the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of sphalerite show no good correlations in both the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits, which may be due to the unsimultaneous precipitation of Zn and Cd, and coincides with the isomorphic replacement between Zn2+ and Cd2+. Furthermore, in modern volcanic-associated submarine vent systems, there is a correlation between \u03b466Zn values and Fe\u2013Cu concentrations for sphalerite with time (John et al., 2008) because Fe and Cu are rapidly precipitated when hydrothermal fluids mix and cool (Seewald and Seyfried, 1990; Metz and Trefry, 2000). However, there is no correlation between \u03b466Zn (or \u03b4\n114\/110Cd) values and Fe\u2013Cu concentrations for sphalerite in the Keyue deposit (Fig. 16\n), which reveals that the ore-forming model is not simple deposition of aqueous metal.\nWhen studying the Zhaxikang deposit, Wang et al. (2018a), Wang et al. (2020) demonstrated the kinetic Rayleigh fractionation mechanism and used Rayleigh distillation associated with vapor\u2013liquid partitioning to model the temporally decreasing \u03b456Fe, \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values. Herein, we speculate that this fractionation mechanism is also appropriate for the Keyue deposit based on the following evidence. First, the first episode of mineralization was demonstrated to have SEDEX genesis (Wang et al., 2018b), and the degasification is ubiquitous in the exhalative system. Second, the fluid inclusion data from sphalerite and cogenetic Mn\u2013Fe carbonate and quartz indicate that vapor\u2013liquid two-phase inclusions are dominant (more than 90%; Wang et al., 2018b). Third, evaporation has been linked to Cd isotope fractionation in nature previously (Wang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013). Finally, this fractionation mechanism could result in a temporally decreasing trend (e.g., Cu: Graham et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2016).\nNevertheless, these studies have paid too much attention to vapor\u2013liquid partitioning while ignoring the simultaneous metal precipitation. We argue that three-phase (solid\u2013liquid-vapor) separation is synchronized within the ore-forming system. From this, we proposed a three-phase separation distillation model to illustrate the metal migration and isotope partitioning during ore formation (Fig. 17\n). Initially, there was vapor\u2013liquid-solid three-phase separation within the ore-forming system, and the increment of vapor (volatile phase) was preferentially enriched in light Zn\u2013Cd isotopes relative to the initial (first episode) ore-forming fluid, which led to the enrichment of heavy Zn\u2013Cd isotopes in the early precipitated sphalerite. Next, followed by the removal of precipitated minerals from the ore-forming system and condensation of the volatile phase back to the ore-forming fluid, the isotopic values of the residual ore-forming fluid and subsequent minerals have lower and lower values (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2020). Overall, in the Keyue deposit, the three-phase separation within the ore-forming system is the main cause of the Zn\u2013Cd isotopic variations.\n\n\n5.4\nThree-phase separation distillation model\nIn this study, we developed a simple open system three-phase separation distillation model to further constrain more details during ore formation and verify its correctness. For this discussion, we assume that the simplest explanation for Zn\u2013Cd isotopic fractionation would be a physiochemical change within the ore-forming system. Rayleigh distillation is used for two- phase partitioning, but this three-phase separation distillation cannot simply be divided into two Rayleigh distillation processes (vapor\u2013liquid partitioning and liquid\u2013solid partitioning). Thus, we use the following original mass-conversation equation to establish this model (Rayleigh, 1902):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nX\n\n\nF\nl\n,\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b4\nX\n\n\nF\nl\n,\ni\n\n\n-\n\u03a3\n\n\n\u03b4\nX\n\n\nV\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n,\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nf\n\nV\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n,\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n(\n1\n-\n\u03a3\n\nf\n\nV\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n,\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n=\nF\n\ni\n\n\u00d7\n\n(\n1\n-\n\u03a3\n\nf\n\nV\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n,\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere\u00a0X\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of interest, V\u00a0=\u00a0vapor, Fl\u00a0=\u00a0ore-forming fluid, M\u00a0=\u00a0sphalerite, F\u00a0=\u00a0the fraction of reactant remaining, 1 \u2013 F\u00a0=\u00a0the fraction of the initial Zn\u2013Cd partitioned into volatile phase and precipitated into sphalerite, f\u00a0=\u00a0the fraction of Zn\u2013Cd separated from ore-forming fluid each time, i\u00a0=\u00a0each time increment the three-phase separation occurred. Equations (1) and (2) are used to predict the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values given different fractions of Zn\u2013Cd among the volatile phase, ore-forming fluid and precipitated sphalerite. The following geological facts and rationale assumptions were applied to the construction of the model:\n(1) Both in the Keyue and Zhaxikang deposits, sphalerite is the dominant carrier for the Zn\u2013Cd, Zn\u2013Cd concentrations of sphalerite are dozens higher than galena (Table 1; Wang et al., 2020). Accordingly, the models merely compare the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of sphalerite. Moreover, there is a particular positive \u03b4\n114\/110Cd value (1.01\u2030) in the Zhaxikang deposit (Wang et al., 2020), which is excluded to ensure an accurate comparison.\n(2) As discussed in Section 5.2, the initial \u03b4\n144\/110Cd value (\u20130.11\u2030; Fig. 13) of the exhalative system (Wen et al., 2016) and the calculated average \u03b466Zn value (\u20130.14\u2030) of the first episode of ore-forming fluid in the Zhaxikang deposit (Wang et al., 2018a) is regarded as \u03b4XFl,0.\n(3) Considering that metals should be principally transported by ore-forming fluid rather than vapor, we reasonably set the proportions between Zn\u2013Cd partitioned into volatile phase and precipitated into sphalerite (fV:fM) as 1:10.\n(4) Wang et al. (2020) selected the Cd isotopic fractionation factor (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.99943) to construct the Cd isotopic Rayleigh fractionation model for the Zhaxikang deposit. In terms of consistency, herein, we assume \u0394114\/110CdFl-V and \u0394114\/110CdM-Fl are both 0.6\u2030. Comparatively speaking, the Zn isotopic variation range was larger than that of the Cd isotope. To fit the actual situation, we validly regard the \u039466ZnFl-V and \u039466ZnM-Fl both as 0.9\u2030.\n\nFig. 18\n is the established model. The red curve shows the Zn\u2013Cd isotopic compositions of instantaneously precipitated sphalerite as a function of the progressive extraction of isotopically heavier Zn\u2013Cd from the ore-forming fluid, the pink line depicts the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of the vapor as a function of progressive extraction of isotopically lighter Zn\u2013Cd from the ore-forming fluid, and the blue curve displays the Zn\u2013Cd isotopic evolution of coexisting ore-forming fluid. The \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values of sphalerite from the Keyue and Zhaxikang deposits cover the 1 \u2013 F from 21.56% to 75.42% (Fig. 18A), 19.96% to 82.81% (Fig. 18B), 60.59% to 78.82% (Fig. 18C), and 54.59% to 86.79% (Fig. 18D), respectively. In both these deposits, the \u03b466Zn and \u03b4\n114\/110Cd values cover the similar 1 \u2013 F ranges, indicating the correctness of the fractionation mechanism. Furthermore, the precipitation of measured sphalerite covers almost the entire three-phase separation process in the Keyue deposit, yet only the latter half period in the Zhaxikang deposit.\n\n\n5.5\nConstraints on the genetic relationship between the Keyue and Zhaxikang deposits\nThe Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits show commonalities in geology, mineralogy, fluid inclusion, H\u2013O\u2013S\u2013Pb isotopes, and elemental and Zn\u2013Cd isotopic characteristics. Thus, a genetic relationship must exist between these two deposits, which have the same metal origins and experience similar ore formation and ore-forming fluid evolution.\nNevertheless, the following delicate differences between these two deposits are informative: (1) the Keyue deposit contains more amounts of chalcopyrite in stages 2 and 3, but fewer types of sulfosalt minerals in stage 4 (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018b); (2) mineralization stages 1 and 6 in the Keyue deposit are not as developed as those of the Zhaxikang deposit; (3) according to fluid inclusion data, calculated metallogenic depths for the first episode of mineralization in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits are 3.7 \u2013 9.3\u00a0km and 3.0 \u2013 7.4\u00a0km, but the calculated metallogenic depths for the second episode of mineralization are both 1.1 \u2013 5.6\u00a0km (Wang et al., 2018b); (4) orebodies within the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits are chiefly located at the altitude of approximately 4100 \u2013 4900\u00a0m and 4300 \u2013 4700\u00a0m, respectively; (5) these two deposits are separated only by a regional NS-trending normal fault with strike-slip properties during the Post-Collision Period (25 to 9\u00a0Ma) of the India-Eurasia Plate. As outlined, the ore formation in the Keyue deposit is more concentrated on the main SEDEX mineralization, and the regional NS-trending normal fault and Plateau Uplift lead to a wider distribution of orebodies within the Zhaxikang deposits. Therefore, the Keyue deposits experience a more intense exhalative environment and weaker overprint, but the more intense latter overprint and wider distribution of orebodies result in a much larger scale and more metal reserves in the Zhaxikang deposit.\nEqually important, the three-phase separation models reveal that the precipitation of measured sphalerite almost covers almost the entire ore formation process in the Keyue deposit but only overlays the latter half period in the Zhaxikang deposit (Fig. 18). From the mineral exploration perspective, the earlier period (0% \u2013 19.96%) and later period (82.81% \u2013 100%) of ore formation represent a potential chance to generate sphalerite below 4300\u00a0m and above 4700\u00a0m in the Keyue deposit (Fig. 19\n). By contrast, the earlier period (0% \u2013 54.59%) of ore formation in the Zhaxikang deposit shows substantial exploration potential for Zn\u2013Cd below 4100\u00a0m (Fig. 19), and there are almost half of the resources have not been identified at depth theoretically. Wang et al. (2021) showed the decreasing \u03b4109Ag values from stage 2 to stage 3 and from deep to shallow along with the trend of orebody V in the Zhaxikang deposit, which proves that the ore-forming fluid evolves from deep to shallow. Theoretically, there should be a gradually decreasing trend in Zn\u2013Cd isotopic values from deep to shallow; thus, positive Zn\u2013Cd isotopic values imply potential Zn\u2013Cd mineralization at depth. In the Zhaxikang deposit, the particular positive \u03b4\n114\/110Cd value (1.01\u2030) further confirms this inference (Wang et al., 2020).\nThe genetic model of these two deposits is illustrated in Fig. 20\n (Wang et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2019), and ore formation are mainly experienced three regional mineralization events:\n(1) In the Syn-Sedimentary Period (220 \u2013 130\u00a0Ma), multiple seafloor volcanic events influenced the reducing environment in rifts and the adsorption of organic matter, which led to enrichment of ore-forming elements (e.g., Pb, Zn, Mn, Fe, Au, Ag, Cu, Ga, Cd) in Late Triassic-Early Cretaceous flysch formations formed by turbidity sediment and carbonaceous-siliceous-argillaceous rock series related to hydrothermal sedimentation, and then the seafloor hydrothermal system circularly leached out these ore-forming elements to form Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag sulfides (first episode of mineralization) in the Keyue and Zhaxikang deposit (Fig. 20A).\n(2) In the Syn-Collision Period (60\u201342\u00a0Ma), with the collision of India-Eurasia plates, the Plateau Uplift and complicated tectogenesis associated with orogeny eroded and destroyed the early bedded Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag orebodies (Fig. 20B).\n(3) In the Post-Collision Period (25\u20139\u00a0Ma), with the development of STDS, the metamorphic core complex, and the extensive emplacement of leucogranite, Sb-bearing magmatic-hydrothermal fluids overprinted the first episode of mineralization and formed the Sb\u2013Pb\u2013Zn\u2013Ag polymetallic orebodies (Fig. 9C).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe comparative research between the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits allows us to draw the following conclusions:\n\n(1)\nIn the Keyue deposit, both Zn2+ and Cd2+ should enter into the galena by direct isomorphic replacement with Pb2+, and the Zn2+ is directly substituted by Fe2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+ during sphalerite crystallization.\n\n\n(2)\nSEDEX genesis is most plausible for the first episode of mineralization in the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits.\n\n\n(3)\nA genetic relationship must exist between the Zhaxikang and Keyue deposits, which have the same metal origins and experience similar ore formation and ore-forming fluid evolution.\n\n\n(4)\nThere is substantial exploration potential for Zn\u2013Cd at deeper elevations within the Zhaxikang orefield.\n\n\n(5)\nZn\u2013Cd isotopes have the potential to trace metal sources, monitor fluid evolution, constrain ore formation, and provide insights into mineral exploration.\n\n\n\n\n","68":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAs one of the most important Au-bearing deposit types, orogenic gold deposits have attracted intensive investigations in many decades and no consensus has been reached concerning their genesis (Goldfarb and Groves 2015). Most Mesozoic giant gold deposits in the North China Craton (NCC) have been identified as the orogenic gold type, characterize by auriferous quartz veins or wall rock alterations (Miller et al. 1998; Groves et al. 1998; Hart et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2009; Goldfarb et al. 2020). They are hosted in the Precambrian basement and are controlled by faults (Goldfarb et al. 2001, 2005; Hart et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2006; Goldfarb and Groves 2015; Yang et al. 2016; Deng et al. 2017; Groves et al., 2020). Much controversy still exists regarding whether their metal and fluid sources are metamorphic or derived from mantle with variable involvements of meteoric water (Powell et al. 1991; Nesbitt 1993; Mao et al. 2003a; Chen et al. 2008; Phillips and Powell 2010; Yang et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2019a). Recently, inputs of magmatic or mantle-derived fluids have been proposed to explain variations in metal contents, isotopic compositions, and mineralogy of individual orogenic gold deposits in the NCC (Robert 2001; Goldfarb et al. 2005; Hammond et al. 2011; McFarlane et al. 2011; Treloar et al. 2015; Spence-Jones et al., 2018). Wang et al. (2019) have highlighted the importance of mantle-derived, Au-bearing hydrous magmas in their origin, whereas a metamorphic fluid source from devolatilization of metasedimentary or metabasic rocks has been proposed for the formation of the majority of the orogenic deposits worldwide or in the NCC (Kerrich, 1989; Goldfarb et al. 1991; Goldfarb et al., 1993; Mccuaig and Kerrich 1998; Large et al. 2007; Phillips and Powell. 2010; Pitcairn et al. 2015; Bark et al. 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Qiu et al. 2020). In contrast, the magmatic hydrothermal deposits have relatively specific features in the sources of fluids and metals.\nThe Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district represents an important Mesozoic gold mineralization area in the NCC (Fig. 1\n). Previous work has focused on fluid inclusions and isotopes of the large gold deposits in the district. Some workers have proposed that the majority of the gold deposits were associated with magmatism (Hart et al. 2002). For example, the Dongwujiazi orogenic gold deposit (Early Jurassic) was subjected to a mixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids (Zhang et al. 2009a). The Jinchanggouliang gold deposit (131\u00a0Ma) was probably a magmatic-hydrothermal deposit with involvements of magmatic fluids (Liu et al. 2019b), similar to the Anjiayingzi gold deposit (130\u00a0Ma), of which the ore-forming fluids, sulfur and metals were related to degassing and devolatilization of Early Cretaceous magmatism (Fu et al. 2016). In contrast, other workers have argued for an orogenic type and suggested that the sulfur- and gold-bearing fluids were generated during retrograde metamorphism, as exemplified by the Shanwanzi and Yuerya gold deposits (Sun 2013; Li et al., 2020b). Therefore, the metal and fluid sources, and the genetic type of the gold deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district remain ambiguous.\nThe Triassic Taijiying gold deposit in the eastern Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district, controlled by northeast- and northwest-trending faults, is hosted in the Xiaotazigou Formation of the Archean Jianping Group and has auriferous quartz veins and alteration of wall rocks. Investigations on the sources of the ore-forming fluids and metals of the Taijiying gold deposit can provide crucial clues to determine the genesis of the early Mesozoic gold deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district. In this context, based on detailed field studies, we provide new zircon U-Pb data for the ore-related granitic porphyry and pre-mineralization diorite dike to constrain the timing of metallogeny. Fluid inclusions and H-O isotopes for auriferous quartz and S-Pb-Os isotopes of Au-bearing pyrite are analyzed to examine the features and origin of the ore-forming fluids and metals. New data helps us understand the genesis of the Taijiying gold deposit, shedding lights on locating the prospective gold deposits on the northern margin of the NCC.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe triangular NCC with an area of ca. 1,500,000\u00a0km2 is bounded by the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) to the north, the Su-Lu UHP belt to the east, the Qilian Orogen to the west and the Qinling-Dabie Orogenic Belt to the south (Fig. 1a). It experienced significant crustal growth at ca. 2.5\u20132.7\u00a0Ga (Zhai and Zhou, 2015). The amalgamation of the Eastern and Western Blocks along the N-S trending Trans-North China Orogen is generally considered to have occurred at\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.85\u00a0Ga (Zhai and Zhou, 2015). At ca. 1.32\u00a0Ga, tholeiitic diabase sills or dike swarms constitute a Mid-Mesoproterozoic large igneous province in the northern NCC (Zhang and Zhao, 2016). The multiple-stage lithospheric thinning and destruction of the NCC resulted from the intense westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic plate during Mesozoic.\nThe Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district is located on the northern margin of the NCC, adjacent to the CAOB to the north (Fig. 1a and 1b). This district comprises three NE-trending uplift belts, including the Kalaqin and Yiwul\u00fcshan metamorphic core complexes (MCCs), and the Lunu\u2019erhu uplift. The district consists mainly of Precambrian basement rocks and Paleozoic to Mesozoic magmatic and sedimentary rocks (Fig. 1c). The Precambrian basement rocks are composed of the Xiaotazigou Formation of the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic Jianping Group, which consists of sedimentary and volcanic sequences, and tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneisses with different degrees of migmatization (LBGMR 1989; Liu et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2019b). These rocks were metamorphosed to granulite facies at ca. 2485\u00a0Ma and were retrograded to greenschist facies at ca. 2450\u20132401\u00a0Ma (Kr\u00f6ner et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2011).The Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata of the region consist of thickly bedded limestone and dolomite, which unconformably overlie the Archean basement rocks (Song et al., 2016). Mesozoic volcanic rocks are continental volcanic rocks, which mainly include basalt, basaltic andesite, andesitic breccias, tuff (Fu et al. 2012).\nThe Permian-Triassic magmatism may have been caused by the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and the amalgamation between the Mongolian arc terranes and the NCC along the Solonker suture during late Permian to Early Triassic time (Xiao et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2009b; Zhang et al., 2005c; Zhang et al., 2009d). The Triassic intrusions are mainly distributed in the southern Chifeng City and dominated by granodiorite and alkalic granite, with minor basic and ultrabasic rocks. The Cretaceous magmatic rocks that were attributed to the post-collisional\/post-orogenic extension and decratonization of the NCC (Mao et al. 2003b; Chen et al. 2009) mainly formed at 130\u2013120\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2014).\nThe structural framework in this district is dominated by the EW-trending Chifeng-Kaiyuan Fault, the NE-trending Lingyuan-Beipiao Fault, and the NNE-trending Honghan-Balihan Fault (Fig. 1c). The Chifeng-Kaiyuan Fault separates the Hingan-Mongolian orogenic belt (the middle and east parts of the CAOB) from the NCC (Zeng et al. 2011). It had been active since the Proterozoic, as evidenced by a zircon U-Pb age of 1860\u00a0Ma for plagioclase amphibolite in the Baoyintu Group (Chen et al. 2015) and had been reactive in the Caledonian and Variscan period. Due to the oblique subduction of the Paleo-Pacific oceanic plate, this fault was re-activated in the Cretaceous along with formation of coeval gold-related intrusions. The left lateral compression-torsion Lingyuan-Beipiao Fault extends from Lingyuan to Beipiao City with a length of more than 200\u00a0km, which also formed in the Proterozoic due to the collision between the Siberia Craton and the NCC in the Indosinian. Weakly extensional reactivation in the Early Cretaceous did not change its Jurassic compressional features. The Honghan-Balihan Fault consists of a\u00a0\u223c\u00a03\u00a0km-thick ductile and ductile\u2013brittle shear zone passing upward into\u00a0\u223c\u00a0100\u00a0m-thick brittle chloritic breccia and\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.5\u00a0m-thick microbreccia with fault gouges (Wang and Zheng 2005). It has been active since the Late Jurassic. They divide the study area into several rhombic blocks, where gold deposits and magmatic rocks are exposed (Zhang et al. 2010). Furthermore, the NE-trending Jiguanshan Fault is a compression-torsional normal fault located between the former two faults in the northwestern part of the Taijiying gold field (Fig. 2\na). It was thought to have started from the Variscan and been strongly reactivated in the Yanshanian (refs?). This local fault dips to NW with a dip angle of 60\u00b0 and 50\u00a0km in length and plays a significant role in defining the distribution of acidic dikes, subordinate fractures, and gold mineralization.\nThe Archean metamorphic rocks and Mesozoic granites constituting the three MCCs host many gold deposits (e.g. the Anjiayingzi, Jinchanggouliang, and Paishanlou deposits) related to magma underplating and fluid metasomatism. The chronologic results indicate that the gold metallogenesis occurred at 250\u2013230\u00a0Ma, coincident with the post-orogenic extension (Yang and Wu 2009; Zhang et al. 2009b, c, d; Zeng et al. 2011). Those formed at 140\u2013120\u00a0Ma were possibly related to the decratonization of the NCC (Shao et al. 1999; Wu and Sun 1999; Zhai et al. 2002).\n\n\n3\nDeposit geology\nThe medium-sized Taijiying gold deposit owned by the Nanjing Mingda Mining Co., Ltd, is located approximately 9\u00a0km northwest of Heichengzi Town and has newly explored gold reserves of 15.1\u00a0t with a grade of 11.1\u00a0g\/t Au, which has not been conducted under official mining yet (Qu et al., 2015; Fig. 2b). The ore bodies are hosted in the Jianping Group, which is bounded by the Chifeng-Kaiyuan Fault to the north, the Jiguanshan Fault to the northwest, and the Lingyuan-Beipiao Fault to the southeast (Fig. 1c).\n\n3.1\nWall rocks and ore-controlling structures\nThe Archean Jianping Group is the main wall rock of the gold lodes and comprises predominately metamorphic volcanic and sedimentary rocks with a small portion of magnetite quartzite and pyroxene magnetite quartzite (Liu et al. 2011). EW-trending diorite and NE-trending granite porphyry dikes are exposed within the metamorphic basement. The former is crosscut by gold lode I, indicating that the diorite dike is pre-metallogenic. However, the latter is basically parallel to the gold lode I and locally related to it, indicating a close spatial and genetic relationship between the granite porphyry dike with the gold mineralization (Fig. 2b and Fig. 3\na).\nMost gold lodes are hosted by a series of NNE-trending compressional reverse faults and NW-trending extensional normal faults (Fig. 2 and Table 1\n). Four NNE- and NE-trending compressional faults show dip angle of 40\u00b0 to 77\u00b0 and 146\u00a0m to 850\u00a0m in length. The longest fault F1 is characterized by a length of 2\u00a0m to 4\u00a0m, massive, fragmented, breccia of wall rocks, strong silicification, and weak chloritization (Fig. 4\na, b). As the subordinate fractures, two NW-trending extensional faults hosting the gold lodes III to VII are shorter and shallower than the former ones, with a length of 75\u00a0m to 340\u00a0m and a depth of 100\u00a0m to 450\u00a0m. Many branches are also observed along the main faults. Extensive quartz veins indicate strong silicification in mineralization (Fig. 4c). The presence of cataclasite and breccia indicate that these faults experienced brittle deformation.\n\n\n3.2\nOre bodies\nOre lodes are partially covered by Quaternary and Cretaceous volcanic tuff. Ten economic lodes have been identified with a thickness of 0.7\u00a0m to 1.8\u00a0m, a length of hundreds of meters, and a dip angle of 40\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 (Table 2\n). The primary lode I is controlled by compressional faults F1 with a large depth and few branches. This lode shows a dip direction of 320\u00b0 to 330\u00b0 and a dip angle of 40\u00b0 to 76\u00b0. The scale revealed by drilling holes are 850\u00a0m in length and 650\u00a0m in depth with an average thickness of 1.02\u00a0m and an average grade of 11.49\u00a0g\/t. The distribution of high grade zone is consistent with that of granite porphyry dike, especially the contact zone. On the contrary, the secondary important lode VI is defined by the extensional faults with a smaller scale (280\u00a0m in length and 300\u00a0m in depth) and more branches (Fig. 3). Lode VI is nearly perpendicular to the former one with a dip direction of 215\u00b0 to 220\u00b0 and a dip angle of 63\u00b0 to 66\u00b0. Its width ranges from 0.77\u00a0m to 0.85\u00a0m and grade varies from 10.28\u00a0g\/t to 12.22\u00a0g\/t. The mineralization types are wall rock alteration and\/or quartz vein types (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4d-4i).\n\n\n3.3\nMineralization and alteration\nThe wall rock alterations occur near the ore bodies and include silicification, sericitization, pyritization, chloritization, and carbonatization (Fig. 5\n). The pyritization is closely related to gold mineralization, the degree of which depends on the features of pyrites, such as grains, color, and crystallinity. For example, the black fine-grained anhedral pyrites usually indicate a higher grade of Au than the pale yellow coarse-grained euhedral pyrites (Fig. 6\na, b, h, i). Carbonatization is characterized by euhedral to subhedral carbonate minerals (calcite) in the veinlets (0.5\u20135\u00a0mm), suggesting the end of mineralization.\nThe ore minerals are predominantly pyrite with minor pyrrhotite (locally altered to limonite), native gold, electrum, galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite (Fig. 6). The gangue minerals are dominated by quartz, chlorite, sericite, and calcite. Native gold with sizes of 10\u201380\u00a0\u03bcm occurs as rounded grains, breccia, branches, flakes, emulsions, or irregularly shaped fine grains within intergranular spaces and filling fissures. Some gold grains occur as irregular inclusions within pyrite and chalcopyrite (Fig. 6). Ore structures are mainly massive, veinlet, and disseminated, and locally banded and brecciated (Fig. 4d-4i).\nBased on field observations, mineral assemblages, and crosscutting relationships, the mineralization can be divided into four stages: (I) clouded-white quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite; (II) gray quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite; (III) quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfides; and (IV) calcite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz (Fig. 7\n). Stage I is characterized by clouded-white barren quartz veins with minor pyrites. stage II is the main gold mineralization stage, defined by fine-grained anhedral pyrite (py II) with disseminated gold and a small amount of electrum. Stage III shows weak gold mineralization and is marked by the presence of sulfides, such as pyrite (py III), chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite. Stage IV is represented by calcite and quartz, reflecting the end of gold mineralization.\n\n\n3.4\nSamplings and methods\nSamples TJY-1 (granitic porphyry) and TJY-2 (diorite) were collected for laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating. The sampling locations are shown in Fig. 3. Representative gold ore samples were selected from different stages for fluid inclusion and H-O isotopic analyses, and Au-bearing pyrites were selected for S, Pb, and Re-Os isotopic analyses. The methods are detailed in the supplementary material ESM_1.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nZircon U-Pb dating\nGranitic porphyry (TJY-1): Zircons are mostly euhedral, columnar, and colorless with a length of 120\u2013180\u00a0\u03bcm and a width of 60\u2013130\u00a0\u03bcm. The analyzed grains exhibit oscillatory growth zoning (Fig. 8\na) and have high Th\/U ratios (0.44\u20131.01) (Appendix A). Their U and Th concentrations are 419\u20131747\u00a0ppm and 184\u20131603\u00a0ppm, respectively, and exhibit a positive correlation, reflecting their magmatic origin (Belousova et al. 2002; Hoskin and Schaltegger 2003). 15 analyzed spots cluster on the concordia line (Fig. 8a) and yield a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 242\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a02.5).\nDiorite (TJY-2): Zircons are mostly euhedral columnar and colorless with a length of 70\u2013140\u00a0\u03bcm and a width of 30\u201370\u00a0\u03bcm. The analyzed grains have clear oscillatory growth zoning (Fig. 8b), low U (37\u201391\u00a0ppm), high Th concentrations (74\u2013222\u00a0ppm), a positive correlation between U and Th, and high Th\/U ratios (1.14\u20132.23), which reflect their magmatic origin (Appendix A; Belousova et al. 2002; Hoskin and Schaltegger 2003). 10 spots cluster closely on the concordia line (Fig. 8b), yielding a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 258\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.7).\n\n\n4.2\nFluid inclusions\n\n4.2.1\nPetrography\nQuartz represents the host mineral of the fluid inclusions at the four stages. There are late secondary fluid inclusion trails in the gold deposits, but secondary CO2-H2O fluid inclusion trails cutting through primary fluid inclusions were not observed in Fig. 9\n. All fluid inclusions (FIs) in this study were treated as primary FIs. Based on the components and phase transition characteristics of the inclusions at room temperature, three types of FIs are identified in the Taijiying gold deposit (Fig. 9): type 1 FIs (vapor-rich inclusions) (Fig. 9b), type 2 FIs (CO2-H2O three-phase inclusions) (Fig. 9a-d), and type 3 FIs (liquid-rich inclusions) (Fig. 9c, d, g).\nType 1 FIs: these inclusions consist of a liquid phase and a vapor bubble with vapor bubbles occupying 60\u201385\u00a0vol%. They are mainly 3\u20138\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter with irregular and oval shapes. These inclusions homogenize to the vapor phase when heated. They commonly appear as clusters with the type 2 FIs in the stages I-III (Fig. 9a, c, e).\nType 2 FIs: these inclusions consist of aqueous and two carbonic phases (Figs. 9a-d, f). They have generally irregular and oval shapes with a diameter of 3\u00a0\u03bcm to 13\u00a0\u03bcm and bubbles occupying 40\u201380\u00a0vol%. These inclusions are the most common type of inclusions at all paragenetic stages, accounting for approximately 45% of the total inclusions. They coexist with the types 1 and 3 FIs as clusters or scattered forms.\nType 3 FIs: these inclusions are mainly 2\u00a0\u03bcm to 12\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter with oval, rounded, irregular, and negative crystal shapes (Fig. 9b, c, d, g). Most vapor\u2013liquid ratios are 5\u201335\u00a0vol%. This type of FIs accounts for approximately 35% of the total inclusions and often coexists with the type 2 FIs as clusters or scattered forms. These FIs are distributed in groups or as individual in quartz at all stages.\nThe FIs in quartz at the stage I consist of the types 1 and 2, which are mainly 4\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter and have irregular, oval, and negative crystal shapes with most vapor\u2013liquid ratios of 45\u201385\u00a0vol%. Most FIs are present as clusters or isolated ones, indicating a primary origin. The three types of FIs at the stage II are mainly 3\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter with vapor\u2013liquid ratios of 10\u201380\u00a0vol% and scattered or in groups with irregular to negative crystal shapes. The FIs at this stage contain abundant type 2 inclusions with subordinate types 1 and 3, accounting for 60%, 25%, and 15% of the total inclusions, respectively. All types of FIs are observed in quartz at the stage III with an increasing volume of the type 3 inclusions (40%). The type 1 and 2 FIs decrease to 15% and 45%, respectively. These FIs are also scattered or in groups with irregular to negative crystal shapes. The type 3 FIs (2\u00a0\u03bcm to 12\u00a0\u03bcm, mostly 8\u00a0\u03bcm) are much larger than those at the stage II. The type 3 FIs are the major FIs at the stage IV, accounting for approximately 75% of the FIs with various sizes from 2 to 11\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. These inclusions appear as clusters or isolated ones with oval or irregular shapes. The vapor\u2013liquid ratios range from 5\u00a0vol% to 30\u00a0vol%.\n\n\n4.2.2\nFluid inclusion microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy\nMicrothermometric analysis was conducted on the primary FIs in quartz from all stages. The ore-related aqueous-carbonic inclusions have formed clathrate and some of the water have been frozen in clathrate when the ice melts. Thus, the water, in which the ice melting is measured, is uncharacteristically concentrated in salt. Salinities have been calculated from the clathrate melting temperatures for the aqueous-carbonic inclusions. The data for the FIs in this study are listed in Table 3\n and illustrated in Fig. 10\na.\nThe type 1 FIs at the stages I to III homogenize to the vapor state, and the homogenization temperatures (Th, total) are variable, from 317 to 352\u2103 (an average of 333\u2103), 308\u2013321\u2103 (an average of 315\u2103), to 243\u2013282\u2103 (an average of 272\u2103), respectively. The final ice melting temperatures (Tm, ice) are \u22124.9 to \u22125.9 \u2103, \u22123.6 \u2103, and \u22123.4 to \u22124.2 \u2103, respectively, yielding the salinities of 7.7\u20139.1\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 8.4\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), 5.9\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv, and 5.5\u20136.7\u00a0wt% NaCl eq (average 6.0\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), respectively.\nThe type 2 FIs at the stages I to III homogenize to the liquid state, and the Th, CO2 values vary in a narrow range of 23.7\u201330.2 \u2103 (an average of 29.6 \u2103), 23.3\u201331.1 \u2103 (an average of 27.9 \u2103), and 22.7\u201330.9 \u2103 (an average of 26.4 \u2103), respectively. The homogenization temperatures (Th, total) are mainly 285\u2013334 \u2103 (average 322 \u2103), 276\u2013337 \u2103 (average 308 \u2103), and 265\u2013329 \u2103 (average 290 \u2103), respectively. The final clathrate melting temperatures (Tm,cal) of 5.2\u20136.3 \u2103, 6.1\u20139.0 \u2103, 4.5\u20137.9 \u2103 yield the salinities of 7.0\u20138.7\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 7.9\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), 2.0\u20137.3\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 5.4\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), and 4.2\u20139.8\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 7.2\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), respectively. The pressures vary in the range of 137\u2013275\u00a0MPa (average 221\u00a0MPa for stage I), 140\u2013244\u00a0MPa (average 203\u00a0MPa for stage II), and 128\u2013269\u00a0MPa (average 179\u00a0MPa for stage III), which were calculated from the homogenization temperatures of the three-phase inclusions by using the FLINCOR software (Brown, 1989).\nThe type 3 FIs at the stages II to IV homogenize to the liquid state, and the Th, total values are 220\u2013317 \u2103 (average 283 \u2103), 228\u2013320 \u2103 (average 250 \u2103), and 124\u2013223 \u2103 (average 175 \u2103), respectively. The final ice melting temperatures (Tm,ice) of \u22122.6 to \u22124.0 \u2103, \u22122.8 to \u22123.7 \u2103 ,and \u22121.3 to \u22123.6 \u2103 corresponds to the salinities of 4.3\u20136.5\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 5.8\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), 4.6\u20136.0\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 5.5\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), and 2.2\u20135.8\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv (average 4.0\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), respectively.\nThe results of representative laser Raman spectroscopic analyses are shown in Fig. 9. The gas component of the type 1 FIs at the stage II is mainly CO2 (Fig. 9i). The liquid component of the type 2 at the stage III and that at the stage IV is confirmed to CO2 (Fig. 9h). The results of the fluid inclusion microthermometry and laser Raman spectroscopic analyses suggest that the ore-forming fluids generally belong to a H2O-NaCl-CO2 system.\n\n\n4.2.3\nTrapping pressure and mineralization depth\nThe H2O-CO2 three-phase inclusions, which are not only common during fluid immiscibility or phase separation, but also need no pressure correction, are used to estimate the trapping pressures in this study. The trapping pressure estimation can be performed since an independent entrapment temperature is known (Brown and Hagemann 1995). The type 2 FIs at the first three stages are used to estimate the trapping pressures by using the FLINCOR program and the formula for the H2O-CO2-NaCl system (Brown and Lamb 1989). The trapping temperatures of the stages I to III are 285\u2013334 \u2103, 276\u2013337 \u2103, and 265\u2013329 \u2103, which yield the trapping pressures of 137\u2013275\u00a0MPa, 140\u2013244\u00a0MPa, and 128\u2013269\u00a0MPa, respectively (Table 3).\nThe characteristics of the mixed brittle-ductile ore-forming structures (Fig. 4) and the pressure fluctuations in the Taijiying deposit imply a fault-valve mechanism (Sibson et al. 1988). The fault-valve model for shear zone-controlled deposits proposes a cyclic fluid pressure fluctuation from lithostatic to hydrostatic due to the episodic tectonic activities in the shear zone. The trapping pressures of the FIs are generally considered to represent (supra)-lithostatic systems when the fluid pressures were over 40\u00a0MPa (Sibson et al. 1988). According to the function (h\u00a0=\u00a0p\/\u03c1g, p is the homogeneous pressure, \u03c1 is the density, and g\u00a0=\u00a09.8\u00a0N\/m2), the minimum pressures estimated for the main stages II to III correspond to a depth of\u00a0\u223c\u00a05\u00a0km. The maximum pressures estimated for the two stages correspond to a mineralization depth of\u00a0\u223c\u00a09\u00a0km, given that the density of the overlying Jianping Group is\u00a0\u223c\u00a02.85\u00a0g\/cm3. Accordingly, we infer that the gold mineralization in Taijiying mainly occurred at depths of 5\u20139\u00a0km, consistent with the Dongfeng gold deposits (Wen et al. 2015). The Taijiying gold deposit is slightly deeper than most deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district, e.g., Jinchangyu (4\u20138\u00a0km), Xiaotazigou (1.6\u20132.8\u00a0km), Zhuanshanzi (1.2\u20133.3\u00a0km), Jinchanggouliang (2.6\u20137.1\u00a0km), Dongwujiazi (5.1\u20135.4\u00a0km), and Anjiayingzi (5.1\u201310.1\u00a0km) (Fu et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n4.3\nOxygen and hydrogen isotopes\nThe oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of 6 quartz samples from the main ore-forming stages II and III are presented in Table 4\n and Fig. 10b. The measured \u03b418Oquartz values of quartz at the two stages range from 10.9 to 11.6\u2030 and 11.5\u201311.7\u2030, respectively. According to the quartz-water fractionation equation (1000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0ln\u03b1quartz-water\u00a0=\u00a03.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0T\u22122 \u20133.40, Clayton and Bloomquist 1973) and the homogenization temperatures calculated from the fluid inclusion data, the oxygen isotope compositions of the ore-forming fluids can be calculated from the oxygen isotope compositions of quartz. The \u03b418Ow values of the two mineralization stages II and III are 4.1\u20134.8\u2030 and 3.5\u20133.7\u2030, respectively. The corresponding \u03b4D values of the fluid inclusion water in quartz are \u2212110\u2030 to \u221287\u2030 and \u2212101\u2030 to \u221298\u2030, respectively.\n\n\n4.4\nS, Pb, and Re-Os isotopes\nThe sulfur and lead isotopic compositions of ten pyrite samples from the stages II and III are listed in Table 5\n. The \u03b434S values of the ten pyrite samples show a narrow range (+1.7 \u2030 to\u00a0+\u00a02.1 \u2030), with an average \u03b434S value of\u00a0+\u00a01.9 \u2030. Lead isotope compositions consist of 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a018.175\u201318.422 (an average of 18.262), 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.572\u201315.619 (an average of 15.597), and 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a035.758\u201337.970 (an average of 38.180). The \u03bc (\u00b5 =238U\/204Pb) values for the samples at the stages II and III are 9.01\u20139.44 and 8.98\u20139.09, respectively. Blank-corrected Re and Os data for the five pyrite samples from the Taijiying Au deposit is given in Table 6\n. The five samples contain 0.76\u201315.14\u00a0ppb Re and 0.01\u20130.07\u00a0ppb Os. The common Os and 187Os contents are 0.00371\u20130.0256\u00a0ppb and 0.00600\u20130.0564\u00a0ppb, respectively. 187Re\/188Os ratios range from 160.6 to 6259, and 187Os\/188Os ratios range from 3.251 to 37.08. The Re-Os isochron age of the five pyrite samples gives 335\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a061) with an initial 187Os\/188Os ratio of 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nTiming of gold mineralization\nAlthough the Re-Os isochron age of pyrite (335\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0Ma) has been obtained, they can not be used to constrain the ore-forming age because it is not consistent with geological evidences. The mineralization timing of the Taijiying gold deposit still lacks accurate isotopic dating, but the pre-metallogenic diorite and ore-related granitic porphyry can provide robust age constraints. The diorite dike with age of ca. 258\u00a0Ma was cut through by orebody I, which provide the upper limit of mineralization age. All faults in the deposit have not penetrate the Cretaceous strata with the age of 133.6\u00a0Ma (Chen et al., 2015). It is can be considered as the lower limit of mineralization age. It seems like that the mineralization of Taijiying occurred during Triassic and Jurassic. However, the Jurassic dikes have not been identified in this field. The Middle Triassic granite porphyry almost parallel to the orebody I (Fig. 2b), indicating their temporal consistency. It is also clear that the granite porphyry dikes are closely associated with the gold orebodies in the drill cores (Fig. 3). The alteration and mineralization of the granite porphyry in the contact zone also indicate that the granite porphyry is basically contemporaneous with mineralization. The zircon U-Pb age of 242\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma for the granitic porphyry can indirectly constrain the mineralization time of Taijiying. Therefore, the Taijiying gold deposit likely formed in the Middle Triassic.\nEpisodes of metallogenic events occurred on the northern margin of the NCC (Zhang et al. 2018) at 220\u2013250\u00a0Ma and 120\u2013140\u00a0Ma (Fig. 11\na) with magmatism at 220\u2013240\u00a0Ma, 150\u2013170\u00a0Ma, and 115\u2013130\u00a0Ma (Appendix B, C). Despite of some similarities (Appendix D), the Triassic and Cretaceous gold deposits are distinct in some aspects: (1) subordinate sulfide contents of the gold ores: the Triassic gold deposits show lower contents of the subordinate sulfides than the Cretaceous deposits (Hou 2011; Song et al. 2016); (2) CO2 contents in the FIs: the gas phase in the early FIs is mainly H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CO2, whereas the later FIs show only H2O contents in the gas phase (e.g., Jinchangyu, Song et al. 2016; Jinchanggouliang, Hou 2011); and (3) temperatures and salinities: the mineralization temperatures for the Triassic gold deposits are slightly lower than those for the Cretaceous deposits. In contrast, the salinities exhibit the opposite relationship (e.g., Xiaotazigou, Li et al. 2010). Preliminary analysis suggests that the Taijiying deposit has similar features with the Triassic deposits. Accordingly, the geological features, combined with new dating results, confirm the timing of the mineralization of the Taijiying gold deposit to the Middle Triassic.\n\n\n5.2\nOrigin and evolution of ore-forming fluids\nAt the main ore-forming stages II and III, \u03b418OW values vary from 3.5\u2030 to 4.8\u2030 and \u03b4D values range from \u2212110\u2030 to \u221287\u2030, which are all lower than those for metamorphic water (\u03b418OW of 5-25\u2030; \u03b4D of \u221270 to \u221220\u2030; Taylor, 1974) and magmatic fluids (\u03b418OW of 5.5-10\u2030; \u03b4D of \u221280 to \u221240\u2030; Sheppard, 1986). In the \u03b4D vs. \u03b418Ow diagram (Fig. 10b), these values plot below the metamorphic and magmatic fields, but are closer to the magmatic field, as well as the contemporaneous gold deposits such as the Xiaotazigou (Li et al. 2010) and Zhuanshanzi gold deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district (Hou 2011; Sun et al. 2015; Song et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2019a). Particularly, the Xiaotazigou gold deposit was a Triassic magmatic hydrothermal gold deposit with \u03b4D values (-82.61\u2030 \u2013 \u221291.79\u2030) and \u03b418OW values (5.55\u2030\u20137.56\u2030) (Zhang, 2007). They plot in the area close to the magmatic fluid field (Fig. 10b). In addition, the Triassic Zhuanshanzi gold deposit was identified as typical intrusion-related gold deposits which have average \u03b4D value \u221286.13\u2030 and \u03b418OW 2.17\u2030 in the quartz-pyrite stage closing to the magmatic ranges (Fig. 10b). In the quartz-sulfides stage, the \u03b4D values dropped to the range of \u2212112.4\u2030 to \u2212108\u2030 which are more deficit than magmatic fluids. In the last quartz-calcite stage, the ores had \u03b4D values \u2212124.4\u2030 \u2013 \u2212120.1\u2030 and \u03b418OW values 2.89\u2030 \u2013 \u22128.09\u2030. This trend indicates that the ore-forming fluids were from a mixing of magmatic fluids with meteoric water (Wang et al., 2016). Sulfur isotopes also support this viewpoint (Wang et al., 2016). The Taijiying gold deposit is within 5\u00a0km of the large Late Triassic intrusive bodies in the field (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the close genetic relationship between the Triassic granitic porphyry and gold ore bodies indicates that the magmatic water could have been a primary fluid source. Inputs of metamorphic water cannot be excluded since the magmatic water had gone through the Archean metamorphic rocks into the faults (Pirajno 2007).\nThe temperatures and salinities of the Taijiying ore-forming fluids show a gradual degradation from the stage I to the stage IV (Fig. 10a). The stage I ore-forming fluids, represented by clouded-white quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite veins, belong to the H2O-NaCl-CO2 system with moderate-high temperatures (285\u2013352 \u2103) and moderate salinities (6.98\u20139.10\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv). In the stage II, the ore-forming fluids are under conditions of slightly lower temperatures (220\u2013337 \u2103) and salinities (2.04\u20137.29\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv) and are gold-rich, as represented by the gray quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite veins. The stage III exhibits lower temperatures (228\u2013329 \u2103) and slightly higher salinities (4.15\u20139.80\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv), which are represented by quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfide veins. The stage IV of the ore-forming fluids, indicated by calcite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz veins, shows a H2O-NaCl system with low temperatures (124\u2013223 \u2103) and low salinities (2.22\u20135.79\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv). The ore-forming fluids of the stages II and III are characterized by moderate-high temperatures and magmatic hydrothermal fluids with fluctuating salinities. Based on the relationship between salinities and total homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions (Fig. 10a), salinities of inclusions generally decrease with decreasing homogenization temperatures, indicating a fluid evolution involving cooling and mixing. The evolution trend of salinity and temperature is not completely linear, and some inclusions of stage II show lower salinities at higher temperatures from 210 \u2103 to 330 \u2103. These situations indicate at least two end-member fluids mixing: (1) magmatic fluid with high temperature and high salinity, and (2) a lower temperature and low salinity H2O-rich fluid (Yao et al., 1999). Mixing of magmatic and meteoric fluids is also suggested by hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of ore (Fig. 10b). In general, most of gold deposits including Taijiying in Chifeng-Chaoyang district have moderate-high temperatures and low salinities fluids which are distinct from those of typical porphyry or skarn deposits with high temperatures (400\u2013600 \u2103) and high salinities (30\u201360\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv)(Kerrich et al., 2000). Previous works suggest that these fluid types may be the end-members involved (Yao et al., 1999). The low temperatures and salinities document the influx of the meteoric water and the transition of the magmatic hydrothermal system, as also evidenced by the low-temperature calcite veining in the last stage.\nDifferent FI types coexisting in the quartz-sulfide veins at the stages II and III (Fig. 9b-f) indicates fluid phase separation or immiscibility in the Taijiying deposit, which is also supported by the microthermometric data: (1) the coexistence of the type 1 and type 3 FIs shows a similar temperature range with opposite homogenization modes (vapor phase and liquid phase, respectively); (2) the variations in the salinity of the type 2 FIs reflect phase separation or immiscibility of fluids (Lu 2011). The initial hydrothermal fluids at the stage I were likely carbonic fluids according to the existence of the vapor-rich FIs in the quartz veins. The existence of the type 1 and type 2 FIs in stages II and III quartz indicates that the two stages of the ore-forming fluids were CO2-rich. However, the stage IV quartz is dominated by the type 3 FIs, indicating that the final stage fluids were CO2-poor. Hence, the H2O-NaCl-CO2 ore-forming fluids could have evolved from CO2-rich to CO2-poor through CO2 degassing, fluid immiscibility, and meteoric water influx. Carbonic acids (H2CO3, HCO\u2013, and CO\u2013), which are the aqueous species of CO2 according to pH, act as pH buffers (Phillips and Evans 2004) by maintaining fluids in the optimal range of gold solubility close to neutral pH values. The decreasing content of CO2 facilitates the fluids to be more acidic, leading to the breakdown of the gold bisulfide complexes and precipitation (Gaboury 2019).\nIn summary, the ore-forming fluids of the Taijiying gold deposit belong to a H2O-NaCl-CO2 magmatic water system under moderate-high temperatures and moderate-low salinities.\n\n\n5.3\nSource of ore-forming materials\nThe average \u03b434S value of sulfides can represent that of the total sulfur when the mineral association is simple (Ohmoto and Rye 1979). The mapping of pyrite demonstrates that gold was sourced from primary pyrite (Large et al. 2007, 2012). Pyrite is the dominant sulfide, making up more than 85% of the sulfide in the Taijiying gold deposit so that sulfur isotopic composition could be used to constrain the source of sulfur in ore-forming fluids. Ten sulfur isotope analyses for the pyrites from the main stages II and III in the Taijiying gold deposit yield a narrow range of \u03b434S values from\u00a0+\u00a01.7 to\u00a0+\u00a02.1 \u2030 (average = +1.9 \u2030) (Table 5), which indicates that the sulfur was likely originated from a uniform source reservoir. This range of \u03b434S values in the sulfide minerals has been interpreted to be originated from a common sulfur reservoir such as mantle-derived magmatic rocks, average crustal sulfur, or metamorphosed sedimentary sulfur (Fig. 11b; Appendix E; Ridley and Diamond 2000; Chang et al. 2008). Such a narrow range of sulfur isotopic values close to 0\u2030 implies a magmatic source in the Taijiying hydrothermal deposits (Ohmoto and Rye 1979). The amphibolite-facies to granulite-facies metamorphic supracrustal sequences in the Archean Jianping Group (Liu et al. 2011) might have been the sources of metals under metamorphic reactions at the greenschist-amphibolite boundary (Zhong et al. 2015; Yakymchuk 2017; Kresse et al. 2018; Gaboury 2019), but the metamorphic reaction predated the gold mineralization by ca. 2.0\u00a0Ga. Therefore, significant contamination or assimilation of metamorphic rock sulfur is lacking, implying that the S sources of the sulfides are of a magmatic origin in the Taijiying gold deposit.\nLow concentrations of U and Th, and unradiogenic Pb isotopes enable the Pb isotope data of the sulfides as a useful geochemical tool to constrain the source of Pb (Bozkaya, 2011; Goldfarb et al., 2004). The Pb isotope compositions of the pyrites from the quartz-sulfide veins in the Taijiying gold deposit were compiled, having 206Pb\/204Pb values of 15.088\u201315.895, 207Pb\/204Pb values of 15.001\u201315.147, and 208Pb\/204Pb values of 35.758\u201337.970 (Table 5). The pyrites are characterized by homogeneous radiogenic Pb isotopes, poor in U-radiogenic Pb, and rich in Th-radiogenic Pb (Table 5, Th\/U\u00a0=\u00a03.79\u20135.33). The \u03bc values (8.82\u20139.19) are in the range of the upper crust (9.58) and the mantle (8\u20139), implying that Pb was derived from the lower crust (Zartman and Doe 1981). The relatively unradiogenic Pb isotopes are highly distinct from those of NE China, but similar to those of the NCC (Zartman and Doe 1981; Zhang 1995; Zhang et al. 2013; Fig. 11c, d; Appendix F), implying that the source of metals is likely to be NCC. The Pb isotopic ratios of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic basalts from the Chifeng-Chaoyang district (Zhou et al. 2001; Li et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2005b) reflect the mantle signatures of the NCC (Zartman and Haines 1988). In contrast, the values of the Taijiying gold deposit are similar to those of the lower crust and the Jianping Group (Wang and Tang 1994; Sun 2013). The Pb-isotope compositions of the Jinchanggouliang Triassic diorite are distinct in comparison with those of the Taijiying gold deposit, suggesting that the ore-forming metals of the Taijiying gold deposit were not directly related to the contemporaneous mantle-derived magmatism. The origin of ore formation in the Triassic Jinchangyu gold deposit has been reported to be related to lower crust, which has Pb-isotope compositions similar to those of the Taijiying gold deposit (Fig. 11c, d; Song et al. 2016). Xiong et al. (2020) compiled the Pb isotopes of representative gold deposits from the eastern Yanshan belt and propose that ore-forming metals of the Mesozoic lode gold deposits originated from metal-fertilized lower crust. In addition, a weighted average value of initial 187Os\/188Os ratio yields 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 for the studied pyrites (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a061, Table 6), which can be used to determine the origin of the metals (Song et al. 2016). The initial 187Os\/188Os value is obviously distinct from the ratio of the primary mantle (0.105\u20130.152, Walker et al. 1994; Shirey and Walker 1998), but close to the range of the crust (0.8\u20131.3) (Esser and Turekian 1993; Marcantonio et al. 1993), indicating that the ore-forming metals were mainly derived from crust-derived magmatism. Therefore, the signatures of the S-Pb-Os isotope compositions indicate that the metals in the Taijiying gold deposit were mainly sourced from the magma derived from the partial melting of the lower crust.\n\n\n5.4\nGenesis of the Taijiying gold deposit\nThe genesis of the Taijiying deposit remains ambiguous, with different models advocating a metamorphic or magmatic hydrothermal origin. To clarify the genetic type of the Taijiying gold deposit, the geological signatures, fluid inclusions, and isotopes of the Taijiying gold deposit and other gold deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district are listed in Appendix D. Major features include: (1) the gold ore bodies formed in the Early Mesozoic subduction setting (Chen et al. 2006; Zeng et al. 2009) and are controlled by a series of subordinate fracture systems of the deep faults, which is similar to the other gold deposits in the district (e.g., the Xiaotazigou deposit, Li et al., 2010; the Jinchanggouliang deposit, Hou et al. 2011); (2) the wall rock alterations are mainly silicification, sericitization, pyritization, and chloritization, with minor carbonatization, which are consistent with those of the mesothermal magmatic hydrothermal gold deposits (e.g. Jinchanggouliang-Erdaogou, Miao et al., 2003); (3) the H-O isotopes are close to the magmatic field; (4) the sulfide \u03b434S values range from 1.7 to 2.1 \u2030 (average = +1.9 \u2030), indicative of a magmatic source; (5) the Pb and Os isotopic compositions of the Au-bearing pyrites suggest that the metals were derived from the lower crust; (6) the H2O-NaCl-CO2 ore-forming fluids are characterized by moderate-high temperatures (124\u2013352 \u2103) and a large variation of salinities (2.22\u20139.80\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv.). Therefore, we infer that the deposit is probably of a magmatic hydrothermal origin based on the geological characteristics and spatial\u2013temporal relationship with the intrusions.\nThe relationship between the intrusions and the gold mineralization needs to be considered when evaluating the ore-forming fluids. As mentioned above, the Triassic magmatism took place in the ore field as dikes and in the surrounding area as large batholiths. Precise U-Pb geochronology records an age of ca. 240\u00a0Ma for the granitic porphyry dike in Taijiying, possibly constraining the gold mineralization as the Middle Triassic. Furthermore, within 5\u00a0km to the north and northwest, the emplacement of the Triassic granite batholith might have inevitably affected or controlled the gold mineralization. The above geological and isotopic evidence indicates that the Taijiying gold deposit is likely a magmatic hydrothermal gold deposit related to the Triassic granitic magamtism.\nA possible genetic scenario for the Taijiying gold deposit is illustrated in Fig. 12\n. Geochronological, petrological, and structural studies show that the convergence between the Siberian Plate and the NCC took place during the late Permian and the Middle Triassic (Chen et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2009). The Taijiying Au deposit can be attributed to the far field stresses during the continent\u2013continent collision of North China and Siberia along the northern margin of the NCC in the Early Mesozoic. A series of deep and large NNE trending faults superimposed on the EW trending faults and formed a large number of rhomboid fault basins. Meanwhile, the main tectonic direction in this area began to change from EW to NE\/NNE. At the intersection of the fault zone, different types of granitic intrusive rocks are scattered. Some of them have close spatial relationship with the gold mineralization zone. Tectonic reactivation of the cratonic margin and gold deposition coupled with magmatism were associated with asthenospheric melting triggered by lithosphere delamination (Fig. 12a). The diorite and granitic batholith and dike intruded into the Archean metamorphic rocks along the pre-existing faults. The Taijiying gold depsoit is believed to be spatially and temporally related to this magmatic event. The magmatic hydrothermal fluids evolving from the granitic magmas provided not only metals and fluids but also external heat to promote the gold-rich fluids upward, leading to the deposition with mixed features of the magmatic and meteoric fluids. Late gold precipitation occurred when the fluids were migrated along the deep-seated faults to the low-pressure zones created by the transition from the plastic to brittle deformation. The change of the physical\u2013chemical conditions resulted in the precipitation of abundant gold along the faults (Fig. 12b).\nThe Taijiying gold deposit underwent fault-controlled magmatic hydrothermal mineralization, which might represent a distal expression of the Triassic magmatic activity in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district. Regionally, the difference in the sources of the ore-forming fluids and metals between the Triassic gold deposits and the orogenic ones indicates that deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district might not be the typical orogenic gold deposits. The magmatic activities instead of the metamorphic fluids play the key role in the gold mineralization. Thus, areas documenting the Triassic batholiths with a developed fault system would be prospective targets for locating gold deposits.\nRegionally, the gold mineralization of the Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district is multiple periods from Middle-Late Triassic to Cretaceous (Zhu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), which might be controlled by the interaction between the NCC and the surrounding terranes or plates. The Early Mesozoic tectonic setting in the northern margin of NCC was always effected by the evolution of CAOB (Goldfarb et al., 2014), and the contemporaneous gold deposits were related to post-collisional\/post-orogenic extension after the final closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and amalgamation of the Mongolian arc terranes with the northern margin of NCC (Zhang et al., 2009c). The Triassic tectonic activation in the Chifeng-Chaoyang district is represented by a series of fold structures, thrust faults, ductile shear zones, schistosity zones and magmatism (Nie et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2020). The Early Mesozoic mafic\u2013ultramafic complexes and their Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions indicate the asthenospheric mantle become more significant from Early to Late Triassic, owing to strong upwelling of asthenospheric mantle and post-collisional lithospheric delamination (Zhang et al., 2009c). A series of Triassic acid and alkaline rocks also indicate that obvious lithospheric delamination and asthenosphere upwelling may have occurred during the Late Triassic, which may represent the beginning of lithospheric thinning in the northern margin of the NCC (Yang et al., 2012). The magmatic hydrothermal mineralization, including the Taijiying gold deposit, would be the response to the initial destruction of the NCC in the Early Mesozoic. During the Cretaceous, the geological evolution of the NCC was dominated by the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate, which caused the peak decratonization and led to large-scale magmatism and mineralization of gold deposits. Accordingly, the Triassic and Cretaceous gold deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district might reflect the different stages of cratonic destruction of the NCC.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe Triassic Taijiying gold deposit is hosted in a series of compressional or extensional faults. The mineralization processes can be divided into four stages: (I) clouded-white quartz\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0pyrite, (II) gray quartz\u00a0+\u00a0pyrite, (III) quartz\u00a0+\u00a0polymetallic sulfides, and (IV) calcite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz, with gold being mainly hosted at the stage II.\n\n\n(2)\nThe H2O-NaCl-CO2 ore-forming fluids of the main stages II and III was characterized by moderate-high temperatures (283-315\u2103) and low-moderate salinities (\uff1c7\u00a0wt% NaCl eqv.), and had a primary magmatic source.\n\n\n(3)\nThe features of the S-Pb-Os isotopes indicate that the Taijiying ore-forming metals were mainly sourced from the magma derived from the partial melting of the lower crust.\n\n\n(4)\nGeological and isotopic evidence suggests that the Taijiying gold deposit is probably a magmatic hydrothermal deposit. The areas recording the Triassic intrusions coupled with a developed fault system may represent prospective targets for locating gold deposits in the Chifeng-Chaoyang gold district.\n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGeophysical prospecting techniques and their application to studying mining basins have evolved considerably in recent years. The emergence of automatic data acquisition systems, the availability of powerful computers, and the development of two- and three-dimensional numerical modelling methods have markedly enhanced the resolutions of complex geological models (Loke and Barker, 1996; Andr\u00e9 et al., 2012; Binley et al., 2015).\nAmong the advantages associated with these techniques are their relatively low cost, the possibility of covering large survey areas, the vast amount of data they provide, and their non-destructive nature. Among their drawbacks, we must note the non-uniqueness of the results because they are indirect techniques requiring a data inversion process. Another disadvantage is the decrease of resolution with depth (Telford et al., 1990). For these reasons, a good practice in geophysics consists of using at least two different methods to reduce the indeterminacy (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2012; Granda Sanz et al., 2019; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019; Rey et al., 2020; Rey et al., 2021).\nGeophysical methods applicable to geological-mining research are numerous and varied, including gravimetric, magnetic, electrical, electromagnetic, and seismic methods. All of them can contribute to the ore deposit exploration in some way.\nThis study aims to analyse the capacity of electrical (electrical resistivity tomography, ERT), electromagnetic (time-domain electromagnetic surveys, TDEM) and seismic (seismic reflection) techniques when studying geological structures with mining implications. For this purpose, the old mining district of Linares-La Carolina (Southeast Spain, Fig. 1\nA) has been chosen. In addition to detailed geological surface data, direct data on numerous boreholes (Fig. 1B) and seismic lines in this mining district are available. Combined, this information provides verification and correlation tools (ground-truth data) for the indirect techniques used in this research.\nThis mining district contains mineralised dykes, primarily consisting of galena (PbS), hosted in Palaeozoic granitoids (Azc\u00e1rate, 1977; Lillo 1992; Larrea et al., 1994). The sector was subjected to intense mining and subsequently abandoned in the 1970s. The mines were then closed due to the drop in the price of this mineral and the depletion of reserves.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nIn the study region, two geological units can be differentiated: the Palaeozoic Basement and the Tabular Cover of the Iberian Plateau (also known as Meseta). The former primarily consists of intensely folded phyllites intruded by a granite stock in the last stages of the Hercynian Orogeny (Azc\u00e1rate, 1977; Larrea et al., 1994). This intrusion produces a widespread contact metamorphism aureole with a highly variable width and outcrops in the mining district, predominantly with a horst structure (Fig. 1A). Discordantly overlying this basement and arranged sub-horizontally, the post-Hercynian sedimentary cover is composed of Triassic, Miocene, and Quaternary materials (Fig. 1A and B). The Triassic cover mainly consists of red shale, with thicknesses approximately ranging from 50 to 100\u00a0m, and contains a 10- to 20-m-thick basal conglomerate layer in which sandstone beds alternate with shale facies. The Miocene materials are deposited on this suite and separated via a stratigraphic discontinuity. At the base, a calcarenite breccia bed changes laterally and vertically to marls and marly limestones with thin calcarenite intercalations. The Quaternary cover contains silt, sand and gravel and is only associated with the sedimentary filling of riverbeds (Azc\u00e1rate, 1977; Rey et al., 2013a; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019).\nThe origin of the mineralised dykes in this mining district is associated with extensional conditions and an anomalous geothermal gradient that originated at the end of the Hercynian Orogeny. The hydrothermal mineralisations resulted from the injection of the fluid phase and metals through old fractures N35-N60E and NS-N20E in the Palaeozoic basement and in the granite body. These hydrothermal veins mainly consist of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, quartz, ankerite and calcite (Azc\u00e1rate, 1977; Lillo, 1992).\nLithological control is essential in mineralisation: the veins metallise when they are hosted in the granite stock, while quickly turning into waste rock when they do so in phyllites. On one hand, mechanical factors account for this process because competent materials (granitoids) allow a frank and sharp fracturing, while incompetent materials (phyllites) react to the stress by deforming, thus hampering the formation of open spaces. On the other hand, within the metamorphic aureole created by granite in the western sector (Fig. 1A), the phyllites allow metallised veins, which are lost or disappear when hosted outside this aureole. The veins are lost because these materials undergo physical changes resulting from a contact metamorphism, thereby becoming more competent.\nOn the western boundary of the mining district, technical reports (ENADIMSA, unpublished results) indicate the presence of a structure (known as AA), with an approximately NS direction and associated with a fault breccia with ankerite and some galena. This structure was developed prior to the deposit of Triassic materials, causing the collapse of hundreds of metres of granite stock and phyllites with thermal metamorphism in the western sector (Bail\u00e9n Graben). For this reason, this structure brings facies of varying competence into contact, which is crucial for the development of mining operations. Its location will make it possible to outline the areas of greatest interest for mining research.\nThis structure and other subparallel structures have been reactivated in post-Palaeozoic stages. The last manifestation of these movements gave rise to the surface-mappable Guarrom\u00e1n Fault (Fig. 1A, Fig. 2\nA and B), which defines the western boundary of the mining district. This study aims to characterise these structures by combining the aforementioned geophysical techniques.\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nSeismic reflection method\nSeismic reflection profiles collected in the 1980s by the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain (Instituto Geol\u00f3gico y Minero de Espa\u00f1a \u2013 IGME, unpublished results) have been analysed. The Mini-Sozie method was applied, and SM-7GR geophones with a 30-Hz sensor were used to record the resulting signals.\nThe geophones were arranged in groups arrays of 18 units per trace. At each recording station the geophones were laid 1.85\u00a0m apart. The distance between traces was 15\u00a0m.\nAt each source point an average of 2,100 pulses were generated. Seismic reflection tests were performed with source offsets of 30, 45, 60 and 75\u00a0m, identifying the best reflections at a distance of 45\u00a0m. The data were processed by Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e8rale de G\u00e9ophysique (CGG). The processing flow followed a standard processing sequence, including point collection along a \u201cSlalom line\u201d, prestack deconvolution, static corrections, continuous velocity analysis, dynamic velocity corrections, automatic adjustment of residual static corrections, addition, filter (30\u00a0Hz in low and Notch), coherence improvement, and migration (IGME, unpublished results).\nThis study focuses on one of the seismic lines, namely on line 1 (its location is shown in Fig. 1A and in Fig. 2A). For the two-way-traveltime\/depth transformation, average velocities up to the base of the Miocene of about 1,900\u00a0m\/s are estimated (IGME, 1983) which would correspond to traveltimes up to 100\u2013150\u00a0ms. For the Triassic, with times up to 190\u2013240\u00a0ms, the estimated velocities are about 2200\u00a0m\/s.\nThis is the velocity that is marked when processing the seismic line and that has been verified by measuring the thickness of different units in the existing boreholes (Fig. 1B and Table 1\n).\n\n\n3.2\nElectrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method\nThis geophysical prospecting technique consists of measuring the apparent resistivity distribution in the subsoil from a very high number of observations made from the ground surface (Telford et al., 1990; Store et al., 2000). Differences in the geoelectric behaviour are expressed as 2D profiles, which are one of the most effective nondestructive tools for studying and characterising subsoil discontinuities (Sasaki, 1992; Store et al., 2000). In recent years, this technique has been widely used with satisfactory results in stratigraphic (Maillet et al., 2005; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2009; Rey et al., 2013a), hydrogeological (Goldman et al., 1994; Auken et al., 2003; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2009; Andr\u00e9 et al., 2012) and environmental studies (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016; Mart\u00ednez-Pag\u00e1n et al., 2009; Rey et al., 2013b; Rey et al., 2021; Mart\u00ednez-Segura et al., 2020).\nIn the mining district of Linares, the (very conductive) galena veins are embedded in the (very resistive) host granitic bedrock. The different electrical behavior between both lithologies makes their detection with geoelectrical surveying methods very favorable. In this regard, previous investigations in nearby locations show very promising results (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2019). However, most of the times the small size of the ore veins requires using high-density inter-electrode spacings which results in a reduced depth of investigation. For this reason, in previous works the investigated sites were selected for their thin sedimentary cover where the host granite and the embedded veins were at depths between 20 and 40\u00a0m. In this study, the sedimentary cover is thicker, and the main goal is to distinguish the consolidated bedrock with the capacity to host ore veins (granite) from that one where the development of ore veins is more difficult (phillites). A large inter-electrode spacing (10\u00a0m in this study) allows a deeper investigation albeit with a reduced resolution.\nThe tomography method consists of implanting numerous metal electrodes in the ground along rectilinear profiles, with some separation between the electrodes depending on the degree of the target resolution and depth. Higher resolution require shorter separations between electrodes whareas greater investigation depth need longer electrode spacings (Sasaki, 1992). A Wenner-Schlumberger electrode configuration was used in this study. This configuration performs well and remains stable under both vertical and horizontal resistivity changes (Dahlin and Zhou, 2004; Loke, 2014), and is therefore highly useful when studying horizontal or slightly inclined beds, which may show lateral changes in facies and\/or vertical structures, as is the case.\nThe electrodes are connected to a measuring device, which automatically controls the arrangement, selection and activation of the electrodes for each individual measurement following a pre-programmed sequence. At each observation point, the voltage and intensity are measured to calculate the apparent resistivity of the ground, which is attributed to a specific geometric point in the subsoil.\nA RESECS resistivity-meter from Deutsche Montan Technologie (DMT) was used. The electrical resistivity tomography profiles have been interpreted based on the apparent resistivities obtained in the field work, treated using the specific program RES2DINV (Loke and Barker, 1996). This calculation program is based on the least squares method with a forced smoothing and modified with the Quasi-Newton optimisation technique. The inversion method builds a subsoil model using rectangular prisms and determines the resistivity values of each prism, minimising the differences between the observed and calculated apparent resistivity values (Loke and Barker, 1996; Loke and Dahlin, 2002).\nIn this study, two electrical resistivity tomography profiles have been collected in the NW-SE and W-E directions, with lengths of 1,110\u00a0m each, 112 electrodes and a spacing of 10\u00a0m between electrodes (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.3\nTime-domain electromagnetic method (TDEM)\nThe operating principle of the time-domain electromagnetic method (TDEM) consists of circulating an electric current through a transmitter coil for short periods. When the current flow is abruptly interrupted, the primary magnetic field varies, which induces a variable electric current. This variation, in turn, generates a transient secondary magnetic field. These currents flow in closed paths and migrate in depth, decreasing in intensity over time. Changes in the secondary magnetic field over time induce a transient voltage in the receiving coil. The way in which this voltage decreases provides information on the conductivity distribution in the subsoil, which can then be used for its characterisation (Nabighian, 1988; Telford et al., 1990; McNeill, 1994).\nThe TDEM method has been typically used in field prospecting (G\u00f3mez-Ortiz et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2012; Granda Sanz et al., 2019), in hydrogeological studies (Fitterman and Steward, 1986; Danielsen et al., 2003) and in the analysis of sedimentary basins (Dennis and Cull, 2012; Sridhar et al., 2017; Rey et al., 2020). In recent times, this methodology has also been used in environmental studies (Hallbauer-Zadorozhnaya and Stettler, 2009; Hu et al., 2016) and in the characterisation of marine intrusions (Kafria and Goldman, 2006; Levi et al., 2008).\nThe TDEM measuring system used in this study was an AIE-2 model ELGEO Research & Production Company. This device has a maximum output power of 200\u00a0W and a current intensity of up to 10 A. The TDEM receiver is based on a 16-bit analogue\u2013digital converter with a signal processor that provides noise-immune analogue\u2013digital conversion of the input voltage and real-time signal preprocessing, and offers measurements ranging from 5\u00a0\u00b5s to 10\u00a0s, with an input voltage of 5\u201320\u00a0V with a signal compensation.\nIn the field campaign, a total of 13 TDEM measurement stations were installed in the SE-NW direction along the seismic line under study. The points located in Fig. 2A refer to the centre of the measurement stations at 100 by 200\u00a0m square loops. At each point, measurements have been taken using central- and single-loop configurations and varying the measurement parameters (intensity, time, and voltage), which makes it possible to compare the efficiency of different configurations. Thus, to reach study depths of approximately 100\u2013200\u00a0m (the first stations), 100X100 m transmission loops have been used. In the last stations, given the greater depth of the Palaeozoic basement (more than 250\u00a0m), the measurements had to be repeated by increasing the dimensions of the transmitter loops (200X200 m) and using a wire with a section of 6\u00a0mm2 gauge, which decreases its resistance and therefore makes it possible to reach a higher effective current intensity. When working with a central-loop configuration, the receiving coil had dimensions of 20X20 m with a 5-turn wire and a X10 amplifier. The software TEMBIN is used to visualise and edit the different curves. The modelling and inversion process is performed using the programs ZondTEM1D and ZondTEM2D.\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussion\n\n4.1\nSeismic reflection method\nIn the study region, the sedimentary filling at the top of the seismic profiles provides a moderate reflector amplitude, which is interpreted as sandstones and marls of the Upper Miocene. This suite appears to be subhorizontal, with an overlapping morphology on the lower unit (see the interval between the seismic traces 260 and 220 in the seismic profile of Fig. 3\n), which matches the marine transgression that occurred in the region during the Upper Messinian (Perconing, 1971). A slight unconformity is associated with the stratigraphic discontinuity that separates the two units of the sedimentary cover. Under the Miocene materials, in the Triassic unit, beds of greater amplitude are also detected, which correlate with the powerful sandstone beds at the base of the Triassic unit observed both in the mechanical soundings and in outcrops. Laterally, the reflector at the base of the Triassic unit can be lost due to the changes in thickness, or even to the truncation of basal conglomerates, as noted in outcrops of the western sector of the Guarrom\u00e1n Fault. The Triassic Unit dips slightly to the NW (towards the centre of the Bail\u00e9n Graben). The acoustic basement is formed by the Palaeozoic basement, which is characterised by chaotic features and disorganised seismic facies (Fig. 3). In the basement, the phyllites and the granite intrusion cannot be differentiated based on the seismic profile.\nDifferent criteria, which in general have agreed well, have been used for the time-to-depth transformation. On one hand, geological field data have been used, specifically the thicknesses of the different units measured in the vicinity. On the other hand, the velocity values were also used, which are included in the profiles. Lastly, direct data were collected in the region, thanks to mining research (Fig. 3) and groundwater boreholes.\nThe seismic reflection profile shows a series of fractures affecting the basement and the sedimentary cover. The \u201cAA Fault\u201d, which is barely detected because this fault does not affect the sedimentary cover, may be located in the easternmost sector of the profile. The Guarrom\u00e1n Fault is identified to the NW of the seismic profile (Fig. 3), which affects Miocene materials, according to outcrop data. To the south, this structure can reach up to 70\u00a0m in vertical throw, according to field observations. To the NW of the aforementioned fault, the profile shows \u201cFracture B\u201d, with a vertical throw of approximately 70\u00a0m, which affects the basement and part of the Triassic series (see Fig. 3). However, according to outcrop data, this fracture seems to be fossilised by the Miocene materials. Therefore, these three fractures have acted in different stages, albeit ultimately causing the subsidence of a graben to the NW (Bail\u00e9n Graben) and the Linares horst.\n\n\n4.2\nElectrical resistivity tomography method\nThe electrical resistivity tomography profile 1 overlaps the SE end of the seismic profile (Fig. 2A), precisely where seismic exploration, given its shallow depth, does not provide a good visualisation of the contact between the sedimentary cover and the Palaeozoic basement (Fig. 3). The current injection time is 256\u00a0ms, with 128-ms delay. In total, 2,377 measurements were taken, with a final RMS fitting error of 5.8% reached in the 5th iteration of the inversion process. Fig. 4\nA shows ERT profile 1, which reaches a 220\u00a0m depth in the zone of maximum penetration. Based on the geoelectrical characteristics, two suites are differentiated: the first suite is characterised by its high resistivity values (between 100 and 3000 \u03a9m), which are associated with the Palaeozoic basement. These facies almost reach the surface in the SE end of the profile (Linares horst). In turn, in this suite electrical facies can differentiate granitic facies from phyllites, because granitoids provide much higher resistivities. This interpretation is confirmed thanks to mechanical mining research and groundwater boreholes in the sector. The ERT 1 profile suggests an abrupt subsidence of the granite towards the NW, as observed in the outcrop (in the NE sector of Fig. 1A). This subsidence could be associated with the structure that sank the NW block of the Hercynian age (without affecting the sedimentary cover), regionally detected in some mining operations and named the AA Fault (technical reports without publication). This regional structure would have great mining importance because it causes the subsidence of competent rocks (granitoid and metamorphic aureole) for several hundred metres. Accordingly, the phylonian structures, if any, would be located at much greater depths, reducing the probability of finding mineralised structures with sufficient entity to justify the exploitation.\nOn the Palaeozoic basement, a low-resistivity unit is associated with the sedimentary cover. This upper unit has a thickness of approximately 20\u201330\u00a0m throughout most of the profile. The resistivity and thickness increase sharply, but only in the NW sector, which is associated with the downward displaced block of the Guarrom\u00e1n Fault (Fig. 4A). In ERT profile 1, the Palaeozoic basement is not detected in the downward block of this fault; however, thanks to data from the nearby mechanical mining research boreholes (borehole 5), it is known to be 140\u00a0m deep (Fig. 4A).\n. The injection time in the ERT profile 2 is 256\u00a0ms, with a delay of 128\u00a0ms. In total, 2,565 measurements were taken. The final model has a RMS error of 13% reached in the 4th iteration. The geological structure deduced from ERT Profile 2 (Fig. 4B), and confirmed thanks to the different boreholes, is equivalent to that measured in ERT 1 profile. Thus, borehole 12 intersects the upper section of the Triassic facies, under which phyllites appear to be affected by an intense contact metamorphism, given the proximity to granite (the granite has been drilled in boreholes 13 and 14). ERT profile 2 also shows the abrupt sinking of the granite towards the NW, most likely caused by the \u201cAA Fault\u201d. Borehole 10 (Fig. 4B), located in a downward block according to this model, crosses a thick sequence of phyllites without any evidence of thermal metamorphism, up to 273\u00a0m of depth, where cuts a mineralised breccia associated with the \u201cAA Fault\u201d, and subsequently granite from the footwall block (ENADIMSA, unpublished technical reports). ERT 2 profile also shows the Guarrom\u00e1n Fault (Fig. 4B). Boreholes 8 and 9, in the downward displaced block of this second structure, intersect the phyllites of the Palaeozoic basement at 163 and 181\u00a0m, respectively.\n\n\n4.3\nTime-domain electromagnetic method\nIn each measurement station, the TDEM profile has been measured by varying the size (100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m or 200\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0m) and the configuration (single or centred) parameters of the loops, injection amperage, voltage and measurements. In each test, the ramp time is directly proportional to the size of the loop and the amperage (Christiansen et al., 2009). In this study, according to technical specifications of the equipment, the ramp time was 7 or 15\u00a0\u00b5s, depending on whether the injected amperage was 1 or 8 A (for 100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100-m loops) or 12\u00a0\u00b5s or 30\u00a0\u00b5s (for 200\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0m loops).\nThe first campaign was performed with a 100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m loop. This configuration makes it is possible to detect the contact between the Palaeozoic substrate and the sedimentary cover in the eastern sector (from station S1 to station S6bis, in Fig. 2A). For example, Fig. 5\n shows the curves generated in stations S2 and S6bis (Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B, respectively), plotting the induced voltage (blue line) and apparent resistivity (red line) as a function of time, as well as the resistivity model generated by the inversion software (thick red line). All curves show the fit between the field curve and the curve of the ZONDTEM1D software model. In both cases, the goodness of the curve fit stands out, with RMS errors of 1.0% and 1.4% (S2 and S6bis, respectively).\nThe curve of station S2 highlights an increase in the resistivity at a depth of approximately 35\u00a0m, which is correlated with the contact between the Triassic facies (sandstones and clays) and the Palaeozoic phyllites (Fig. 5A). The resistivity gradually increases, which could be due to the presence of intensely altered phyllites in the top of the Palaeozoic basement (in line with observations in the outcrops and in boreholes of the sector).\nThe curves resulting from the data collected in stations S3 to S6bis are very similar to one another and differ from those obtained in the previous stations (stations S1 and S2) due to the increase in the depth at which the higher resistivity associated with the basement is detected. Thus, in station S6bis (Fig. 5B), the contact between the sedimentary cover (Miocene\u00a0+\u00a0Triassic) and the Palaeozoic basement (phyllites) is estimated at approximately 140\u00a0m. This interpretation is consistent with the data provided by existing boreholes (5 in Fig. 1B and Table 1) or seismic profiles (Fig. 3). Therefore, the comparison of the different stations makes it possible to locate the Guarrom\u00e1n fault using this geophysical prospecting method.\nThe depth at which the basement is located in the eastern sector makes it necessary to repeat the electromagnetic prospecting campaign with a 200\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0200\u00a0m loop. For example, Fig. 5 shows the curves generated at station S10 (Fig. 5C). In this case, the goodness of the curve fit also stands out, with an RMS error of 1.3%. In the curve, an increase in the resistivity is detected from 250\u00a0m, which is associated with the contact between the Triassic sandstones and clays and the phyllites of the Palaeozoic basement. This depth correlates with that detected in borehole 4 (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2A and Table 1). The depths assessed in curves S7\/S8\/S9\/S10\/S11 and S12 are very similar. Therefore, comparing different stations makes it possible to detect an unmapped fracture, with approximately 90\u00a0m of throw, between stations S6bis and S7.\n\nFig. 5D shows the 2D section of resistivity obtained using the electromagnetic method, resulting from the combined inversion of the curves from thirteen individual stations using the ZondTEM2D software. In the SE sector, the Triassic unit (predominantly sandstone beds) and Palaeozoic phyllites have high resistivity values. The alteration of the top of the phyllites, as well as the associated decrease in resistivity, would allow for a weak differentiation between the two suites. Towards the NW, using this software the two fractures mentioned above are clearly detected and correlated with those identified in the seismic profile (Fig. 3). In turn, in the Bail\u00e9n Graben differences in the electrical behaviour between the Miocene unit and the Triassic top allow us to indicate the contact between the two suites. Thus, marl and marly limestones (Miocene) provide average resistivity values, in contrast to the low values of the clays from the upper section of the Triassic unit.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, different geophysical methods were combined to analyse the capacity of each method in modelling geological structures with mining implications. For this purpose, the old mining district of Linares-La Carolina (southeast of Spain), where PbS ores have been exploited, was chosen. More specifically, the western sector of the mining district was studied, where mining was limited by the presence of fractures.\nThree different geophysical techniques have been used: seismic reflection, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) methods. These geophysical techniques have been calibrated thanks to direct and available information, both from outcrop data and from mining research and groundwater boreholes. The seismic reflection profiles show abrupt changes in the wave amplitude associated with the sedimentary cover, as well as the acoustic basement associated with the Palaeozoic basement. Using this method, the fractures that displaces downward the eastern sector (Bail\u00e9n Graben) are detected, even indicating different fracturing stages. However, the method has not made it possible to differentiate phyllites and granitoids in this Palaeozoic substrate.\nTDEM is highly versatile and can be used with different configurations, amplitudes, voltages, time, device ranges and loop size, depending on the depth of study. In this study, the fit between the seismic and electromagnetic data was generally good. This method has made it possible to detect the depth of the Palaeozoic basement under the sedimentary cover, as well as different fractures.\nAt depths lower than 200\u00a0m, based on variations in the resistivity values, ERT profiles also identify the basement-sedimentary cover contact, as well as the different fractures. This technique even makes it possible to differentiate, within the basement, between the granite intrusion and the phyllites. This result has an evident mining importance because the metallised veins are associated with competent rocks (granitoids and metamorphic aureole), which quickly turn into waste rock when the host rock consists of phyllites.\nThe subsidence of the granite stock towards the east has been determined by the movement of a fault before the Triassic deposit, reducing the likelihood that well-metallised veins will be found in the Palaeozoic of the Bail\u00e9n graben towards the east of this structure.\n\n","70":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nPyrite is a common sulfide in multiple geological environments and can display a variety of morphological characteristics. For instance, early pyrite can be overgrown or replaced by later-stage pyrite to form complex zoning textures (Vel\u00e1squez et al., 2014). Previous studies have shown that complex pyrite can record valuable information about the physical and chemical evolution of the fluids from which it precipitated (Large et al., 2007; Large et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2008; Cook et al., 2009; Reich et al., 2013; Barker et al., 2009; Deditius et al., 2009; Vel\u00e1squez et al., 2018). Pyrite can contain economically valuable amounts of Au which can lead to formation of economic deposits. In pyrite, Au is commonly accompanied by other elements such as Ag, As, Cu, Sb, Hg, and Tl, especially in sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits (Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Reich et al., 2005; Large et al., 2009; Deditius et al., 2011; Reich et al., 2013). Advanced quantitative in situ LA-ICP-MS analysis can provide precise trace element compositions of pyrite with complex textures, and the compositions of multistage pyrite can be used to assess the ore fluid properties, ore-forming processes and provide insights on the source of gold (Large et al., 2007; Large et al., 2009; Large et al., 2011).\n\nReich et al. (2005) proposed that the maximum amount of Au that can be incorporated into pyrite is a function of the As concentration. Gold-bearing arsenian pyrite in different types of hydrothermal ore deposits, including Carlin-type Au (e.g., Cline, 2001; Emsbo et al., 2003), porphyry Cu, Cu\u2013Au, epithermal Au (e.g., Cook and Chryssoulis, 1990; Deditius et al., 2008), orogenic Au (e.g., Large et al., 2007; Moreyet al., 2008), and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VHMS; McClenaghan et al., 2004) deposits, suggests that Au and As usually display coupled geochemical behavior (Deditius et al., 2014). These types of ore deposits form under a wide range of physicochemical conditions. Arsenic solubility in fluids progrades as a result of increasing temperatures from 200 to 500\u00a0\u00b0C, resulting in a decrease in As concentrations in pyrite precipitated from the fluid (Deditius et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2019). Moreover, the Au concentration in pyrite can be affected by subsequent metamorphism and\/or alteration, the amounts of other trace elements, the size of individual grains, and the rapid crystallization of pyrite from a FeS2-supersaturated metal-rich fluid (e.g., Fleet and Mumin, 1997; Reich et al., 2006; Large et al., 2007; Deditius et al., 2008; Deditius et al., 2011; Masslennikov et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2021).\nIn this paper, we present detailed geochemical data on zoned pyrite in the Pangjiahe deposit in central China. Based on major and trace element associations and previously published sulfur isotope data (Ma et al., 2018), we try to further constrain the source of gold. In addition, the high As concentration but extremely low Au in the altered samples (0.1\u20131\u00a0g\/t Au, economically useless to the present) was contrary to the coupled geochemistry of Au and As proposed by previous studies. We explore the reason for the decoupling of Au and As in the Pangjiahe gold deposit and offer critical information for gold exploration in this region.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe Qinling orogen is a >1500\u00a0km-long multistage orogenic belt with three blocks and two sutures (Fig.\u00a01\nA; Meng and Zhang 2000; Ratschbacher et al., 2003). The Shangdan suture zone, which was formed in the Devonian, separates the North China block and the North Qinling terrane from the South Qinling terrane (Meng and Zhang 1999). The Triassic collision of the South China block with the South Qinling terrane along the Mianlue suture resulted in a widespread fold-thrust system and Triassic magmatism across the Qinling orogen (Zhang et al., 2001). The North Qinling terrane consists mainly of Proterozoic to Paleozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks (Li et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2001). The South Qinling terrane is predominantly composed of late Proterozoic to Triassic sediments overlying the Neoproterozoic basement. The Baoji-Chengdu railway has become an artificial border between the West Qinling Orogen (WQO) and the East Qinling orogen (EQO) in the South Qinling terrane. Numerous age data of Triassic magmatism indicate two episodes of magmatic activity: 227\u2013205\u00a0Ma granitoids, which are widely believed to have formed in a postcollisional extensional background (Zhang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2010a; Qin et al., 2010b; Cao et al., 2011), and \u223c245\u2013235\u00a0Ma granitoids (Feng et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2012), which should have formed in the early stage of a postcollisional setting when mountain building was still occurring (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2021).\nThe Fengtai Basin is one of five Devonian graben basins located in the eastern segment of the WQO (Fig. 1; Liu, 2001; Ji et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018). The WNW-striking Shangdan suture and Jiudianliang-Jiangkou fault form the northern and southern boundaries of the Fengtai Basin, respectively (Fig.\u00a01B). Parallel WNW-striking faults and complex fold systems are widely developed in the basin and can be attributed to the Triassic collision (Zhang, 2016; Fang et al., 2000). Minor N-S-striking faults crosscut the WNW-striking faults. The Hejiazhuang (246\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma, U-Pb zircon) and Xiba (215\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma, U-Pb zircon) plutons intruded separately into the Fengtai Basin during the two episodes of magmatism (Liu et al., 2011). Within the basin, the Middle Devonian Gudaoling Formation is predominantly composed of massive crystalline limestone with minor bioclasts. The Upper Devonian Xinhongpu Formation (Dx), Luohansi Formation (Dl) and Dacaotan Formation (Dd) mainly consist of calcareous-siliceous-argillaceous rocks. The rock combination of iron dolomitic phyllite, albite slate and albite in Dx has been thought to be a product of Devonian seafloor exhalation. They generally have much higher concentrations of trace elements; for instance, the iron dolomitic phyllite has concentrations of 21.27\u00a0ppb Au, 270\u00a0ppb Ag, 42.29\u00a0ppm Cu, 58.39\u00a0ppm Pb, 97.75\u00a0ppm Zn, 27.07\u00a0ppm As, 2.28\u00a0ppm Sb, and 99.32\u00a0ppm B, which are higher than the background concentrations (3.95\u00a0ppb, 79\u00a0ppb, 27.15\u00a0ppm, 27.24\u00a0ppm, 81.22\u00a0ppm, 4.68\u00a0ppm, 0.97\u00a0ppm, 77.02\u00a0ppm, respectively) (Lu et al., 1999). The \u03b434S values of the sedimentary-exhalative (SEDEX) Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn deposits are enriched in 34S (mainly 8\u201310\u2030). Sulfur is widely accepted to have precipitated via thermal sulfate reduction from the Devonian seawater (Ma et al., 2018 and reference therein). This indicates that the seafloor sedimentary exhalative process brought these elements to the specific Devonian sequence in the WQO.\nMore than 200\u00a0t Au and 5\u00a0Mt Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn have been discovered in the Fengtai Basin (Wang et al., 2007; Li, 2008). The SEDEX Pb\u00a0+\u00a0Zn mineralization and alteration are located at the boundary between Middle and Upper Devonian sediments, and gold deposits are hosted in structures in the upper layers of the Upper Devonian sediments (Lu et al., 1999; Liu, 2001; Li et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). The Pangjiahe gold deposit is located on the northwestern margin of the basin (Fig.\u00a01B), and gold mineralization occurred within the gap between two episodes of magmatism when the tectonic setting transformed from regional compression to transpression (ca. 230\u00a0Ma, Ma et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nPangjiahe gold deposit\nThe Pangjiahe deposit, which has proven reserves of 38\u00a0t Au at an average grade of 6.3\u00a0g\/t (Mao et al., 2002), is an orogenic gold deposit located 15\u00a0km north of Feng County in Shaanxi Province, China. Gold mineralization is predominantly hosted in the Dd Formation (Fig. 2\n), which locally consists of pyrite-bearing phyllite and sandstone. The Dd sedimentary rocks were weakly metamorphosed to subgreenschist facies during the Triassic orogeny (Xu et al., 1995). Quaternary sediments are widely distributed and are thick (1\u201330\u00a0m) in this area. The east-striking Pangjiahe anticline, with an axial plane dip angle from less than 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0), which has five east-oriented faults parallel to the axial plane, formed during the Triassic orogeny (Fig. 2; Quan et al., 1995; Quan, 1996). The five east-striking faults are coupled with five east-striking gold ore bodies (I to V) cropping out at the surface (Fig. 2). The sixth ore body (VI) is exposed only at mine levels below 1050\u00a0m (Fig.\u00a03\nB). The ore bodies range between 170 and 360\u00a0m along strike and are 0.1\u201312.5\u00a0m thick. The altered and\/or mineralized faults dip to the north above the 1348\u00a0m level, are near-vertical between the 1348\u00a0m and 1279\u00a0m levels, and finally dip to the south (Fig.\u00a02A) at a high angle (175\u00b0, 65\u00b0S; Fig.\u00a03B).\nTwo stages of magmatic activity coupled with two regional episodes of granitoid formation have been recognized in the Pangjiahe deposit. The early-stage Liushagou granite stock (situated 500\u00a0m west of the deposit) and granite porphyry dikes formed at 239.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma and 240.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0Ma (U-Pb zircon), respectively (Ma et al., 2018). Diabase dikes also occur mainly east of the Xiaoyu River; they were dated by U-Pb on zircon at 219.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0Ma (Ma et al., 2018). These dikes normally share the same structure or are parallel to the gold orebodies (Figs. 2 and 3) and may be locally mineralized to 4\u00a0g\/t Au when they are close to the ore-hosting structures. The diabase dikes have sharp contacts with the host rocks and consistently crosscut the ore bodies. Hence, the ca. 230\u00a0Ma gold mineralization age, based on hydrothermal zircon U-Pb and sericite Ar-Ar dating (Ma et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2021), is solid and reliable.\nPhyllite is the main ore mined in the Pangjiahe deposit. Ores are easily distinguishable from wall rocks because the altered and mineralized phyllite appears bleached compared to the primary phyllite wall rock (Fig.\u00a04\nA\u2013C). Auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite predominantly occur as sulfide veins that are parallel to foliation in the phyllite (Fig.\u00a04C). Mineralized granite porphyry dikes are usually in fault contact with phyllite ore (Fig.\u00a04D, E), and auriferous quartz veins normally hosted in faults (Fig.\u00a04D) or crosscut both ores (Fig.\u00a04E). Quartz and K-feldspar phenocrysts can be observed in granite porphyry when it is slightly altered (Fig.\u00a04F). Hydrothermal alteration is dominated by silicification and sericitization, and the pyrite-quartz-sericite combination is common and universal in the deposit.\nPyrite is common in both the ores and wall rocks. Based on detailed observations under the microscope and sulfur isotope characteristics (Ma et al., 2018), pyrite from different host rocks can be classified into 4 stages. Py0 is the earliest pyrite disseminated in the phyllite and sandstones. Py0 normally occurs as euhedral granular grains with diameters of 50\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcm. The Py0 grains are always replaced (Fig.\u00a05\nA, B) or overgrown (Fig.\u00a05B) by later-stage Py2. Considering the wide range of \u03b434S values (\u22121.5\u2030 to +9.4\u2030), Py0 has been interpreted as diagenetic in origin (Ma et al., 2018). Py1 can be observed in granite porphyry as disseminated pyrite (Fig.\u00a05C, D), and it occurs as euhedral granular grains with diameters of 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm. Py2 commonly replaces Py1 in altered granite porphyry (Fig.\u00a05C, D). By analyzing its \u03b434S values (mainly between 2\u2030 and 5\u2030), Ma et al. (2018) proposed a magmatic hydrothermal origin for Py1. Py2 is the most common sulfide in the Pangjiahe deposit and can be widely observed in mineralized phyllites, sandstone, granite porphyry and auriferous quartz veins. It normally occurs as pyrite rims with widths of 20\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm that replace or overgrow early-stage Py0 and Py1 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013D) or as disseminated pyrite in auriferous quartz veins (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Free gold and arsenopyrite inclusions can be observed in Py2 (Fig.\u00a05F) or in the boundaries between Py2 and Py3 (Fig.\u00a05A, E), indicating that Py2 is associated with the main ore stage with high amounts of Au and As. Free gold also occurs as singular crystals in silicates (Fig.\u00a05E) but is spatially related to Py2. Py3 is the outer rim that occasionally replaces Py2 (Fig.\u00a05A, C, D). Py3 can be anhedral to euhedral, with widths of 10\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm. Py2 and Py3 in all types of host rocks have similar \u03b434S values (mainly between 8\u2030 and 10\u2030) and have been interpreted as being associated with hydrothermal ore stages (Ma et al., 2018).\n\n\n4\nSampling and methodology\nSamples were collected from underground work areas and drill holes, predominantly around the exploration sections of 37, 25, 11, and 16. Mineralized and altered samples were chosen to evaluate the decoupling of Au and As and to assess the gold mineralization process in different rocks. The altered samples (0.1\u20131\u00a0g\/t) were generally collected distal to the ore-controlling faults, which is close to the mine side of the alteration boundary. Sample descriptions are summarized in Table 1\n.\n\n4.1\nEMPA mapping\nSelected samples (80BCM37-5) and standards were analyzed by a JXA-8100 Superprobe electron microprobe (EMP) at the Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (GPMR), China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). Standards and samples were analyzed by EMP analysis using a beam diameter of 1\u00a0\u03bcm, an accelerating voltage of 20\u00a0kV, and a beam current of 20nA. The standards, spectral lines, and detection limits (ppm) for each element are as follows: Fe (FeS2, K\u03b1, 129), S (FeS2, K\u03b1, 56), As (GaAs, L\u03b1, 224) and Au (Au, L\u03b1, 247). The accuracy and precision were better than 3% based on replicate analyses of standards.\n\n\n4.2\nLA-ICP-MS trace element analyses\nPyrite grains were etched with sodium hypochlorite with 6\u201314% active chlorine to reveal their internal textures (Sykore et al., 2018). Then, the trace element compositions of pyrite were analyzed at the LA-ICP-MS facility at the University of Tasmania, Australia, using a 213\u00a0nm solid-state laser microprobe (UP213, NewWave Research) coupled to an Agilent 7500a quadruple mass spectrometer. The beam diameter for spot analyses of pyrite was 29\u00a0\u03bcm, and two thin Py2 rims were analyzed with a beam diameter of 19\u00a0\u03bcm. The laser repetition rate was typically 5\u00a0Hz, and the laser beam energy at the sample was maintained at 2.7\u00a0J\/cm2. The analysis time for each spot was 90\u00a0s, comprising a 30\u00a0s measurement of background (laser off) and a 60\u00a0s analysis of the sample (laser on). The analyses were carried out in an atmosphere of pure He, which was introduced into the cell at a rate of 0.8\u00a0L\/min. To improve aerosol transport, 0.85\u00a0L\/min of Ar was mixed with the He carrier gas. The calibration standards STDGL3, GSD-1G, and PeruPy (Belousov et al., 2015) were analyzed twice between every set of 26 unknown analyses and between each sample change. The detection limits for Co59, Ni60, Cu65, Zn66, As75, Ag107, Sb121, Au197, Tl205, Pb208, and Bi209, which were selected for the following discussion, were generally 0.01, 0.01, 0.76, 0.42, 3.58, 6.75, 0.004, 0.01, 0.05, 0.21, 0.007, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.002\u00a0ppm, respectively. However, these values could be slightly variable for each spot. The results are presented in Table 1.\nThe trace element mapping of pyrite in ores (2016BCM25-1-1, 2016BCM25-1-3, 2015BCM25-3-2, and 20BCM 25-1-2) was performed under similar conditions, except that an 11\u00a0\u03bcm spot size and a 10\u00a0Hz pulse rate were used. Instead of individual spot locations, a series of parallel lines were ablated at a speed of 11\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. The detailed process for creating a trace element map can be found in Steadman et al. (2013). The trace element mapping of pyrite in altered samples (BZK16-2-1 and BZK11-1-5) was performed at the Ore Deposit and Exploration Centre (ODEC), School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, China, using a laser ablation system (PhotonMachines Analyte HE with 193-nm ArF Excimer) coupled to a quadrupole-based ICP-MS (Agilent 7900). The detailed analysis and imaging process can be found in Wang et al. (2017).\n\n\n\n5\nResults and discussion\n\n5.1\nPyrite major and trace element zonation\nEMPA of the pyrite (Fig. 6\n) in the highly mineralized phyllite reveals strong zonation, with gray anhedral Py0 in the core and brighter Py2 in the rim in backscatter electron (BSE) images (Fig.\u00a06A). Iron generally remains constant in pyrite and arsenopyrite (Fig.\u00a06B). The high sulfur concentration zones coincide to Py0, and the lower zones match Py2 very well (Fig.\u00a06C). In zoned pyrite, sulfur and arsenic are negatively correlated (Fig.\u00a06C, D). Furthermore, arsenopyrite (Fig.\u00a06D) and free Au (Fig.\u00a06E) occur as inclusions or independent crystals in and around Py2.\nIn the mineralized phyllite (Fig.\u00a07\nA; Appendix A), LA-ICP-MS mapping of zoned pyrite shows that Py2 is the main hydrothermal ore-stage pyrite, contains several hundred ppm Au, and has the highest Ni, Cu, As, Ag, and Sb contents. Py3 has lower Au, Ni, Cu, As, Ag, and Sb contents than Py2, indicating that it represents late ore-stage pyrite. Therefore, the transition from Py2 to Py3 precipitation should represent the natural evolution of the same ore fluid from the main ore stage to the late ore stage. The similar \u03b434S value ranges of Py2 (+7\u2030 to 11\u2030) and Py3 (+7.3\u2030 to 11.8\u2030) also indicate that the two stages of pyrite had the same sulfur source and precipitated from ore fluids with similar properties (Ma et al., 2018). In other words, the in situ trace elements and \u03b434S analysis yield the same results and corroborate each other in this study. Py0 is enriched in Co and has low concentrations of Ni, Cu, and As. However, Au and Ag are absent in Py0. In the altered phyllite (Fig.\u00a07B; Appendix B, C), Co, Ni, Cu, As, Ag, and Sb display the same geochemical behavior, and the zoned pyrite in the altered phyllite has similar concentrations of these elements as that in the mineralized phyllite. However, in terms of Au concentration, the hydrothermal ore-stage Py2 and Py3 in altered phyllite are comparable to the diagenetic Py0 (with concentrations generally less than 1\u00a0ppm).\nIn the granite porphyry (Fig. 8\n), Py1 is enriched in Co, Ni, and As (to some extent), which is consistent with the features of magmatic hydrothermal pyrite (Sykore et al., 2018 and references therein). Copper, As, Ag, and Sb are also highly enriched in Py2 and have the same concentrations in both mineralized (Fig.\u00a08A) and altered (Fig.\u00a08B) granite porphyry. Moreover, sulfosalt minerals enriched in Cu and Ag occur as inclusions in Py2. However, in the altered granite porphyry, Au is one order of magnitude lower than that in the mineralized granite porphyry. In general, there are few differences in metal precipitation behavior of ore-stage pyrite between the phyllite and granite porphyry rocks. Unlike pyrite in Carlin\/Carlin-like deposits, thallium (Tl) is not present in any stage of pyrite in the Pangjiahe deposit (Figs. 7 and 8).\nThe spot analysis of Py2 in altered samples (BZK11-1-5, BZK16-2-1, and 2015BCM25-3-2) have low gold content between <0.001 and 0.882\u00a0ppm, with an average at 0.167\u00a0ppm. The average value of As, Sb, Cu, and Ag are 40,661.7\u00a0ppm, 1430.8\u00a0ppm, 1266.9\u00a0ppm, and 23.1\u00a0ppm, respectively. The spot analysis of Py2 in mineralized samples (2016BCM25-1-1 and 2016BCM25-1-3) have high gold content between 17.9 and 330.5\u00a0ppm, with an average at 142.7\u00a0ppm, which is 2\u20135 orders of magnitude higher than the altered samples. However, the average value of As, Sb, Cu, and Ag are comparable to the altered samples at 43,720\u00a0ppm, 639\u00a0ppm, 103\u00a0ppm, and 20.1\u00a0ppm, respectively.\n\n\n5.2\nDecoupling of gold and arsenic in arsenian pyrite\nArsenic is the most common element that has been reported in pyrite. As1- has been widely accepted as the main species and can have a concentration as high as 19\u00a0wt% in pyrite (Simon et al., 1999; Savage et al., 2000; Reich et al., 2005). The EMPA spot analyses show that As in all stages of pyrite varies from less than 0.024\u00a0wt% to 8.7\u00a0wt%, and sulfur has a strong negative correlation with As (Ma et al., 2018; Fig.\u00a06C, D). LA-ICP-MS spot analysis shows that the As concentrations vary from 8.4\u00a0ppm to 110,534.5\u00a0ppm, with an average of 26,539.1\u00a0ppm, in all stages of pyrite (Table 1). Py2 has the highest As concentration, varying from 2269.7\u00a0ppm to 110,534.5\u00a0ppm, with an average of 44,240.5\u00a0ppm (Table 1). The high As content and relatively low sulfur content in Py2 (Fig.\u00a06D) may indicate that sulfur has been substituted by As1-, which is favorable for other trace elements to enter the Py2 structure (Fleet et al., 1993; Reich et al., 2005).\nIn different types of gold deposits, Au has been observed as solid solution (Au+) and\/or free gold (Au0) in arsenian pyrite (Fleet et al., 1993; Reich et al., 2005; Su et al., 2008; Large et al., 2009). Reich et al. (2005) summarized the empirical equation (CAu\u00a0=\u00a00.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CAs\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-5) which marks the limit of gold dissolved in arsenian pyrite within a temperature range between \u223c150 and 250\u00a0\u00b0C. Generally, it has been well established that an increase in the As concentration can promote the incorporation of Au in pyrite. The increase in As in pyrite could form either an Fe-deficient surface (Johan et al., 1989; Fleet and Mumin, 1997; Reich et al., 2005) or a locally reducing surface, thus causing the destabilization of Au-sulfide complexes and Au deposition (Pokrovski et al., 2002). Arsenic likely facilitates the incorporation of Au in pyrite, which can explain the coupled geochemical behavior of Au and As in different types of hydrothermal ore deposits (Deditius et al., 2014; Pokrovski et al., 2021).\nIn the Pangjiahe deposit, mineralized phyllite shows a positive correlation between Au and As in zoned pyrite. Py0 in the core has 1.2\u00a0ppm Au and 1529\u00a0ppm As (Fig.\u00a09\nA). Py2 has the highest Au (82.1\u00a0ppm) and As (71,409\u00a0ppm) contents, and Au (8.5\u00a0ppm) and As (17,586\u00a0ppm) contents are sharply decreased in Py3. However, the extremely low Au concentration in the zoned pyrite in the altered phyllite shows decoupling of Au and As (Fig.\u00a09B), with the highest As content (110,534\u00a0ppm) but a low Au content (0.027\u00a0ppm) in Py2. The Au content is lower than that in Py0 (0.121\u00a0ppm), which has the lowest As content (85\u00a0ppm). The spot analysis results are consistent with the mapping results (Fig.\u00a09C, D), which show high As contents in Py2 and Py3, but Au contents are comparable with those of Py0. Py2 in the granite porphyry displays the same decoupling behavior, with 62,344\u00a0ppm As and 134.6\u00a0ppm Au in the mineralized one (Fig.\u00a09E) and 46,346\u00a0ppm As and 0.617\u00a0ppm Au in the altered one (Fig.\u00a09F). In the Au-As scatter diagram, two trends of correlation are present (Fig.\u00a010\nA). The arrow shows a positive correlation, but 9 of 44 spots in the black dashed circle are isolated from the positive trend and the coupled geochemical zone of Au and As (red dashed circle, Deditius et al., 2014). Unlike Au, Cu, Sb, and Ag are enriched in both the mineralized and altered phyllite and the granite porphyry, and these elements are roughly positively correlated with As (Fig.\u00a010B, C, D).\nIn most geologic settings, arsenic can facilitate the incorporation of Au in pyrite (Deditius et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2019). However, the degree of Au incorporation can be affected by subsequent metamorphism and\/or alteration, the amounts of other trace elements, the size of individual grains, and the rapid crystallization of pyrite from a FeS2-supersaturated metal-rich fluid (Fleet and Mumin, 1997; Reich et al., 2006; Large et al., 2007; Deditius et al., 2008; Deditius et al., 2011a; Masslennikov et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2021). Whether these processes are responsible for the decoupling of Au and As in the hydrothermal ore-stage Py2 and Py3 in the Pangjiahe deposit is discussed individually. Py2 and later Py3 have no deformation textures, and no quartz pressure shadows are observed, excluding the influence of subsequent metamorphism. The amounts of other trace elements, including As, Sb, Cu, and Ag, in Py2 are comparable (within the same order of magnitude) (Figs. 7\u20139; Table 1 and Appendix) in both mineralized and altered samples. Therefore, this cannot explain the 2\u20135 orders of magnitude lower Au content in Py2 in the altered samples. Rim and fine-grained pyrite textures have larger surface areas than coarse-grained pyrite and are more favorable for gold deposition. However, Py2 normally occurs as rim or fine-grained pyrite in both mineralized and altered samples (Figs. 5\u20139 and Appendix). Hence, the size of individual grains can also be excluded. The rapid crystallization of pyrite from a FeS2-supersaturated fluid would generally lead to pyrite with a porous texture and nanoscale size. Moreover, the \u03b434S value would have strong variation since this process occurs in a disequilibrium environment where fluid boiling and oxidation may occur. However, the narrow range of \u03b434S values in rim pyrite also exclude this possible explanation.\nHence, subsequent alteration may play an important role in the decoupling of Au and As in the Pangjiahe deposit. Su et al. (2009) analyzed the fluid inclusions of Carlin-type gold deposits in Guizhou, China. Pyrites display similar zoning textures, with high As (>9000\u00a0ppm) and Au (>100\u00a0ppm) rims (Su et al., 2008; Su et al., 2012). Their analyses reveal that the Au (\u22647.8\u00a0ppm) and As (\u2264340\u00a0ppm) contents in the early ore-stage fluid were relatively high (Su et al., 2009). The Au content (\u22640.8\u00a0ppm) in the ore fluid is approximately one order of magnitude lower after massive precipitation of arsenian pyrite. However, no significant changes are observed in As, Sb, Cu, and Ag concentrations in fluid inclusions across all stages despite the precipitation of arsenopyrite (Su et al., 2009; Su et al., 2012). This may explain the positive correlation of Au and As in the mineralized samples at Pangjiahe deposit (sufficient ore fluid with enough gold) but the decoupling in the altered samples (the fluid alteration boundary without the continuous charging of gold but relatively constant supply of other elements). The altered samples with low gold grades (0.1\u20130.8\u00a0g\/t) were generally collected distal to the ore-controlling fault that is away from the fluid center. In this area, the ore fluid may not have charged in time, which had a strong impact on the Au concentration but not on the concentrations of other elements. The decoupling of Au and As (Sb, Cu, and Ag) at the boundary between ore and wall rocks may contribute to finding the right fingerprint elements during geochemical exploration in this area. Instead of using Au directly, the combination of As, Sb, Cu, and Ag may be helpful to find distal anomalies related to gold mineralization.\n\n\n5.3\nSource of gold in the Pangjiahe deposit\nThe source of gold in the sedimentary-hosted gold deposits in the WQO has two distinct possibilities: Triassic magma (Yin, 2011; Feng et al., 2003; Lei, 2011) or Paleozoic sediments and Precambrian basement (Qi and Li, 1993; Lu et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018). In the Pangjiahe deposit, the gold mineralization age is ca. 230\u00a0Ma (Ma et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2021), which is 10\u00a0Ma younger than the granitic rocks in or around the deposit. The \u03b434S values of ore-stage Py2 and Py3 (mainly between 8\u2030 and 10\u2030; Ma et al., 2018) are far from those of typical magmatic sulfur (normally \u22125 to +5\u2030; Ohmoto, 1986) and magmatic hydrothermal-stage Py1 (mainly between 2\u2030 and 5\u2030; Ma et al., 2018). Moreover, ore-stage Py2 and Py3 are generally enriched in Au, As, Sb, Cu, Ag and minor Ni, which is different from pyrite precipitated from high-temperature magmatic hydrothermal fluid (enriched in Co, Ni, and minor As, Sykore et al., 2018 and references therein). Additionally, only a small number of granitoids with similar formation age with gold mineralization (ca. 230\u00a0Ma) have been reported in the WQO (Qin et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2012). Hence, Triassic magma does not seem to be the gold source in the Pangjiahe deposit.\nThe \u03b434S values of gold deposits, including the Pangjiahe deposit, in and around the Devonian basins in the WQO typically have narrow and positive ranges between +8\u2030 and +14\u2030 (Ma et al., 2018 and reference therein), which are consistent with global Devonian sediment-hosted orogenic gold deposit range (11.1\u2030 to 13.3\u2030) proposed by Chang et al. (2008). This indicates that the Devonian sediments other than the whole Paleozoic sediments and Precambrian basement could be the possible gold source. By comparing the high concentrations of Au, As, Sb, Cu, and Ag in the ore-stage pyrite in the Pangjiahe deposit (Fig.\u00a07A, Fig.\u00a08A, Fig.\u00a09A, E, Fig. 10 and Appendix A), it appears that the Devonian seafloor exhalation sequence in the Fengtai basin, which is enriched in Au, As, Cu, Sb, Ag, etc., and has similar high and positive \u03b434S values (Lu et al., 1999; Liu, 2001; Li et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011), was a possible source of the gold in the Pangjiahe deposit. The Early Triassic orogeny and metamorphism extracted sulfur, gold, arsenic and other trace elements from the Devonian seafloor exhalation sequence, and gold precipitated during the transformation of the tectonic setting from regional compression to transpression at ca. 230\u00a0Ma (Ma et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe LA-ICP-MS spot analysis and mapping of pyrite in mineralized and altered samples indicate two Au and As relationships. In the mineralized samples, Au has a strong positive correlation with As, similar to other arsenian pyrites in different types of deposits around the world. However, in the altered samples (distal to the ore fluid center), ore-stage Py2, which has the same level of As but 2\u20135 orders of magnitude lower Au, shows decoupled Au and As geochemical behavior. This may be because the ore fluid reaction to the altered samples did not have enough continuously charged gold. Considering the similarities of \u03b434S values (8\u2030 and 10\u2030) and trace element enrichment (Au, As, Sb, Cu, and Ag), metamorphism of the Devonian seafloor exhalation sequence in the Fengtai Basin during the Triassic orogeny should be cited as the main gold source in the Pangjiahe deposit.\n\n","71":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe East Kunlun orogenic belt (EKOB) in western China is a multi-cycle composite orogenic belt with complex evolution history (Yin and Zhang, 1997), which records two stages of orogenesis that are related to the early Paleozoic Proto-Tethyan Ocean and the late Paleozoic to the early Mesozoic Paleo-Tethyan Ocean (Yang et al., 1996, 2004; Bian et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018a, 2018b; Yu et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2020). Moreover, the EKOB is also a giant magmatic belt that can compare favorably with the Gangdese belt (Mo et al., 2007). The magmatism related to these two orogeneses in the EKOB mainly occurred in two periods: (1) Cambrian-Devonian (515\u2013380\u00a0Ma; Dong et al., 2018a, 2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Yu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022) and (2) Permian-Triassic (278\u2013200\u00a0Ma; Chen et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2020; Kamaunji et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2020). The two intense tectonic-magmatic activities resulted in favorable metallogenic geological conditions in the EKOB. So far, different types of deposits related to magmatism have been found in the EKOB, such as magmatic sulfide deposits (e.g., Xiarihamu and Kaimuqi; Song et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019), porphyry-skarn Cu-Pb-Zn deposits (e.g., Hutouya, Shiduolong and Saishitang; Wang et al., 2016, 2018a, 2018b; Qu et al., 2019), Ag-polymetallic deposits (e.g., Nagengkangqieergou; Chen et al., 2020b), and greisen-skarn W-Sn deposits (e.g., Baiganhu, Kekekaerde, and Bashierxi; Gao et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2018). Moreover, the EKOB is also an important gold metallogenic province in China (Deng and Wang, 2016) and has discovered numerous gold deposits representing by the Dachang (>121\u00a0t Au; Zhang et al., 2015), Wulonggou (>70\u00a0t Au; Zhang et al., 2017) and Gouli (>110\u00a0t Au; Chen et al., 2020c) gold deposits. Some studies, including geological characteristics, fluid inclusions, isotopic compositions, and timing of gold mineralization, have been carried out on these gold deposits of the EKOB, and these gold deposits are considered to be similar to the orogenic gold deposits (Zhang et al., 2001; Feng et al., 2004; Ding et al. 2013a; Ding et al., 2013b; Wei et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020c). However, the timing of gold mineralization and the sources of ore-forming fluid and materials (e.g., sulfur and lead) are still controversial. In previous studies, Ar-Ar dating of ore-related hydrothermal sericite\/muscovite and Rb-Sr isochron dating of fluid inclusions in quartz yielded the mineralization time of the late Triassic (237\u2013202\u00a0Ma; Zhang et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019a), while the pyrite Re-Os dating revealed the gold mineralization event in the middle Devonian-early Carboniferous (383\u2013349\u00a0Ma; Chen et al., 2020c). Obviously, these two groups of age data are consistent with the orogenic events of the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic and the early Paleozoic, respectively, and are close to the time of the two episodes of regional magmatism mentioned above. Combined with the isotopic studies of hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur and osmium, some researchers concluded that the ore-forming fluids and materials were mainly derived from magma (Zhang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020c). However, in some ore districts, such as Dachang, there are no records of magmatic activities. Therefore, other researchers highlighted that the host sedimentary rocks play a critical role in providing ore-forming fluids and materials (S, As, Au and other metals) during the gold mineralization (Ding et al., 2013a; Zhai et al., 2021). The possible reasons for the above different understandings include: (1) the control of gold mineralization by multi-stage tectonic-magmatic activities, (2) the heterogeneous distribution of magmatism in the EKOB and (3) contribution of different sources (magmas and\/or sedimentary rocks) to the gold mineralization.\nThe Kunlun River area in the East Kunlun is an advantageous metallogenic region for gold, copper, and polymetallic deposits in Qinghai Province. As so far, some small gold deposits, such as Heicigou, Dazaohuo and Heihainan, have been discovered in this area. These gold deposits not only share common geological characteristics in ore type, ore-controlling structure, mineral assemblage and wall rock alteration but also have a similar metallogenic setting. However, there are some differences in the formation time and lithology of their host rocks. Although several gold deposits are distributed in the Kunlun River area, the studies about these gold deposits are limited due to the harsh geographical environment. In this paper, some new geological and geochemical data are presented to document the geological characteristics of these deposits and ascertain the source of metal and ore fluid and the genesis of gold deposits. Meanwhile, zircons from the auriferous quartz veins are used to define the timing of gold mineralization. Finally, the genetic relationships between gold deposits and regional tectonic evolution are discussed.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nThe EW-trending East Kunlun orogenic belt (EKOB), approximately 1500\u00a0km long and 50\u00a0\u223c\u00a0200\u00a0km wide, is situated between the Qaidam Block to the north and the Bayan Har (BH)-Songpan-Ganze (SG) Terrane to the south, with the Qinling orogenic belt and the Altyn Tagn fault on its east and west sides, respectively (Fig. 1\na). Separated by the North and Central Kunlun faults, the EKOB can be divided into the Northern Kunlun (NKL), the central Kunlun (CKL), and the Southern Kunlun (SKL) from north to south (Fig. 1b; Yang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008; Song et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016). The NKL is composed of the Precambrian metamorphic rocks and the early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks intruded by the early Ordovician to late Triassic igneous rocks (Ding et al., 2014; He et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). The CKL is characterized by widespread Proterozoic metamorphic basement rocks comprising high- and medium-grade metamorphic rocks of the Jinshuikou Group and epimetamorphic carbonate rocks of the Binggou Group, as well as the Paleozoic to Mesozoic granites (He et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016). The SKL consists of metamorphic volcanic-sedimentary rocks of the Mesoproterozoic Kuhai and Wanbaogou Groups that are overlain by the early Cambrian to Jurassic clastic, carbonate, and volcanic rocks (Jiang et al., 1992; Yuan et al., 2009; Meng et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2015). Paleozoic and Mesozoic granitic intrusions also occur in the SKL (Song et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017).\nThe Kunlun River area is located in the central part of the EKOB (Fig. 1b) and sandwiched between the Central and South Kunlun faults (Fig. 1c). The strata exposed in the Kunlun River area are mainly the Meso- to Neo-Proterozoic Wanbaogou Group and the Middle-Upper Ordovician Naij Tal Group. The Wanbaogou Group is dominated by low-grade metamorphosed basalt, andesite and carbonates interbedded with clastic, while the Naij Tal Group predominantly comprises basaltic andesite, dacite and rhyolite with island-arc affinity, as well as pyroclastic rocks and turbidites interbedded with minor limestones (Jiang et al., 1992; Pan et al., 1996; Chen et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2018a). The distribution of other Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata is restricted. Except for the Ordovician Naij Tal Group, the early Paleozoic strata also include metaclastic rocks of the Lower Cambrian Shasongwula Formation (Jin et al., 2020). The Upper Paleozoic succession comprises metaclastic and volcanic rocks of the Lower Carboniferous Halaguole Formation, sedimentary and volcanic clastic rocks of the Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian Haoteluowa Formation, as well as clastic and volcanic rocks of the Upper Permian Ma\u2019erzheng Formation (Yin and Pan, 2008; Ren et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2016; Pei et al., 2015, 2017; Yu et al., 2020). The Triassic strata, unconformably overlying the Paleozoic strata, are mainly composed of synorogenic clastic rocks of conglomerate and coarse lithic sandstone interbedded with limestone (Wu et al., 2019), including the Lower Triassic Hongshuichuan Formation (Yan et al., 2008; Li et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2019), the Lower-Middle Triassic Naocangjiangou and Changmahe Formations (Chen, 2015; Yu et al., 2020), the Middle Triassic Xilikete Formation (Cai et al., 2008) and the Upper Triassic Babaoshan Formation (Mo et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2018a).\nThe regional tectonic framework is characterized by a series of predominantly NW- to NWW-trending faults (Fig. 1b). The Central and South Kunlun faults are two important boundary faults in this area. The Central Kunlun fault, formed in the early Paleozoic (Meng et al., 2013), is characterized by ductile thrust deformation during the late Caledonian and subsequent dextral ductile strike-slip shearing in the Hercynian-Indochina (Wang et al., 1999, 2003; Li et al., 2014a; Li et al., 2015b). The South Kunlun fault is a large sinistral strike-slip fault related to the oblique subduction of the Bayan Har-Songpan-Garze Terrane beneath the East Kunlun Terrane in the Triassic (Xu et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2005; Feng et al., 2017). The Kunlun River ductile shear zone, formed between ca. 432 and 423\u00a0Ma, is a newly recognized large ductile shear zone in the Kunlun River area, representing the tectonic response to the collisional orogeny in the middle-late Silurian between the North and South Kunlun blocks after the closing of the Proto-Tethyan Ocean (Gu et al., 2018).\nMiddle Silurian to early Jurassic magmatic rocks are widely distributed on both sides of the Kunlun River and consist of granite, granodiorite, and minor gabbro with zircon U-Pb ages varying from 433 to 196\u00a0Ma (Fig. 1c). These magmatic rocks dominantly occurred as stocks or apophyses and were emplaced into the Wanbaogou and Naij Tal Groups. Geochronologically, these intrusive rocks can be divided into three groups: middle to late Silurian (433\u2013421\u00a0Ma), early Devonian (418\u2013398\u00a0Ma) and late Triassic to early Jurassic (211\u2013196\u00a0Ma).\n\n\n3\nGeological characteristics of typical gold deposits\n\n3.1\nHeicigou gold deposit\nThe Heicigou gold deposit is located about 10\u00a0km to the south of the Central Kunlun fault (Fig. 1c). Lithologies in Heicigou mainly include the Proterozoic Wanbaogou Group, the Ordovician Naij Tal Group, and the Triassic Hongshuichuan and Naocangjiangou Formations (Fig. 2\na). The Cambrian Shasongwula Formation is locally exposed in the northeast of the ore district. The NW-trending F1 fault is the main ore controlling structure and crosscut by the NE-trending F4 fault. The early Devonian granodiorite, emplaced at 405.5\u00a0Ma, is locally exposed to the south of the ore district and intruded into the Naij Tal Group as apophyses.\nExploration has delineated three ore zones (M\u2160, M\u2161, and MIII) and nine lenticular or podiform Au orebodies (Fig. 2). The ore zones are mainly hosted by the tuffaceous phyllite of the Ordovician Naij Tal Group and clastic rock of the early Triassic Hongshuichuan Formation. Ore zones M\u2160 and MII are located in the north of the deposit (Fig. 2b). The M\u2160 ore zone is 4\u00a0km long and 60 to 300\u00a0m wide, with a strike of 290\u00b0 and a dip varying from 55\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 to the south (Fig. 2d). Five Au orebodies within the M\u2160 ore zone are about 80 to 240\u00a0m long and 1.1 to 5.6\u00a0m wide, with an average grade of 1.45 to 3.63\u00a0g\/t. The MII ore zone, about 800\u00a0m long and 3 to 11\u00a0m wide, is located 150\u00a0m to the south of the M\u2160 ore zone. It consists of two Au orebodies with a length of about 80\u00a0m, a width of 1.8 to 4.0\u00a0m, and an average grade of 1.74 to 3.40\u00a0g\/t. MIII ore zone at the southwest end of the deposit is approximately 1\u00a0km long and 10 to 50\u00a0m wide and includes two Au orebodies (MIII-1 and MIII-2; Fig. 2c). The average grades of these two orebodies are 5.43\u00a0g\/t and 1.13\u00a0g\/t, respectively. It is worth noting that the MIII ore zone is accompanied by copper, lead, zinc, and silver mineralization.\nThe orebodies at Heicigou consist of auriferous quartz veins and adjacent disseminated ores in the altered wall rocks (Fig. 3\na). Mineral assembles are relatively simple. Sulfides are less than 5% and are dominated by pyrite, with minor amounts of arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite. Gangue minerals are mainly quartz and calcite. Hydrothermal alterations at Heicigou include silicification, sulfidation, and carbonatization.\nThree hydrothermal stages were identified, including pre-ore stage quartz (I), main-ore stage quartz-sulfides (\u2161), and post-ore stage quartz-carbonate (III). Quartz of stage I is characterized by pervasive silicas in altered rocks and is commonly crosscut by the later quartz veins\/veinlets (Fig. 3f). Stage II quartz occurs as smoky gray to milky white veins of several centimeters to several meters wide, locally with comb textures (Fig. 3a, e). Minor amounts of disseminated euhedral to anhedral sulfides (pyrite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite) can be observed in the stage II quartz vein and the altered rocks on both sides (Fig. 3a-d). The main-ore stage quartz-sulfides vein was usually cut by the milky white quartz veinlets of stage III (Fig. 3g). Calcite occurs as white veinlets filling the fractures of wall rocks (Fig. 3h) or coexists with stage III fine-grained quartz as veinlets to cut the quartz veins of earlier stages (Fig. 3i).\n\n\n3.2\nDazaohuo gold deposit\nThe deposit is located about 5\u00a0km to the south of the Central Kunlun fault and approximately 20\u00a0km northwest of the Heicigou gold deposit (Fig. 1c). The strata exposed in the district include the Proterozoic Wanbaogou Group, the Permian Ma\u2019erzheng Formation, and the Triassic Hongshuichuan Formation (Fig. 4\n). In the ore district, the fault structures are developed and can be divided into two groups: the NWW-trending faults (F1, F3, F4, F5 and F8) and the NW-trending faults (F2, F6 and F7). The NWW-trending faults are the main ore-hosting structures. The middle Silurian biotite monzogranite (432.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0Ma) exposed in the central and western areas of the ore district has no direct genetic relationship with the gold mineralization.\nThe deposit contains ten Au orebodies, among which No. M1 and M2 orebodies account for the most amounts of the proven ore reserves. These two orebodies are 80 to 478\u00a0m long and 0.95 to 14.30\u00a0m wide (Fig. 4b), with average Au grades varying from 1.51 to 6.27\u00a0g\/t. These orebodies are hosted by the carboniferous slates of the Permian Ma\u2019erzheng Formation and clastic rocks of the Triassic Hongshuichuan Formation. They strike roughly SEE, dip 44\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 to the north, and are layered and lenticular in shape (Fig. 4c).\nMineralization at Dazaohuo occurs predominantly as disseminated ores in the altered wall rocks (Fig. 5\na, b). Mineral assemblages are relatively simple. Sulfides account for about 5% of the ore and consist mainly of pyrite and arsenopyrite disseminated in altered wall rocks (Fig. 5c). Gangue minerals include quartz, calcite, sericite and chlorite (Fig. 5d\u2013i). Hydrothermal alterations in the deposit include silicification, sulfidation, carbonatization, sericitization and chloritization (Fig. 5e\u2013i). Silicification and sulfidation are closely related to gold mineralization.\nBased on the cross-cutting relationships, the hydrothermal mineral assemblage can be divided into three stages: (I) pre-ore stage milky white quartz; (II) main-ore stage quartz-sulfides; and (III) post-ore stage quartz-carbonate. Milky white quartz in the pre-ore stage occurs as veins that were commonly deformed or brecciated and cemented or cut by later quartz veins (Fig. 5e, f). The main-ore stage quartz-sulfides are typically composed of quartz, sericite and pyrite, with minor amounts of arsenopyrite and chlorite (Fig. 5a, b, e, h). Quartz is smoky-gray to gray-white and occurs as veins, stockworks, and pervasive silicas. Pyrite and arsenopyrite are euhedral to subhedral and disseminated in altered rocks. Quartz and calcite coexist in the post-ore stage and occur as veinlets and stockworks that usually cut the minerals of earlier stages (Fig. 5g, i).\n\n\n3.3\nHeihainan gold deposit\nThe Heihainan gold deposit is located to the north of the South Kunlun fault (Fig. 1c). The stratigraphy in the ore district consists of the Ordovician Naij Tal Group, the Permian Ma\u2019erzheng Formation, and the Triassic Changmahe Formation. Granites of the late Silurian and early Cretaceous are distributed in the eastern mining area. The late Triassic granodiorite apophyses locally intruded into the strata. The faults in the area strike mainly NW- to NWW-trending and controlled the occurrence of orebodies (Fig. 6\n).\nFive ore zones, occurring in the Changmahe Formation, have been delineated at Heihainan (M I\u2013M\u2164, Fig. 6a). The MII ore zone is the largest one, about 3.1\u00a0km long and 5\u223c20\u00a0m wide, with a strike of 115\u00b0\u2013120\u00b0 and a dip of 50\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 to the south (Fig. 6b, c). It consists of nine Au orebodies that are 80\u2013560\u00a0m long and 0.75\u20132.10\u00a0m wide, with average gold grades varying from 1.02 to 3.32\u00a0g\/t.\nHydrothermal alteration at Heihainan includes silicification, sericitization, sulfidation, and carbonatization. Silicification and sulfidation are closely related to gold mineralization. Mineralization occurs as auriferous quartz veins and disseminated ores in the altered rocks (Fig. 7\na, b). Ore minerals are mainly composed of pyrite and arsenopyrite, with minor amounts of chalcopyrite and native gold (Fig. 7c\u2013f). Gangue minerals include quartz, sericite, calcite with minor chlorite and epidote.\nFour hydrothermal stages were identified according to mineral assemblages and their crosscutting relationships, including early quartz stage (I), quartz-sulfides-sericite stage (\u2161), milky white quartz stage (III), and quartz-calcite stage (\u2163). The mineral assemblage of stage I is mainly composed of milky white quartz veins of a few wide that typically fill along regional schistosity, with strikes of 120\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 and dips of 40\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 to the south (Fig. 7f). In stage \u2161, the mineral assemblage includes quartz, pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and sericite. Quartz is grayish-white, with strikes of 140\u00b0\u223c160\u00b0 and nearly vertical dips (Fig. 7g). Pyrite and arsenopyrite can be observed on both walls of the quartz vein. Quartz veins of stage III mainly fill tension joints or conjugate shear joints, with a strike of 50\u00b0 to70\u00b0 and a dip of 50\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 to the northwest (Fig. 7h). They are mostly milky white with a width of several centimeters. The mineral assemblage of the last stage comprises calcite and quartz veins\/veinlets, commonly cutting earlier stage veins (Fig. 7i).\n\n\n3.4\nOther gold deposits\n\n3.4.1\nHeihaibei gold deposit\nThis deposit is located south of the Central Kunlun fault, about 30\u00a0km north of the Heihainan gold deposit (Fig. 1c). The exposed strata are composed of the Wanbaogou Group, Naij Tal Group, Hongshuichuan and Naocangjiangou Formations. The tectonic framework is characterized by a series of predominantly NWW- to NW-trending faults. Indosinian-Yanshanian monzogranite is locally exposed in the middle part of the district. Gold orebodies are hosted by the Naij Tal Group clastic rocks and monzogranite, approximately 70 to 80\u00a0m long and 1.9 to 3.6\u00a0m wide, with Au grades ranging from 1.32 to 5.62\u00a0g\/t. Ore minerals are less than 5% and consist mainly of pyrite and arsenopyrite. Gangue minerals are predominantly composed of quartz and calcite. Hydrothermal alteration is dominated by silicification, sulfidation, and carbonatization.\n\n\n3.4.2\nXiaohongshanbei gold deposit\nThe Xiaohongshanbei gold deposit is near the Kunlun River and sandwiched between the Central and South Kunlun faults, approximately 20\u00a0km southeast of the Heicigou deposit (Fig. 1c). The exposed strata are the Naij Tal and Wanbaogou Groups. A series of NW-trending faults developed in the district, with strikes of 100\u00b0\u2013130\u00b0 and dips of 30\u00b0\u201380\u00b0 to the northeast. Under the influence of Caledonian tectonic activities, the strata in the district are locally mylonitized. The orebodies are hosted by the Naij Tal Group and occur typically as quartz veins that strike 140\u00b0\u2013160\u00b0 and dip nearly vertical. Disseminated euhedral to subhedral pyrites are also observed on both sides of wall rocks. Hydrothermal alteration includes silicification, pyritization, sericitization and chloritization. Ore minerals are dominated by pyrite with a minor amount of chalcopyrite, while gangue minerals are quartz, sericite, and chlorite.\n\n\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical methods\nAll the studied samples of this paper were collected from outcrops, prospecting trenches, and drill cores of the typical gold deposits described above. Twenty-two quartz samples and three calcite samples were collected for fluid inclusion analysis. Eight stage II milky white quartz samples are from Heicigou. Quartz samples from Dazaohuo include seven stage II smoky-gray to gray-white quartz and two stage III calcite. Seven quartz samples, including two stage I samples, three stage II samples, and two stage III samples, and one stage \u2163 calcite sample are from Heihainan. Fourteen quartz samples were used for hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis. These samples were collected from quartz veins in the main-ore stage of the three gold deposits, of which the samples from Heicigou, Dazaohuo, and Heihainan are six, four, and four, respectively. Eight stage III calcite samples were used for carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (four from Heicigou and the other four from Dazaohuo). Due to the low content of sulfide in the ores of Heicigou, suitable samples could not be collected for sulfur and lead isotopic analysis. Sulfide samples used for sulfur and lead isotope analysis were selected from the ores and the altered wall rocks adjacent to orebodies, including seven pyrite samples from Dazaohuo and five pyrite and two arsenopyrite samples from Heihainan. In addition, a quartz sample (D2401-2Zr, Fig. 2b) was collected from Heicigou for zircon U-Pb dating.\nQuartz samples were analyzed by microthermometry in the fluid inclusion laboratory at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing (CUGB). The phase transitions of the fluid inclusions were observed at temperatures ranging from \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C to 600\u00a0\u00b0C using a Linkham THMSG-600 heating\/freezing stage. The phase transition point was observed at a heating rate of 0.1 to 1\u00a0\u00b0C\/s. Five types of temperature data were obtained in this study including the initial melting temperature of solid CO2 (T\nm-CO2), final melting temperatures of ice (T\nm-ice), final melting temperatures of CO2 clathrate (T\nm-cla), homogenization temperatures of CO2 (T\nh-CO2), and total homogenization temperatures (T\nh). The salinities and densities of H2O-NaCl inclusions were calculated based on T\nm-ice and T\nh (Hall et al., 1988; Bodnar, 1993). The salinity of the H2O-CO2-NaCl fluid system was calculated by using T\nm-cla (Bozzo et al., 1975). The phase density of CO2 was estimated according to the diagram of the relationship between the homogenization temperature of CO2-bearing inclusions and CO2 phase density (Shepherd et al., 1985). The computer software Flincor was used to calculate the bulk densities of H2O-CO2-NaCl fluid inclusions (Brown, 1989; Brown and Lamb, 1989).\nLaser Raman spectroscopic analyses of the fluid inclusions were carried out on the Renishaw inVia Raman microspectrometer in the fluid inclusion laboratory at CUGB. The spectral range varies from 100 to 4000\u00a0cm\u22121 for the analysis of CO2, N2, and CH4 in the vapor phase. The spectral resolution is less than 2\u00a0cm\u22121. The spatial resolution is 1\u00a0\u03bcm, and the spectral repeatability is\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0cm\u22121.\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes of fluid inclusions in quartz were analyzed in the Stable Isotope Laboratory of Mineral Resources Institute at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing. A Finnigan MAT253-type mass spectrometer was used following the methods of Clayton and Mayeda (1963). Oxygen gas was produced by reacting the samples with BrF5 in externally heated nickel reaction vessels. Hydrogen was determined by reacting the H2O with zinc at a temperature of 550\u00a0\u00b0C. The results adopted the Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) as the standard for reducing H and O, with a precision of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u2030 for \u03b4D and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030 for \u03b418O.\nCarbon and oxygen isotopic compositions for hydrothermal calcite were analyzed in the Stable Isotope Laboratory of Mineral Resources Institute at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing. The CO2 used in the C-O isotope analyses was obtained by quantitatively reacting carbonate samples with phosphoric acid at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Carbon isotope ratios are reported relative to Peedee Belemnite (PDB) standard and oxygen isotope ratios are reported relative to SMOW. The carbon and oxygen isotope measurements have a precision better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030.\nSulfur and lead isotopic compositions were determined at the Analytical Laboratory of Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology. Sulfide samples were converted into SO2 for S isotopic analyses via oxidation reaction with Cu2O. \u03b434S values were measured using a Finnigan MAT 251-type mass spectrometer according to the Canyon Diablo Troilite (CDT) standard. Data were produced with an accuracy better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030. Lead isotopes were measured by thermal ionization mass spectrometry using an ISOPROBE-T mass spectrometer. Accuracy was better than 0.05% for 208Pb\/206Pb.\nZircon U-Pb dating was conducted using a Thermo Fisher\u2019s X-Series II ICP-MS instrument connected to a Coherent GeoLasPro-193\u00a0nm laser at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, CUGB. Helium was used as the carrier gas and was mixed with argon prior to entering the ICP-MS torch. All data were acquired on zircon in single-spot ablation mode using a spot size of 32\u00a0\u03bcm with 6\u00a0Hz laser pulse repetition rate. Isotope measurements were using zircon 91,500 as the external standard for U-Th-Pb isotopic ratios (Wiedenbeck et al., 1995; Wiedenbeck et al., 2004), NIST610 as the external standard for determination of trace elements, and Plesovice as a monitoring standard for each analysis. Time-dependent drifts of U-Th-Pb isotopic ratios were corrected using linear interpolation overtime for every five analyses according to the variations of the 91,500 standard. For each analysis, 20\u00a0s of background were acquired followed by 50\u00a0s of signal. Quantification of trace-element concentrations and U-Pb zircon dates were carried out using the ICPMSDataCal program (Liu et al., 2008). The age calculations and plotting of Concordia diagrams were made by using Isoplot (Ludwig, 2004).\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nFluid inclusions\n\n5.1.1\nFluid inclusion petrography\nPetrography studies on fluid inclusions were conducted on the Heicigou, Dazaohuo and Heihainan gold deposits. Since fluid inclusions in the quartz and calcite of stages I and III from Heicigou and Dazaohuo are too tiny to observe, the fluid inclusions in the quartz of the main-ore stage (stage \u2161) are focused for these two deposits. According to the composition and phase characteristics of inclusions at room temperature, three types of fluid inclusions were distinguished in the main-ore stage quartz (Fig. 8\n), including two-phase aqueous inclusions (type 1), CO2-bearing three-phase inclusions (type 2), and pure CO2 inclusions (type 3). Most of them are the first two types, and type 3 inclusions can be observed occasionally. Fluid inclusions in the post-stage quartz and calcite are dominated by type 1 inclusions, and the other two types of inclusions are not observed.\nThe type 1 inclusions are the primary inclusion type in quartz from the main-ore stage, with a proportion of >85%. They consist of a liquid phase (LH2O) and a vapor bubble (VH2O) with V\/(V\u00a0+\u00a0L) ratios varying from 5% to 25%, most commonly from 10% to 20% (Fig. 8a\u2013c). A few inclusions lack the vapor phase and occur as a single liquid phase at room temperature (Fig. 8a, d). Type 2 inclusions are composed of vapor CO2 (VCO2), liquid CO2 (LCO2), and liquid H2O (LH2O) with a proportion of about 10% (Fig. 8e\u2013g). Type 3 inclusions generally appear as one (LCO2) or two phases (LCO2\u00a0+\u00a0VCO2) at room temperature (Fig. 8h, i). The proportion of pure CO2 inclusions is less than 5%.\n\n\n5.1.2\nMicrothermometry\nMicrothermometric data obtained from fluid inclusions of three gold deposits are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 9\n.\nThe inclusions in the stage II quartz of Heicigou are dominated by type 1 and 2 inclusions. Type 1 inclusions homogenized to the liquid phase at temperatures between 186 and 360 \u2103 (average 227 \u2103). The T\nm-ice varies from \u22126.8 to \u22122.1 \u2103 and the corresponding calculated salinities are 3.6\u201310.2% NaCleq (average 7.0% NaCleq). Densities of the bulk inclusions range from 0.81 to 0.94\u00a0g\/cm3. The T\nm-CO2 of type 2 inclusions vary from \u221259.0 to \u221257.0 \u2103, slightly lower than the triple point temperature of pure CO2 (\u221256.6 \u2103), indicating the gas phase is mainly composed of CO2. The T\nm-cla varies from 4.9 to 8.6 \u2103 and the corresponding calculated salinities vary from 2.8 to 9.1% NaCleq, with an average of 4.9% NaCleq. The T\nh-CO2 is between 12.4 and 30.0 \u2103 and the estimated densities of the CO2 phase range from 0.68 to 0.98\u00a0g\/cm3. Densities of the bulk inclusions range from 0.81 to 1.04\u00a0g\/cm3. Most of the type 2 inclusions homogenized to liquid in the range of 220 to 332 \u2103, with an average of 265 \u2103. The total homogenization temperatures of five pure CO2 inclusions (type 3) are 21.0\u201325.9 \u2103.\nIn the stage II quartz from the Dazaohuo gold deposit, the type 1 inclusions homogenized to liquid at temperatures ranging from 185 to 338 \u2103, mostly in the range of 200\u2013220 \u2103 with an average of 222 \u2103. The T\nm-ice varies from \u22126.5 to \u22122.6 \u2103, corresponding to salinities of 4.3\u20139.9% NaCleq (average 6.9% NaCleq). Densities of the bulk inclusions range from 0.79 to 0.94\u00a0g\/cm3. The T\nm-CO2 of the type 2 inclusions is also slightly below the triple-phase point of CO2, which ranges from \u221259.2 to \u221258.1 \u2103. The T\nm-cla varies from 5.7 to 8.8 \u2103, corresponding to salinities of 2.4\u20138.0% NaCleq. The T\nh-CO2 is between 18.1 \u2103 and 29.2 \u2103. The densities of the CO2 phase and the bulk inclusions range from 0.62 to 0.79\u00a0g\/cm3 and from 0.89 to 1.00\u00a0g\/cm3, respectively. These inclusions homogenized to liquid at temperatures of 215 to 334 \u2103. The T\nm-CO2 of the type 3 inclusions ranges from \u221257.1 to \u221256.9 \u2103 and the homogenization of CO2 to liquid phase occurred between 3.5 and 23.3 \u2103. In the calcite of stage III, only four homogenization temperatures of type 1 inclusion were obtained, varying from 164 to 182 \u2103.\nIn the stage I quartz of Heihainan, the dominant type 1 inclusions homogenized to the liquid phase at temperatures between 188 and 273 \u2103. The T\nm-ice varies from \u22124.6 to \u22122.6 \u2103 and the corresponding calculated salinities are 4.3\u20137.3% NaCleq. In the stage II quartz, the T\nh of type 1 inclusions is between 183 and 272 \u2103. The T\nm-ice ranges from \u22126.4 to \u22123.3 \u2103, corresponding to salinities of 5.7\u20139.7% NaCleq. Densities of the bulk inclusions vary from 0.83 to 0.96\u00a0g\/cm3. The T\nh of type 2 inclusions is between 238 and 295 \u2103. The T\nm-CO2 varies from \u221258.0 to \u221256.8 \u2103. The T\nm-cla ranges from 7.0 to 9.1 \u2103, corresponding to salinities of 1.8\u2013\u00a05.8% NaCleq. The T\nh-CO2 varies within the range of 24.7 to 29.2 \u2103. The densities of the CO2 phase and bulk inclusions range from 0.62 to 0.71\u00a0g\/cm3 and from 0.90 to 0.95\u00a0g\/cm3, respectively. The pure CO2 inclusions homogenized to liquid at 25.1 \u2103 to 29.2 \u2103. The T\nh of the type 1 inclusions from stage III quartz and stage \u2163 calcite are 160\u2013224 \u2103 and 161\u2013195 \u2103, respectively. The T\nm-ice varies from \u22125.0 to \u22122.9 \u2103, and from \u22124.4 to \u22122.1 \u2103, corresponding to salinities ranging from 4.8 to 7.9% NaCleq, and from 3.5 to 7.0% NaCleq, respectively.\n\n\n5.1.3\nLaser Raman spectroscopy\nLaser Raman spectrums of two-phase aqueous inclusions show wide peaks at 3310\u20133610\u00a0cm\u22121 (Fig. 10\na, c, e), indicating that the main component of this type of inclusions is H2O. Spectrums of CO2-bearing three-phase inclusions show strong peaks at 1280\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1386\u00a0cm\u22121, suggesting that CO2 is contained in their compositions. In addition, there are obvious broad peaks at 3310\u20133610\u00a0cm\u22121, indicating the presence of H2O (Fig. 10b, d, f). No other gases such as CH4 and N2 were detected in these inclusions, which is consistent with the microthermometric data that the melting temperatures of solid CO2 (\u221259.2 to \u221256.8 \u2103) are near the triple point temperature of pure CO2 (\u221256.6 \u2103).\n\n\n\n5.2\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopes\nThe hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data for fluid inclusions in stage II quartz from the gold deposits in the Kunlun River area are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The \u03b418OH2O values for fluids were calculated based on the fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures and fractionation equation between quartz and water (Clayton et al., 1972).\nIn the Heicigou deposit, the values of \u03b4D and \u03b418OH2O vary from \u221297.0\u2030 to \u221251.0\u2030 and from 0.5\u2030 to 6.0\u2030, respectively. In the Dazaohuo deposit, the \u03b4D values are between \u221269.1\u2030 and \u221262.4\u2030, and the \u03b418OH2O values range from 5.7\u2030 to 7.0\u2030. At Heihainan, the \u03b4D and \u03b418OH2O values vary from \u221284.7\u2030 to \u221265.0\u2030 and from 3.9\u2030 to 6.5\u2030, respectively.\n\n\n5.3\nCarbon and oxygen isotopes\nCarbon and oxygen isotope data for hydrothermal calcite of the Heicigou and Dazaohuo gold deposits are presented in Supplementary Table S3. The \u03b413CCO2 and \u03b418OH2O values of fluids were calculated based on the mean value of the fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of calcite and fractionation equations from Ohmoto and Rye (1979) and O'Neil et al. (1969). In the Heicigou deposit, the \u03b413CPDB and \u03b418OSMOW values of calcite vary from 3.5\u2030 to 5.5\u2030 and from 8.8\u2030 to 20.5\u2030, respectively. The calculated \u03b413CCO2 and \u03b418OH2O values range from 4.1\u2030 to 6.1\u2030 and from 0.8\u2030 to 12.5\u2030, respectively. In the Dazaohuo deposit, the \u03b413CPDB values vary from \u22123.8\u2030 to \u22120.1\u2030, and the \u03b418OSMOW values range from 13.4\u2030 to 14.2\u2030. The calculated \u03b413CCO2 and \u03b418OH2O values vary from \u22123.0\u2030 to 0.7\u2030 and from 5.6\u2030 to 6.4\u2030, respectively.\n\n\n5.4\nSulfur and lead isotopes\nThe results are listed in Supplementary Table S4. The \u03b434S values of seven pyrite samples from the Dazaohuo deposit vary from 4.4\u2030 to 8.1\u2030 with an average of 6.7\u2030. Five pyrite and two arsenopyrite samples of the Heihainan deposit has significantly lighter \u03b434S values, which range from \u221217.3\u2030 to \u221211.2\u2030 with an average of \u221215.7\u2030.\nSeven pyrite samples from the Dazaohuo deposit have 206Pb\/204Pb ratios ranging from 18.410 to 18.652, 207Pb\/204Pb ratios ranging from 15.631 to 15.683, and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios ranging from 38.419 to 38.739. The ratios of 206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb, and 208Pb\/204Pb of two pyrite samples and one arsenopyrite sample from the Heihainan deposit vary from 18.063 to 18.603, from 15.619 to 15.637, and from 38.231 to 38.502, respectively. The \u03bc values of the two deposits range from 9.51 to 9.60 and from 9.52 to 9.54, respectively.\n\n\n5.5\nZircon U-Pb dating\nThe U-Pb analytical results and rare earth element (REE) contents of zircons from the auriferous quartz vein at Heicigou are summarized in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, respectively. Zircon cathodoluminescence (CL) images are shown in Fig. 11\n. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns and the age data are plotted in Fig. 12\n.\nZircons from the auriferous quartz vein are colorless or light-brown, transparent to translucent, and euhedral to subhedral. They typically have a prismatic morphology, with a length varying from 50 to 100\u00a0\u03bcm and length to width ratios ranging between 1:1 and 2:1, and show clear oscillatory zoning in CL images (Fig. 11). The Th and U concentrations of 19 zircon grains range from 89 to 1083\u00a0ppm and from 191 to 1118\u00a0ppm, respectively, with Th\/U ratios of 0.32 to 0.97. The contents of REE vary from 233 to 1771\u00a0ppm, and the ratios of LREE\/HREE range from 0.01 to 0.17, indicating an enrichment of HREE relative to LREE. The values of \u03b4Eu and \u03b4Ce vary from 0.04 to 0.54 and from 1.43 to 161.99, respectively, showing obvious negative Eu anomalies and strong positive Ce anomalies (Fig. 12a). According to the U-Pb isotopic ages and REE geochemistry, these zircons can be divided into two groups (Fig. 12b). Eight zircon grains of group I yielded 206Pb\/238U ages varying from 427 to 439\u00a0Ma, with a concordant age of 434.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a02.5) and a weighted average age of 433.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0Ma (Fig. 12c). They are generally characterized by low \u03a3REE contents (233\u20131771\u00a0ppm), \u03b4Eu values (0.04\u20130.54) and high \u03b4Ce values (45.13\u2013161.99). Group II contains eleven zircon grains, ranging in 206Pb\/238U age from 239 to 246\u00a0Ma, with a concordant age of 243.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.34) and a weighted average age of 243.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0Ma (Fig. 12d). Compared with group I zircons, they have higher \u03a3REE contents (626\u20131567\u00a0ppm) and \u03b4Eu values (0.12\u20130.39) but lower \u03b4Ce values (1.43\u201348.05).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nNature and source of the ore-forming fluids\nThe gold deposits in the Kunlun River area have similar fluid characteristics in temperature, salinity and composition. Three major types of fluid inclusions are developed in these gold deposits, including two-phase aqueous inclusions, CO2-bearing three-phase inclusions and pure CO2 inclusions. The homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions at the main-ore stage vary from 183 to 360 \u2103, mostly between 200 and 250 \u2103, showing a dominantly moderate temperature for the ore-forming fluid. The salinities range from 1.8 to 10.2% NaCleq, indicating a relatively low saline fluid. Based on the results of fluid inclusion petrography, microthermometry and laser Raman analyses, it is considered that the ore-forming fluids of the studied gold deposits in the Kunlun River area belong to a H2O-CO2-NaCl system with a moderate temperature and a low salinity, which is consistent with the fluid characteristics of orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998, 2020; Kolb et al., 2000; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Fusswinkel et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2018).\nFluid immiscibility likely took place at these gold deposits. Evidence of fluid immiscibility includes: (1) the type 1 and 2 inclusions coexist in the same growth zones of the quartz (Fig. 8e, f), indicating that they formed contemporaneously; (2) compared with the two-phase aqueous inclusions, the CO2-bearing three-phase inclusions have higher total homogenization, which is consistent with fluid immiscibility (Roedder, 1984); (3) the pure CO2 inclusions have a similar range of CO2 homogenization temperatures as the CO2-bearing three-phase inclusions, suggesting that they probably represent an unmixed CO2-rich end-member (Neng et al., 1999).\nIn the \u03b4D vs. \u03b418O diagram (Fig. 13\n), most data plot in the overlapping fields of magmatic and metamorphic waters, suggesting that the ore-forming fluids of the three gold deposits were associated with a metamorphic and\/or magmatic source. The \u03b418OH2O and \u03b4D values of the ore-forming fluids (mostly, \u03b418OH2O\u00a0=\u00a04\u2030 to 7\u2030 and \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221285\u2030 to \u221250\u2030) are similar to those of typical orogenic gold deposits (\u03b418OH2O\u00a0=\u00a05\u2030 to 10\u2030, \u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u221280\u2030 to \u221220\u2030; Groves et al. 1998; Goldfarb et al. 2004; Kerrich et al., 2000). Although the contribution of magmatic hydrothermal fluids cannot be excluded from orogenic gold deposits in metamorphosed terranes with felsic magmatic intrusions contemporaneous with the gold mineralization (e.g., Gara gold deposit in the Loulo mining district, Mali; Lawrence et al., 2013), in the Kunlun River area, except for the late Triassic granodiorite apophyses exposed locally in the Heihainan gold deposit, the emplacement ages of granites exposed in the other two gold deposits are earlier than the timing of gold mineralization. Fluid inclusion studies suggest that the ore-forming fluids are of moderate temperature and low salinity, different from typical high-temperature and high-salinity magmatic fluids (Chen et al., 2007; Rusk et al., 2008). In addition, alterations related to magmatic-hydrothermal systems, such as potassic alteration (Sillitoe, 2010; \u00c9ric et al., 2015), are absent in the gold deposits of the Kunlun River area. Therefore, the ore-forming fluids of the three gold deposits may be mainly derived from metamorphic water rather than magmatic water. It is also noted that two data points of Heicigou have lower values of \u03b4D and \u03b418OH2O, probably reflecting a minor contribution of meteoric water.\nIt is worth noting that there are relatively apparent differences in H-O isotopes among the three gold deposits. The study of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes shows that the ore-forming fluids are derived from metamorphic water. Because the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of metamorphic water may be highly variable under the influence of the respective rock types and their history of fluid-rock interaction (Hoefs, 2009), it is thus concluded that the difference of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions among these three gold deposits in the Kunlun River area may be attributed to the different host rocks and\/or the fluid-rock interaction during ore-forming fluids migration. Compared with the three gold deposits in the Kunlun River area, most samples from other gold deposits in the EKOB are proximity to the magmatic water field and tend to drift to the meteoric water line, indicating that magmatic water and meteoric water may also be involved in the formation of these gold deposits in the EKOB. In addition, experimental and simulation studies show that when the temperature is >250 \u2103, fluid boiling will lead to the D preferentially fractionate into the vapor phase, which will reduce the \u03b4D value of the residual fluid (Berndt et al., 1996, Driesner and Seward, 2000). If fluid boiling had occurred during the formation of these gold deposits, it would also cause differences in hydrogen isotopic compositions. Therefore, the different ore-forming fluid sources, mixing with other fluids and\/or potential fluid boiling are responsible for the broader range of \u03b4D and \u03b418OH2O values (\u03b4D\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212107\u2030 to \u221259.6\u2030, \u03b418OH2O\u00a0=\u00a01.4\u2030 to 9.2\u2030) of other gold deposits in the EKOB.\nIn terms of oxygen isotopes of hydrothermal calcites, the calculated \u03b418OH2O values for Heicigou and Dazaohuo vary from 0.8\u2030 to 12.5\u2030 and from 5.6\u2030 to 6.4\u2030, respectively. Three calcite samples from Heicigou have relatively lower \u03b418OH2O values (0.8\u2030\u20130.9\u2030, Supplementary Table S3) that are close to those of two quartz samples (0.5\u2030 and 1.3\u2030, Supplementary Table S2) affected by meteoric water, reflecting a mixture of meteoric water in the latest stage of mineralization. The \u03b418OH2O values of calcite at Dazaohuo (5.6\u2030\u20136.4\u2030) are consistent with those of the quartz (5.7\u2030\u20137.0\u2030) and similar to metamorphic water (5\u2030\u201325\u2030, Zheng and Chen, 2000), further suggesting that the ore-forming fluids were predominantly derived from metamorphic water.\n\n\n6.2\nSource of the ore-forming materials\nThere are three critical possible reservoirs of carbon in ore-forming fluids, i.e., mantle and magma carbon (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125\u2030 to \u22122\u2030 and \u22129\u2030 to \u22123\u2030, respectively; Taylor, 1986), marine carbonates (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122\u2030 to 3\u2030, with a mean value of approximately 0\u2030; Veizer et al., 1980), and biogenetic organic matter (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u221230\u2030 to \u221215\u2030, with an average of \u201322\u2030; Ohmoto, 1972; Hoefs, 2009).\nThe carbon isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal calcite at Heicigou are characterized by an enrichment in heavy carbon isotopes (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a03.5\u2030\u20135.5\u2030) and the calculated \u03b413CCO2 values are between 4.1\u2030 and 6.1\u2030, which are significantly different from the mantle and magma carbon or biogenetic organic matter. Thus, marine carbonates might be the source of carbon in the fluids. Although the calculated \u03b413CCO2 values are greater than marine carbonates, strong carbon isotope fractionations would occur between source carbonates and released gaseous CO2 during metamorphic decarburization reactions at temperatures higher than 300 \u2103 (Bottinga, 1969). This process may result in the enrichment of 13C in released gaseous CO2, and the \u03b413CCO2 value may increase by about 2.5\u2030\u20133\u2030 compared to the parental carbonate source (L\u00fcders et al., 2015). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the carbon in the ore-forming fluids was sourced from the carbonate strata (the Wanbaogou Group and\/or the Naij Tal Group) in the region. Compared with the Heicigou deposit, the values of \u03b413C values of four calcite samples (\u22123.8\u2030 to \u22120.1\u2030) from Dazaohuo and the calculated \u03b413CCO2 values of the ore-forming fluid (\u22123.0\u2030 to 0.7\u2030) are closer to the \u03b413C values of marine carbonates, also indicating a marine carbonate source for the carbon in ore-forming fluids.\nSulfides (mainly pyrite and arsenopyrite) are the only sulfur-bearing minerals in the Dazaohuo and Heihainan gold deposits, indicating that the sulfur in ore-forming fluids was in the reduced form of HS- and\/or S2-, and the sulfides precipitated under a low f\nO2 condition. Thus, the \u03b434S values of sulfides in the deposits could represent the total sulfur isotopic compositions of their ore-forming fluids (Ohmoto, 1972; Ohmoto and Rye, 1979). However, the sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfides in Dazaohuo are significantly different from those in Heihainan (Fig. 14\na). The sulfides from Dazaohuo are characterized by an enrichment in 34S (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a04.4\u2030\u20138.1\u2030), while the sulfides at Heihainan have significantly negative \u03b434S values (\u221217.3\u2030 to \u221211.2\u2030), suggesting that the sulfur source of these two deposits may be quite different.\nAs showing in Fig. 14a, the sulfur isotopic compositions of the Dazaohuo deposit are similar to those of gold deposits hosted in the Proterozoic, Ordovician and Triassic strata in the CKL and SKL (e.g., Wulonggou, Asiha, Guoluolongwa and Kaihuangbei gold deposits), which are characterized by enrichment in 34S, whereas sulfides from Heihainan and other gold deposits hosted in the Triassic Bayan Har Group in the BH (e.g., Dachang and Dongdatan gold deposits) are characterized by negative \u03b434S values. In previous studies, some researchers argued that the sulfur source of the gold deposits in the EKOB was associated with magma (e.g., Hu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2017). However, the sulfur isotopic compositions of the Heihainan gold deposit and other gold deposits in the BH (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a00\u2030 to \u221217\u2030) are significantly different from magmatic sulfur (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u2030; Ohmoto and Rye, 1979). For these gold deposits with anomalous negative \u03b434S values, the sulfur is supposed to be sourced from synsedimentary sulfides generated by reducing seawater sulfate (e.g., the Donlin Creek gold deposit; Goldfarb et al., 2004). The sulfide \u03b434S values of Dazaohuo and the gold deposits in the CKL and SKL (0\u2030\u20137.5\u2030) are more consistent with most of the orogenic gold deposits (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a00\u2030\u201310\u2030; Kerrich, 1987; Kerrich, 1989; Nesbitt, 1991; Partington and Williams, 2000), though they could be interpreted as derived from magma (e.g., McCuaig and Kerrich, 1998) when a magma contains a significant crustal melt component (Goldfarb et al., 2004). Although the mid-west of the Dazaohuo ore district is covered by monzogranite, as mentioned above, the emplacement of the monzogranite is ca. 432.5\u00a0Ma which is earlier than the gold mineralization, and there is no magmatic activity contemporaneous with gold mineralization near the ore district. Therefore, the sulfur in these deposits might not be sourced from magma.\nSedimentary rocks could be an ideal reservoir of sulfur for the orogenic gold deposits (Pitcairn et al., 2006, 2015; Tomkins, 2010, 2013a; Large et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2011). By reduction of seawater sulfates, the sulfur was initially trapped in synsedimentary pyrite (Goldfrab et al., 1997), which should have \u03b434S values 20\u2030\u201325\u2030 lighter than the coeval marine sulfates (Goldfarb et al., 2004). In the subsequent metamorphism, the breakdown of pyrite to pyrrhotite was accompanied by the generation of H2S (Tomkins, 2010; Thomas et al., 2011; Finch and Tomkins, 2017), which would essentially have the same sulfur isotopic composition as the original pyrite (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Goldfarb et al., 2004). Ultimately, the sulfur isotope compositions of many sediment-hosted deposits vary in a parallel fashion to the seawater sulfate curve (Fig. 14b; Chang et al., 2008). Therefore, syngenetic pyrite in sedimentary rocks might play a pivotal role in providing sulfur to form gold deposits. The gold deposits in the EKOB generally show the trend of sulfur isotopes of the sediment-hosted orogenic gold deposits, which seems to imply the relationship between reduced sulfur in these deposits and seawater sulfates, although the \u03b434S values of the Dazaohuo and Kaihuangbei deposits deviate from the curves (Fig. 14b).\n\nZhai et al. (2021) reported the in situ sulfur isotope of pre-ore pyrites in the host rocks (the Changmahe Formation) of the Dachang gold deposit. The results show that the isotopic composition of pre-ore pyrites can be divided into positive and negative end members. Pre-ore pyrites with positive-end (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a07.0\u2030 to 38.3\u2030) were considered to be generated at and below the sulfate-methane transition zone as a result of the anaerobic oxidation of methane. In contrast, negative-end pre-ore pyrites (\u03b434S\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128.5\u2030 to \u22124.3\u2030) formed above the sulfate-methane transition zone by bacterial reduction of sulfate in the seawater. The \u03b434S values of ore pyrites from Dachang vary from \u22129.4\u2030 to 1.0\u2030, indicating the sulfur in the ore-forming fluid was derived from the host wall rocks and ultimately from the Triassic seawater (Zhai et al., 2021). Sulfides from ores of the Heihainan gold deposit hosted in the Triassic Changmahe Formation are also characterized by significant negative \u03b434S values, indicating that the sulfur in the ore-forming fluid, like the Dachang gold deposit, was sourced from pyrite formed by bacterial reduction of sulfate in the Triassic strata. Because \u03b434S values of sulfides remain basically unchanged in metamorphism (Oliver et al., 1992), the lower \u03b434S values of Heihainan compared to Dachang may reflect that more intense fractionation may have occurred in the reduction process of seawater sulfate.\nFor the Dazaohuo gold deposit, sulfides have heavier sulfur isotopic compositions, although it also occurs in the Triassic strata. In comparison, the \u03b434S values of the Dazaohuo gold deposit are closer to those of the sulfides in the Ordovician strata (Fig. 14b), which are widely exposed in the Kunlun River area. During the Ordovician, the \u03b434S values of the seawater sulfate range from 24.1\u2030 to 25.4\u2030 (Strauss, 2004). Assuming that the fractionation between sulfate and sulfide (\u039434Ssulfate-sulfide) is 20\u2030\u201325\u2030 by seawater sulfate reduction, it could be inferred that the \u03b434S values of the gold deposits in the Ordovician strata are about \u22120.9\u2030 to 5.4\u2030, which are roughly similar to the \u03b434S values of the sulfides from Dazaohuo. Therefore, the Ordovician Naij Tal Group may be a potential source of sulfur in the ore-forming fluids. In summary, the sedimentary rocks near the ore district may have made a significant contribution towards providing sulfur in the gold mineralization.\nLead isotopes are an effective tool to trace metal sources in mineral deposits (Macfarlane et al., 1990; Chiaradia et al., 2004). The lead isotopic compositions of sulfides from the gold deposits in the Kunlun River area are relatively uniform, indicating that the ore lead is predominantly normal lead or mixed with only a small amount of radioactive lead. On the 207Pb\/204Pb versus 206Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb versus 206Pb\/204Pb diagrams (Fig. 15\n), the Pb isotopic data mainly plot in the area around or between the orogenic belt and the upper crustal lead evolution lines. The variation of the characteristic value of lead isotope (\u03bc) can also indicate the source of lead. Lead with high \u03bc values (>9.58) or radiogenic lead on the right side of the zero isochron is generally considered to be from the upper crust where U and Th are relatively enriched (Zartman and Doe, 1981), while low \u03bc values (<9.58) indicate that the lead should be mainly sourced from the lower crust or upper mantle (Doe and Stacey, 1974; Stacey and Kramers, 1975). In the Dazaohuo gold deposit, the \u03bc values of four pyrite samples are higher than or equal to 9.58, while the \u03bc values of the remaining three samples in Dazaohuo, as well as three samples in Heihainan, are all less than 9.58, indicating that the ore lead was derived from a mixed source of the upper and lower crusts. Considering that the Kunlun River area belongs to the East Kunlun orogenic belt, materials from different sources, such as the mantle and the upper and lower crusts, could be mixed well, resulting in the \u03bc values having the characteristics of different sources. The host rocks of the Dazhaohuo and Heihainan gold deposits are the clastic rocks of the Triassic Hongshuichuan and Changmahe Formations, respectively. Sediments of the Hongshuichuan Formation were predominately derived from the northern island-arcs, the Proterozoic metamorphic basement, and the A\u2019nyemaqen ophiolite complex (Yan et al., 2008; Li et al., 2015a), while the Changmahe Formation is a flysch sequence formed in the background of island arc or active continental margin (Tong et al., 2014). Such tectonic settings could provide a favorable background for the mixture of different provenances. In summary, the ore lead of the gold deposits in the Kunlun River area was mainly sourced from the upper crust of the orogenic belt, most probably from the ore hosting strata in the area.\n\n\n6.3\nTiming of Au mineralization\nThe zircons in the auriferous quartz vein of the Heicigou gold deposit show magmatic oscillatory zoning in CL images. They have high Th\/U ratios and low LREE\/HREE ratios and show obvious negative Eu anomalies and strong positive Ce anomalies. These characteristics are significantly different from hydrothermal and metamorphic zircons (Hoskin and Schaltegger, 2003; Hoskin, 2005; Schaltegger, 2007; Toscano et al., 2014; Rubatto, 2017; Yakymchuk et al., 2018), indicating a magmatic origin. Therefore, the two groups of zircons with different ages in the auriferous quartz vein are all captured zircons, which cannot represent the mineralization age. The 206Pb\/238U ages of the group I zircons range from 439 to 427\u00a0Ma, which are consistent with the emplacement time of the early-middle Silurian granites in the EKOB and Kunlun River area, representing magmatic activities during the late stage of oceanic crust subduction and the initiation collision of the Proto-Tethyan (Li et al., 2014b; Li et al., 2015c; Zhang et al., 2014). The U-Pb ages of the group II zircons (239\u2013246\u00a0Ma) are similar to the crystallization ages of the early-middle Triassic granites, lavas, and basic-ultrabasic rocks distributed in the EKOB, generated during the subduction of the Paleo-Tethyan (Ding et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015d, 2018a; Xia et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2017). Although these ages cannot represent the timing of gold mineralization, they do provide the lower limit of the mineralization age to be ca. 239\u00a0Ma.\nGenerally, orogenic gold deposits are typically formed in various geological settings, including fore-arc or back-arc location of active continental margins, with crustal depths from 2 to 15\u00a0km (Groves et al., 1998; Tomkins, 2013b; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Groves et al., 2020). They may form during various tectonic processes related to different orogenic stages from subduction to post-collision (Groves et al., 1998, 2003; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015), though orogenic gold deposits formed in the post-collision extension setting are not common. Thus, the crystallization ages of adakitic magmatic rocks, A-type granites and mafic migmatites, exposed in the EKOB and associated with post-collisional extension and related orogenic collapse, are conducive to limit the upper limit of the gold mineralization age in the area. Regionally, the adakitic and mafic magmatic activities are between 230 and 213\u00a0Ma, and the crystallization age of A-type granites ranges from 230 to 200\u00a0Ma (Ding et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018a; Chen et al., 2019b; Qu et al., 2019). Therefore, the upper limit of the gold mineralization age of Heicigou should be ca. 200\u00a0Ma. Combined with the ages of zircons captured in the auriferous quartz vein, the mineralization age of the Heicigou gold deposit is confined between 239 and 200\u00a0Ma in the middle to late Triassic.\nPrevious 40Ar\/39Ar isotopic dating has shown that some gold deposits in the EKOB formed in the middle to late Triassic. In the Dachang and Wulonggou gold deposits, sericite from gold ores yielded 40Ar\/39Ar isochron ages of 220.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma and 238.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0Ma, respectively (Zhang et al., 2005). In the Naomuhun gold deposit, hydrothermal sericite outlined 40Ar\/39Ar isochron ages of 228.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma (Li et al., 2017). In the Shuizhadonggou-Huanglonggou gold deposit, two types of hydrothermal sericite from a gold mineralized syenogranite sample yielded two 40Ar\/39Ar ages of 237.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0Ma and 230.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0Ma, representing the timing of hydrothermal alteration and gold mineralization, respectively (Zhang et al., 2017). In addition, Rb-Sr isochron dating of fluid inclusions in quartz from the Yanjingou gold deposit gave a mineralization age of about 237\u00a0Ma (Chen et al., 2019a). The geochronological data are consistent with the mineralization age of the Heicigou gold deposit, suggesting that the metallogenic process was closely related to the orogeny of the EKOB in the early Mesozoic.\n\n\n6.4\nOre genesis and regional tectonic evolution\nGold deposits in the Kunlun River area have geological and geochemical features similar to orogenic gold deposits (Groves, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). The gold deposits are situated between two NW- to NWW-trending regional fault zones (the Central and South Kunlun faults), but the secondary faults control the gold mineralization. Orebodies are hosted in low-grade metamorphic greenschist facies clastic rocks. Mineralization occurs as steep dipping auriferous quartz veins and disseminated ores in the adjacent altered rocks. The wall rock alteration is mainly silicification, pyritization, and carbonatization. The primary metal minerals in the ore are typically less than 5% and consist mainly of pyrite and arsenopyrite, with a minor amount of native gold and chalcopyrite. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the gold mineralization was associated with a H2O-CO2-NaCl system of moderate temperature and low salinity. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicate that the ore-forming fluids were derived from metamorphic water, while C, S and Pb isotopes suggest that carbon, sulfur and lead were sourced from sedimentary rocks.\nPhase separation is considered to be one of the main mechanisms of metal precipitation for orogenic gold deposits (e.g., Klein et al., 2008, 2015; Lawrence et al., 2013; Goldfarb and Groves, 2015; Lambert-Smith et al., 2016; Grandjean da Costa et al., 2019). In the gold deposits in the Kunlun River area, phase separation caused by fluid immiscibility is evidenced by fluid inclusion petrography. Generally, in the reducing fluid with medium to high temperature (200\u2013350 \u2103), near-neutral and low salinity, gold migrates mainly as complexes of Au(HS)2\n- and Au(HS)0 (Seward, 1973; Shenberger and Barnes, 1989; Mikucki, 1998; Stef\u00e1nsson and Seward, 2004; Pokrovski et al., 2009; Williams-Jones et al., 2009). In such a system, fluid immiscibility is a very effective mechanism for extracting sulfur from the fluid, because reduced sulfur, especially H2S, is preferentially partitioned into the gas phase (Giggenbach, 1980; Craw, 1992). As a result, fluid immiscibility that occurred in closed or limited open systems could cause a decrease in gold solubility up to 3\u20134 orders of magnitude (Craw, 1992). Therefore, fluid immiscibility may have played a prominent part in gold precipitation in the Kunlun River area.\nFluid-rock interaction is another important mechanism for gold precipitation (Ridley et al., 1996; Mikucki, 1998; Evans et al., 2006; Hodkiewicz et al., 2009; Williams-Jones et al., 2009). Due to gold migrates as a bisulfide complex in orogenic systems, when this complex reacts with Fe-bearing rocks, it will result in the gold deposited from the solution during the formation of Fe sulfide minerals (Neall and Phillips, 1987; Bohlke, 1989). Thus, changes in bisulfide activity during fluid-rock interaction can cause decreases in gold solubility by orders of magnitude (Neall and Phillips, 1987; Mikucki, 1998; Taylor et al., 2021), and iron-rich host rocks are considered to be important depositional sites for orogenic gold deposits (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Bohlke, 1989). The clastic rocks of the Naij Tal Group, Hongshuichuan and Ma\u2019erzheng Formations and Bayan Har Group (Changmahe Formation), the host rocks of the three gold deposits in the Kunlun River area, have TFe2O3 contents of 4.62\u20135.27%, 3.00\u20134.73%, 1.18\u20136.02%, and 3.01\u201310.19% (Hu et al., 2013; Tong et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017), respectively, which is conducive to fluid-rock interaction. Pyrite is usually observed in the altered wall rocks on both sides of the auriferous quartz veins and silicified ores in the gold deposits at the Kunlun River area, indicating that fluid-rock interaction had taken place. Moreover, mass-balance calculations indicate that compared with the fresh wall rocks without alteration, the contents of CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, and SiO2 in the altered rocks increase significantly, while the Na2O content decease obviously (unpublished data). This result implies that the material exchange between ore-forming fluids and wall rocks.\nThe formation of orogenic gold deposits in the EKOB is closely related to regional tectonic evolution. The EKOB was involved in the evolution of the Proto-Tethyan Ocean and the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean in the early Paleozoic and the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic, respectively (Yang et al., 1996, 2009; Bian et al., 2004; Mo et al., 2007; Pan et al., 1996, 2012; Li et al., 2018a, 2018b). At the late Neoproterozoic (800\u2013550\u00a0Ma), with the breakup of Rodinia, the Proto-Tethyan Ocean opened (Dalziel, 1997; Lu et al., 2008; Bogdanova et al., 2009; Zhao and Xiao, 2018; Jian et al., 2020). The ophiolites with ages of 537\u2013481\u00a0Ma distributed in the CKL (e.g., Qingshuiquan, Changshishan, Tatuo, Qushi\u2019ang, and Kekesha; Yang et al., 1996, Feng et al., 2010; Wei, 2015; Qi et al., 2016a) represent the Proto-Tethyan oceanic crust. The subduction-related calc-alkaline magmatism (515\u2013436\u00a0Ma) implies that the initial subduction of the Proto-Tethyan oceanic crust occurred in the middle Cambrian and continued to the early Silurian (Zhang et al., 2010a, 2021; Li et al., 2013a; Li et al., 2014b; Li et al., 2015c; Liu et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016, 2020c; Zhou et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2018b). The cessation of subduction and the initiation of continental collision occurred at the middle Silurian, which is recorded by the high-Mg diorite-granodiorite that emplaced at 432\u2013427\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2014) and high-pressure eclogites and epidote amphibolites with peak metamorphic ages of 428\u2013427\u00a0Ma (Chen et al., 2002; Meng et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2016b; Bi et al., 2018, 2020; Song et al., 2018). In the late Silurian to middle Devonian (426\u2013390\u00a0Ma), the appearance of I-type granites, metaluminous A2-type granites, and mafic igneous rocks indicate that the EKOB was in a post-collision extension setting (Li et al., 2013b, 2020; Xin et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020a; Dong et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2021). Furthermore, molasses formation of the late Silurian to middle Devonian (423\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0Ma, Lu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b) also indicates a post-collision extensional event.\nWith the termination of the evolution of the Proto-Tethyan Ocean, the EKOB transformed into the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean tectonic domain. The 345\u2013308\u00a0Ma ophiolites in the SKL indicate that the opening of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean (A\u2019nyemaqen branch) was not later than the early Carboniferous (Chen et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011a; Liu et al., 2011b). The northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethyan oceanic crust began in the late Permian and continued to the end of the middle Triassic, which is indicated by 280\u2013240\u00a0Ma subduction-related arc magmatic rocks, mafic dikes, and volcanic rocks (Xiong et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015d, 2018a, 2018c; Ding et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2015; Ju et al., 2017). After 240\u00a0Ma, the syn-collisional granites widely distributed in the EKOB mark the closure of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean and the collision between the East Kunlun and the Bayan Har-Songpan-Ganze Terrane, while post-collisional granites and A-type granites with ages of 230\u2013200\u00a0Ma imply that the EKOB was in an extensional setting (Ding et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2016; Shao et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Qu et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). The collision is also evidenced by the angular unconformity between the Upper Triassic Babaoshan Formation and the underlying Middle Triassic Xilikete Formation (Li et al., 2012b). Moreover, asthenosphere upwelling, lithospheric delamination, or slab break-off may have occurred in the late Triassic (Luo et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Xin et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2020).\nBased on the discussion above, a possible genetic model for the Au mineralization of the Kunlun River area is illustrated in Fig. 16\n. The two orogenic events formed two regional boundary faults and a series of secondary faults in the EKOB, which provided favorable conditions for forming orogenic gold deposits in the Kunlun River area. Because the host rocks of these deposits include the early to middle Triassic Hongshuichuan and Changmahe Formations, the mineralization process may be more closely related to the evolution of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean. During the middle-late Triassic, the closure of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean resulted in metamorphism and deformation of the pre-late Triassic strata. In this process, the CO2-bearing ore-forming fluids and materials were released from the metamorphic sedimentary rocks due to the breakdown of hydrous minerals and pyrite (Pitcairn et al., 2006, 2015; Phillips and Powell, 2010; Tomkins, 2010; Large et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2015; Finch and Tomkins, 2017). In the late Triassic, the EKOB was transformed into a post-collisional extension setting. The release of tectonic stress caused the ore-forming fluids to migrate upward along the NWW- to NW-trending faults, resulting in the Au precipitation in the secondary faults of the shallower crust to form the auriferous quartz veins and altered rock-type gold ores due to the fluid immiscibility and fluid-rock interaction.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\n(1)\nThe gold deposits in the Kunlun River area have similar fluid compositions. The fluid inclusions of the main-ore stage quartz include two-phase aqueous inclusions, CO2-bearing three-phase inclusions, and pure CO2 inclusions. The ore-forming fluids belong to a H2O-CO2-NaCl system with moderate temperature and low salinity.\n\n\n(2)\nHydrogen and oxygen isotopic characteristics indicate that the ore-forming fluids were derived from metamorphic water. Carbon isotopic features show that carbon was sourced from marine carbonates. Sulfur and lead isotopic compositions suggest that the ore-forming materials were predominantly derived from sedimentary rocks.\n\n\n(3)\nBased on the ages of capture zircons in the auriferous quartz veins and the emplacement time of regional A-type granites, the gold mineralization time is confined between 239 and 200\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n(4)\nThe gold deposits in the Kunlun River area can be classified as orogenic gold deposits. Gold mineralization is associated with the collision orogeny in the middle to late Triassic, which resulted in the regional metamorphism of the pre-late Triassic strata and the liberation of CO2-bearing ore-forming fluids and materials. Subsequently, the ore-forming fluids migrate upward along the NWW- to NW-trending faults in the late Triassic post-collisional extension setting. Finally, gold deposition occurred under the mechanism of fluid immiscibility and fluid-rock interaction.\n\n\n\n\n","72":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nCarlin-type gold deposits are well-known in Nevada, USA, and the Youjiang basin, Southwest China, which are endowed with approximately 8000 and 800 tons of gold, respectively, making them the most important metallogenic provinces for Carlin-type gold deposits in the world (Muntean and Cline, 2018; Su et al., 2018). These deposits are mainly hosted in impure carbonate or calcareous and carbonaceous sedimentary rocks and are characterized by decarbonatization, silicification, sulfidation, and argillization (Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Cline et al., 2005; Cline 2018; Kesler et al., 2005; Muntean and Cline, 2018; Su et al., 2008, 2009a, b, 2012, 2018). Gold occurs mainly as invisible forms of structurally bounded Au1+ and\/or nanoparticles in arsenian pyrite (Simon et al., 1999; Palenik et al., 2004; Reich et al., 2005; Gopon et al., 2019; Su et al., 2008, 2012; Liang et al., 2020).\nThe process of Carlin-type ore formation is well understood. Sulfidation is recognized to be the most important mechanism of gold deposition, whereby gold and pyrite precipitated together from H2S-rich, Fe-poor fluids that reacted with Fe-bearing minerals in the host-rock package (Hofstra et al., 1991; Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Kesler et al., 2003; Cline et al., 2005; Cline 2018; Muntean and Cline, 2018; Su et al., 2009a, 2018; Kusebauch et al., 2019). Genetic model previously proposed for Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada and Youjiang basin falls into three groups involving magmatic (Ressel et al., 2000; Cline et al., 2005; Hou et al., 2016; Cline 2018; Muntean and Cline, 2018; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Zhu et al., 2019), metamorphic (Groves et al., 1998; Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Su et al., 2009a, 2018; Li et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021), and circulated meteoric waters (Ilchik and Barton, 1997; Hu et al., 2002; Emsbo et al., 2003) or basin brines (Gu et al., 2012). These models are mainly based on interpretations of sulfur isotope compositions of sulfides.\nHowever, the sulfur isotope compositions of ore pyrites in Nevada and Youjiang basin varied significantly within and between mining districts. For example, In Nevada, the \u03b4\n34S value of ore pyrite from the high-grade Meikle deposit in the northern Carlin trend and the Jerritt Canyon district is about +10\u2030 (Emsbo et al., 2003; Cline et al., 2005), whereas in the Getchell trend and Screamer section on the margin of Betze-Post deposit, the \u03b4\n34S value of ore pyrite is near zero (Kesler et al., 2005; Hofstra et al., 2011). In Youjiang basin, in-situ sulfur isotope analyses of ore pyrites from a cluster of carbonate-hosted gold deposits on the platform of the basin, including Shuiyindong, Taipingdong, Nibao, and Getang deposits, yielded a near zero of \u03b4\n34S value (Hou et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018b; Li et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021), whereas the ore pyrites from siliciclastic-hosted gold deposits in the basin such as Lannigou, Yata, Jinya, and Gaolong deposits have a large variation of \u03b4\n34S value (\u22124.5\u2030 to +18.1\u2030) (Su et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Lin et al., 2021). These ambiguous results led to interpretations for S isotope compositions either magmatic or sedimentary source or mixing of them (Muntean et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2016; Su et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018a, Xie et al., 2018b).\nThe development of laser ablation-multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS), sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) allow in situ analyses to distinguish trace elements and S isotope compositions between pre-ore and ore pyrites (Kesler et al., 2005; Large et al., 2007, 2009; Barker et al., 2009; Hou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Yan et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2021). In this study, we first use LA-ICP-MS and SIMS to determine trace element compositions and multiple sulfur isotopes (32S, 33S, and 34S) for pre-ore and ore pyrites from the Linwang Carlin-type gold deposit in the Youjiang basin, southwest China, to constrain the sources of reduced sulfur and metals. For comparison, we compiled in-situ \u03b4\n34S data from the literatures for pre-ore and ore pyrites and in-situ Au, As, and Sb contents of sedimentary pyrites from other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin. All data support a sedimentary source-rock of sulfur and metals and metamorphic ore fluids for Carlin-type gold mineralization in the Youjiang basin, southwest China.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology\nCarlin-type gold deposits in the southwestern China are restricted to the Youjiang basin (Fig. 1\n), which is bound by the Mile-Shizong fault to the northwest, by the Ziyun-Yadu fault to the northeast, and by the Pingxiang-Nanning fault to the southeast, which separates the basin from the Cathaysia block (Su et al., 2018). The southern edge of the Youjiang basin is dominated by metamorphic rocks of the North Vietnam terrane, which is separated from the Simao block by the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone (Du et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016).\nThe Youjiang basin (Fig. 1) was produced by Devonian rifting of the southwest margin of the Yangtze craton (Su et al., 2018) and has experienced successive development of passive continental margin rift basin (Early Devonian to early Permian), back-arc basin (Late Permian to Early Triassic), and foreland basin (Middle to Late Triassic) related to the opening, subduction and closing of the Paleo-Tethys ocean (Yang et al., 2012; Du et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). The basin consists of Precambrian to Ordovician basement and a cover sequence of Devonian to Triassic sedimentary rocks (Yang et al., 2020). The oldest basement rock is composed of ca. 799\u202fMa gneiss (zircon U-Pb dating; Yan et al., 2006) exposed in the Song Chay in the southern part of the Youjiang basin (Yang et al., 2020). A cover sequence of Devonian to Triassic sedimentary rocks is recorded throughout the basin. The Devonian strata mainly crops out in the southwestern part of the basin and consist of sandstone, siltstone, and shale that unconformably overlie Cambrian-Ordovician calcareous rocks and shale (Du et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2016). The Permian limestone and Triassic siltstone, sandstone, and mudstone are widely distributed throughout the basin (Fig. 1), with Permian rocks generally exposed in the cores of anticlines. Most of sedimentary rocks in the basin underwent low-grade burial metamorphism as recorded by illite crystallinites (Suo et al., 1998).\nThe basin sequences were deformed by two subduction-related tectonic events. In the southeastern part of the basin, W-verging subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the Eurasian plate during the Middle Permian caused NE-striking folding and faulting of the basin sequences and intensive felsic magmatism along the eastern margin of China (Li and Li, 2007), far from the Carlin-type gold deposits. In the southwestern part of the basin, NE-verging subduction of the Ailaoshan-Song Ma branch of the Paleo-Tethys ocean beneath the Indochina block during the Early Permian and controlled the evolution of the Youjiang basin (Lai et al., 2014; Zaw et al., 2014). Continued subduction eventually brought about the Indochina-South China collision (Indosinian orogeny) during the Late Permian to Middle Triassic (Zaw et al., 2014). Following the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic Indochina-Sibumasu collision (Yanshanian orogeny) and Cretaceous subduction of the Meso-Tethys oceanic plate beneath Sibumasu (Cai and Zhang, 2009; Zaw et al., 2014) led to intracontinental deformation and extension of the Youjiang basin, respectively. Extension may have caused emplacement of the Cretaceous quartz porphyry dikes (96\u202fMa: Chen et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2017) and lamprophyre dikes (88\u202fMa: Su, 2002; Liu et al., 2010) in the Youjiang basin. Su et al. (2018) suggested that the two compressional events contributed to formation of Middle-Late Triassic (232\u2013212\u202fMa) gold deposits on the southern margin (e.g., Anna, Zhesang, and Laozhaiwan, Table 1\n) and the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (148\u2013134\u202fMa) gold deposits on the northern margin of the Youjiang basin (e.g., Shuiyindong, Lannigou, and Nibao), which is divided by the Youjiang fault (Fig. 1).\nCarlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin occur in clusters around a series of NW-and NE-striking extensional faults (Fig. 1). The largest deposits are strata-bound and are hosted in Permian bioclastic limestone interbedded with calcareous siltstone and sandstone on the northern margin of the basin (e.g., Shuiyindong). Others are fault-controlled and occur along high-angle reverse faults and adjacent altered rocks in the basin, with ore hosted in the Triassic calcareous siltstone, sandstone, and mudstone (e.g., Lannigou). Smaller deposits occur in Cambrian to Triassic siliciclastic rocks and locally in Late Permian diabase intrusions on the southern margin of the basin (e.g., Anna). Although the ore controls vary, these deposits have many characteristics in common with Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada, including lithology of host rocks, mineral assemblages, alteration types, elemental associations, and occurrence of gold (Su et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018a).\n\n\n3\nGeology of the Linwang deposit\nThe Linwang deposit is located at the northern part of the Youjiang basin (Fig. 1). It lies on the northeastern flank of Leye isolated carbonate platform (Fig. 2\n) and occurs along high-angle reverse faults and adjacent altered rocks, with ore hosted in calcareous siltstone, sandstone, and mudstone of the Middle Triassic Banna and Baifeng Formations. Recent exploration and mining at the Linwang have proven gold reserves of 30 metric tons (t) Au (Gao, 2018), with average gold grades of 4\u202fg\/t (Chen et al., 2010).\nSedimentary rocks in the district consist of the Middle Permian limestone and the Lower-Middle Triassic siltstone, sandstone, and mudstone (Fig. 2). The Middle Permian Heshan Formation, a massive limestone, is overlain by the Lower Triassic Luolou Formation and the Middle Triassic Banna and Baifeng Formations. The Lower Triassic Luolou Formation consists of limestone and mudstone interbedded with limestone. The Middle Triassic Banna and Baifeng Formations are dominated by sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, which are divided into three members based on sand grain size and bedding thickness, respectively (Chen et al., 2010). Gold mineralization is mainly hosted in the second unit of the third member of the Banna Formation and the first and second units of the first member of the Baifeng Formation (Figs. 2 and 3\n), which are composed of siltstone and sandstone interbedded with mudstone. No coeval felsic intrusive rocks to date were observed in the vicinity of the Linwang deposits, with an exception at the Liaotun gold deposit where a 96\u202fMa quartz porphyry dike crosscuts the gold orebody (Fig. 1; Chen et al., 2014).\nGold mineralization (Figs. 2 and 3) occurs along a narrow N-S trending zone and comprises more than 10 orebodies (Chen et al., 2010). Most of them occur along high-angle and strike-slip faults that cut the east flank of the Leye anticline. The flank of the anticline dips at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0, locally containing chevron folds and mesoscopic compressive fracture zones. The largest orebody (I) is controlled by the F1 and F1-2 fault zones (Fig. 3) and contains\u202f\u223c\u202f65% of gold reserves at the Linwang (Chen et al., 2010), with ore hosted in the Middle Triassic Baifeng Formation. The mineralization zone is 600\u202fm long, 30 to 90\u202fm wide, and 40 to 160\u202fm thick, with average of gold grade of 4\u202fg\/t. Some orebodies occur as lens-shaped, veins, and vein stockworks within the Middle Triassic Banna Formation and are structurally controlled by secondary faults (Fig. 2). High-grade ore samples (7.33\u202fg\/t to 21.6\u202fg\/t Au) used in this study collected from the orebody (I) are characterized by a dense distribution of disseminated sulfides in silicified and brecciated siltstone, along with abundant barren milky quartz and calcite veinlets (Fig. 4\n).\nWall-rock alteration identified in this study includes decarbonatization, silicification, sulfidation, argillization (illite), and dolomitization, similar to those of the siliciclastic-hosted gold deposits in the Youjiang basin such as the Lannigou and Yata deposits (Su et al., 2009a; Xie et al., 2018a). Sulfides in the deposit consist mainly of arsenian pyrite, minor arsenopyrite and stibnite (Chen et al., 2010). Arsenian pyrite is the main host mineral for invisible gold (Gao et al., 2021).\nThe mineral paragenesis (Fig. 6\n\n) includes pre-ore minerals such as ferroan calcite and dolomite, detrital quartz, trace muscovite, apatite, rutile, kaolinite and disseminated pyrite that were likely incorporated into the host rocks during sedimentation and\/or diagenesis. Ore-related minerals are divided into two stages according to crosscutting relations and mineral assemblages. The ore stage minerals consist of barren quartz veinlets, arsenian pyrite, illite, and dolomite. The quartz veinlets are spatially associated with higher-grade ores, and arsenian pyrites are disseminated into the host rocks around quartz veinlets (Fig. 5m), we infer that the quartz veinlets are ore related. The late ore stage minerals are dominated by stibnite, vein quartz, calcite and dolomite, which commonly fill fractures and locally cement brecciated siltstone.\n\n\n4\nSamples and analytical methods\nSeven samples (Fig. 4) used in this study were collected from the largest orebody (I) at the open-pit of the Linwang deposit (Fig. 3). A total of 26 polished sections were prepared and examined using transmitted and reflected light microscopy to identify minerals and to observe morphology and texture. Sulfides and other minerals were further identified using a JXA8230 electron microprobe at the State Key Laboratory of Ore Deposit Geochemistry (SKLODG), Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, China. High-resolution images were obtained using a JSM-7800F scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the SKLODG, to illustrate the morphology and texture of pyrite, and provide precise locations for LA-ICP-MS and SIMS analyses.\n\n4.1\nIn situ trace element analysis of pyrite\nIn situ trace element analyses of pyrites from 7 polished sections were conducted using LA-ICP-MS at the In-situ Mineral Microanalysis Laboratory of the Ore Deposit and Exploration Centre (ODEC), Hefei University of Technology, China. The analyses were carried out on an Agilent 7900 Quadrupole ICP-MS coupled to a Photon Machines Analyte HE 193-nm ArF Excimer laser ablation system. The procedure and operation conditions were described in detail by Wang et al. (2017) and Du et al., (2021), which are summarized below.\nThe sample was ablated in an atmosphere of ultra-high purity He, which was used as a carrier gas (0.9\u202fL\/min.), and the resulting aerosol was mixed with Ar (0.87\u202fL\/min.) prior to introduction into the mass spectrometer. Ablation was performed using an energy density of 2\u202fJ\/cm2 and a laser pulse frequency of 8\u202fHz. The laser spot size used in this study is 20\u202f\u03bcm. The total acquisition time for each spot analysis was 60\u202fs, consisting of a 20\u202fs background measurement with the laser turned off and 40\u202fs peak signal measurement with the laser turned on. A 30\u202fs delay was instituted after each individual spot analysis to ensure that the ablation cell was effectively washed out and the gases had stabilized. During the spot analysis and mapping, the following isotopes were monitored: 34S, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 63Cu, 66Zn, 75As, 107Ag, 121Sb, 197Au, 201Hg, 205Tl, 208Pb, and 209Bi.\nMapping of pyrite was performed by ablating sets of parallel lines in a grid across the samples. Depending on the sample size, lines were ablated with a beam size of 10 or 20\u202f\u00b5m. The spacing between the lines was kept constant at the same size as the laser beam. The laser beam scan speed for each line was equal to the beam size per second. LA-ICP-MS trace element maps were generated over a period of 1.5 to 2\u202fh to keep the sensitivity of the instrument drift to a minimum.\nThe off-line data processing was performed using a program called ICPMSDataCal (Liu et al., 2008). Trace element compositions of samples were calibrated against multiple-references materials with applying iron as the internal normalization element. Analytical errors for trace elements in sulfides are less than 30% according to MASS-1 (Feng and Li, 2019). Images were compiled and processed using the laboratory software LIMS (designed based on Matlab, Wang et al., 2017). Analyses of the Linwang pyrite were calibrated using NIST610 glass and the MASS-1 synthetic sulfide reference material (Wilson et al., 2002).\n\n\n4.2\nIn situ S isotope analysis of pyrite\nTwo representative polished sections (LW-808 and LW-815) from the Linwang deposit were selected for the in situ SIMS S isotope analyses after LA-ICP-MS trace element analyses. Pyrites were sampled using a microdrill and cast in epoxy mounts. The epoxy mounts were carefully polished with diamond paste and coated by a gold layer with a thickness of about 30\u202fnm before SIMS analysis. The standards used in this study were PPP-1 (Gilbert et al., 2014) for pyrite. The SIMS measurements were conducted at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GIGCAS), using a CAMECA IMS 1280-HR instrument. The analytical parameters were similar to those described in Li et al. (2018) and are briefly summarized here: A primary beam of 133Cs+ ion (\u223c2.0\u202fnA current and 20\u202fkeV total impact energy) was focused on the sample surface with a spot diameter of 20\u202f\u00b5m. A 15\u202f\u00b5m raster was applied during all analyses to slightly homogenize the Gaussian beam. Presputtering for 20\u202fs was applied to remove the Au coating, and a normal-incidence electron gun was used for charge compensation. The mass resolving power was set at 5000 to avoid isobaric interferences. A NMR field sensor was applied to stabilize the magnetic field. 32S, 33S and 34S were measured simultaneously by three Faraday cups of the multicollection system (L2, L1 and H1, respectively). The amplifier gains were automatically calibrated before the start of the whole session. Total analysis time for one spot was about 4.5\u202fmin.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nPyrite type\nPyrite is the most abundant iron sulfide minerals in the Linwang deposit and is the main host mineral for gold (Chen et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2021). Based on pyrite morphology, texture, and chemistry, three types of pyrites are identified, including pre-ore pyrite (Py 1) and ore pyrites (Py 2 and Py 3) (Figs. 5 and 7\n).\nPre-ore pyrite (Py1) is framboidal (Fig. 7c), anhedral to euheral (Fig. 5c, f) pyrite and commonly occurs as a pyrite core with lower As and Au contents. This type of pyrite in the disseminated ores (Fig. 5g, j, and m) and pyrite veinlets (Fig. 7g) are partially replaced by As-rich and Au-poor pyrite 2 (Py 2; Figs. 5i, l, o, and 7h to l) .\nOre pyrites include an As-rich inner rim of pyrite (Py 2) and an Au-rich outer rim of pyrite (Py 3), which commonly formed overgrowth on the Py 1 (Figs. 5c, f, and 7h to l). The ore pyrites also formed individual, anhedral to euhedral pyrite crystals without the pyrite core (Py 1; Fig. 7h, k). The Py 2 and Py 3 are indistinguishable under the microscope as they have a similar yellowish-white color, bright reflectivity, and high relief. However, they are chemically distinct and can be distinguishable under backscattered electron (BSE) imaging adjusted for low brightness and high contrast; the Py 2 has brighter BSE imaging than that of the Py 3 and commonly rims the Py 1 (Fig. 5c, f) or replaced the Py 1 (Fig. 7h to l). The Py2 grains are anhedral to subhedral, with 5 to 30\u202f\u03bcm in diameters. The Py 3 commonly rims the Py 2 and has subhedral to euhetral crystal faces, generally more than 20\u202f\u03bcm in diameter. LA-ICP-MS analyses show that the Py 3 is the main host mineral for gold (Fig. 8\ne, f).\n\n\n5.2\nPyrite geochemistry\nA total of 289 spot analyses for trace elements were measured by LA-ICP-MS on the different types of pyrites from the Linwang deposit. The concentrations of trace elements in pyrites are included in Appendix 1 and displayed in Figs. 8\u201312\n\n\n\n. The average and median values of trace elements in each type of pyrite are listed in Table 2\n.\nPre-ore pyrite (Py 1) contains high Co (average\u202f=\u202f299\u202fppm), Ni (1,229\u202fppm), Pb (369\u202fppm), Zn (5.89\u202fppm), and Bi (7.54\u202fppm) (Table 2), compared to the ore pyrites (Py 2 and Py 3), which contain low Co (average\u202f=\u202f262\u202fppm to 68.9\u202fppm), Ni (978\u202fppm to 268\u202fppm), Pb (250\u202fppm to 149\u202fppm), Zn (1.29\u202fppm to 1.42\u202fppm), and Bi (5.38\u202fppm to 3.94\u202fppm). LA-ICP-MS spot analyses did detect Au in the Py 1 (Fig. 8a, b), with average of 11.6\u202fppm Au, As (36,739\u202fppm), Sb (245\u202fppm), Tl (0.94\u202fppm), Cu (493\u202fppm), and Se (35.7\u202fppm).\nFor ore pyrites (Table 2), the Py 2 (inner rim) has evaluated concentrations of Au (47.3\u202fppm), As (47,585\u202fppm), Sb (231\u202fppm), Tl (1.79\u202fppm), and Cu (799\u202fppm), and Se (41.0\u202fppm), compared to the Py 1. The trace element contents in the Py 3 (outer rim) contrasts with the Py 1 and Py 2 and has highest concentrations of Au (242\u202fppm), As (45,921\u202fppm), Sb (288\u202fppm), Tl (4.21\u202fppm), Cu (1,292\u202fppm), and Se (70.7\u202fppm).\nAll pyrites have similar range of Co\/Ni ratios between 0.01 and 1 (Fig. 10f). Box- and -whisker diagram (Fig. 9) shows that the average and median concentrations of Au, As, Sb, Tl, Cu, and Se in the pyrites generally increase and Co, Ni, and Pb contents decrease from Py 1 to Py 3, with positive correlations between Au and As, Sb, Tl, Cu, and Se (Fig. 10). LA-ICP-MS mappings (Figs. 11 and 12) show that the pre-ore pyrite (Py 1) is generally enriched in Co-Ni-Pb-Bi-Sb\u202f\u00b1\u202fAs, whereas the ore pyrite is enriched in Au-As-Sb-Cu-Tl-Hg, with higher As and lower Au concentrations in the inner rims of ore pyrite (Py 2) and significantly higher As, Au contents in the outer rims of ore pyrite (Py 3).\n\n\n5.3\nPyrite sulfur isotope compositions\nA total of 121 data of sulfur isotope compositions measured by SIMS on the different types of pyrites from the Linwang deposit are included in Appendix 2 and showed on Figs. 7 and 13\n. The average and median values of \u03b433S, \u03b434S, and calculated \u039433S in each type of pyrite are listed in Table 3\n.\nThe results show that all pyrites have similar ranges of \u03b433S, \u03b434S, and \u039433S values (Fig. 13a). The pre-ore pyrite (Py 1) has \u03b434S values ranging from +2.73\u2030 to +7.65\u2030 (average\u202f=\u202f+5.13\u2030) and \u03b433S values of +1.49\u2030 to +3.89\u2030 (average\u202f=\u202f+2.64\u2030), with the \u039433S values from \u22120.12 \u2030 to +0.13\u2030 (Appendix 2 and Table 3). The \u03b434S and \u03b433S values of ore pyrite 2 (inner rim) range from +3.51\u2030 to +5.85\u2030 (average\u202f=\u202f+4.84\u2030), +1.89\u2030 to +3.11\u2030 (average\u202f=\u202f+2.52\u2030), respectively, with the \u039433S values from \u22120.06\u2030 to +0.15\u2030. Ore pyrite 3 (outer rim) has similar ranges of \u03b434S values (+3.80\u2030 to +6.09\u2030, average\u202f=\u202f+4.53\u2030) and \u03b433S values (+2.00\u2030 to +3.10\u2030, average\u202f=\u202f+2.32\u2030), with the \u039433S values from \u22120.18\u2030 to +0.14\u2030 as compared with the Py 1 and Py 2.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nPyrite formation\nPyrite is the most abundant iron sulfide minerals in Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin and is the main host mineral for gold (Su et al., 2018). There are several generations of pyrite in the deposits, which have been described in detail by previous workers (Su et al., 2008, 2009a, b, 2012, 2018; Hou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Li et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Xie et al (2018b) outlines criteria for interpretation of pyrite timing based on occurrence, morphology, texture, and chemistry of pyrite: (1) pre-ore pyrite is framboidal and anhedral to euheral pyrite, dominated in low-\/no-grade host rocks, and commonly occurs as a pyrite core with high Co, Ni and low As contents, which is interpreted a diagenetic origin; (2) ore-pyrite commonly rims pre-ore pyrite and contains an As-rich, Au-poor inner rim, and an As- and Au-rich outer rim, which are interpreted later hydrothermal origin.\nFor the Linwang deposit, pyrite formation can be divided into two stages: (1) pre-ore stage of pyrite and (2) hydrothermal stage of ore pyrite (Fig. 6). The pre-ore stage of pyrite consists of pyrite 1 (Py 1) and occurs as a core. It is commonly rimmed by ore pyrites (Py 2 and Py 3), demonstrating that it formed before the ore pyrites (Figs. 5c, f and 7c to f). The pre-ore pyrite has framboidal (Fig. 7c), anhedral to euheral textures (Fig. 5c, f), and contains higher average concentrations of Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, Bi, and lower As than those of the ore pyrites (Table 2), similar to the pre-ore pyrite in other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin, such as Shuiyindong, Jinfeng (Lannigou), Yata, and Jinya deposits (Hou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Li et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Large et al. (2009) and Gregory et al. (2015) used LA-ICP-MS to analysis global sedimentary (diagenetic and syngenetic) pyrites in carbonaceous shale and several sediment-hosted orogenic and Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada and demonstrated that they contain abundant As, Ni, Pb, Cu, and Co. In addition, the Co\/Ni ratio has been widely used to classify the origin of pyrite. Sedimentary pyrite generally exhibits low Co\/Ni ratio of\u202f<\u202f1 (Large et al., 2009; Gregory et al., 2015). Pre-ore pyrite in the Linwang deposit exhibits textural and chemical similarities and low Co\/Ni ratio of\u202f<\u202f1 to these sedimentary pyrites, suggesting that it formed during sedimentation and\/or diagenesis.\nGold in the pre-ore pyrite (Py 1) was commonly detected in this study by LA-ICP-MS spot analyses (Fig. 8a, b). Gold concentrations in the Py 1 range from 1.82\u202fppm to 65.2\u202fppm (n\u202f=\u202f63; Appendix 1 and Table 2), with average of 11.6\u202fppm Au, As (36,739\u202fppm), Sb (289\u202fppm), Tl (0.94\u202fppm), Cu (493\u202fppm), and Se (35.7\u202fppm). For comparison, we compiled available published LA-ICP-MS data of Au, As, and Sb contents for the pre-ore pyrites from other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin (Table 4\n and Fig. 15), we found that the pre-ore pyrite in these deposits also contain ppm level of Au, with higher contents of As and Sb. For example, the pre-ore pyrites from the giant Shuiyindong deposit contain average of 2.12\u202fppm Au (n\u202f=\u202f28), As (11,065\u202fppm), and Sb (111\u202fppm) (Hou et al., 2016; Jin, 2017; Xie et al., 2018b). In the north Carlin trend, Large et al. (2009, 2011) reported that the diagenetic pyrite in the carbonaceous sedimentary rocks contains higher Au (9.54\u202fppm to 168.71\u202fppm), As (2085.4\u202fppm to 6575.1\u202fppm), and Sb (531.5\u202fppm to 1239.9\u202fppm) and proposed that the diagenetic pyrite is a potential source of metals for formation of Carlin-type gold deposits in Nevada. The diagenetic pyrite in the Youjiang basin containing Au, As, and Sb supports this hypothesis, but more in situ data of Au, As, and Sb contents in the diagenetic pyrite from more deposits and districts in the Youjiang basin are needed to investigate in the future. Initial source of Au, As, and Sb enriched in the diagenetic pyrites in the Youjiang basin is unknown, they could be initially sourced from Permian Emeishan basalt or tuff, because the outcrops of magmatic rocks in the Youjiang basin are dominated by Permian Emeishan basalts, with thickness ranging from tens to hundreds of meters (Zhu et al., 2019). Petroleum exploration drillings also show that a thick sequence of the Emeishan basalts or tuff is buried hundreds of meters beneath the basin (Huang, 1986).\nThe pyrite textures, chemical zonation, and relationships to quartz\u202f\u00b1\u202fstibnite veinlets (Fig. 5 a, g, m, and 7a, g) indicate that the ore pyrites in the Linwang were produced by later hydrothermal fluids. Hydrothermal ore pyrites commonly have an As-rich, Au-poor inner rim (Py 2) and an As- and Au-rich outer rim (Py 3). These textures have been observed in other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin, such as Jinfeng, Yata, and Jinya deposits (Hou et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Li et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Xie et al. (2018a, b) interpreted the inner rim of pyrite in the Jinfeng deposit as the pre-ore pyrite and could have precipitated from an Au-free but As-rich of an early hydrothermal fluids or from low-Au and As-rich fluids at the beginning of the ore stage. However, in the Linwang deposit the inner rim of pyrite (Py 2) commonly contains Au (Table 2), with average of 47.3\u202fppm Au (n\u202f=\u202f36), As (47,585\u202fppm), Sb (231\u202fppm), Tl (1.79\u202fppm), and Cu (799\u202fppm), and Se (41.0\u202fppm). We interpret that the inner rim of pyrite in the Linwang deposit precipitated from the ore fluids at the beginning of the ore stage, following deposition of the outer rim of pyrite (Py 3) on the Py 2, with higher Au (242\u202fppm, n\u202f=\u202f191), As (45,921\u202fppm), Sb (288\u202fppm), Tl (4.21\u202fppm), Cu (1292\u202fppm), and Se (70.7\u202fppm). This suggestion is evidenced by continuous growth of small pyrite crystals (Fig. 7h) and a lack of replacement at the interface between the Py 2 and Py 3 (Figs. 5 c, f, l, and 7f, k). On the Au vs. As diagram (Fig. 10 a), all pyrites form a wedge-shaped zone and plot below the solubility limit of gold in pyrite determined by Reich et al. (2005), suggesting that Au may occur as invisible form of structurally bounded Au1+ in pyrites.\nThe mechanism attributing to chemical differences of Py 2 (inner rim) and Py 3 (outer rim) in the Linwang deposit as well as other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin is unknown. Liang et al. (2021) used the focused ion beam combined with scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques to examine invisible gold in arsenian pyrite from the Shuiyindong and Jinfeng deposits in the Youjiang basin and Getchell and Cortez hills deposits in Nevada. This study confirmed that the ore pyrite in the Carlin-type gold system was formed during rapid crystallization and Au was principally incorporated into the crystal structure of arsenian pyrite (Reich et al., 2005; Kusebauch et al., 2018, 2019; Muntean and Cline, 2018). The process of rapid pyrite crystallization requires significant changes in ore fluid conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, and\/or mixing with other fluids). Fluid inclusion measurement and oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of ore fluids for the Linwang deposit (Luo et al., 2019), as well as other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin (Su et al., 2009a, 2018), indicate no significant changes in temperature (230\u202f\u00b1\u202f30\u202f\u00b0C) for the ore fluids and mixing with other fluids, suggesting that the temperature change of the ore fluids and mixing with other fluids are not the main factor attributing to chemical differences of the ore pyrites (Py 2 and Py 3). High-grade ores (Fig. 4c, d) in the Linwang deposit are spatially associated with hydraulic brecciation of silicified wall rocks, implying higher pressure of the ore fluids that can permeate and reacted with the ferroan dolomite cements and partially replaced the pre-ore (diagenetic) pyrite in the host rocks, possibly forming the inner rim of pyrite (Py 2) at the beginning of the ore stage. Rapid drops in pressure resulting from fault failure may lead to the more ore fluids flowed upward into structural highs where they reacted with Fe-bearing minerals in the host rocks to precipitate the outer rim of Au-rich pyrite (Py 3) on the Py 2.\n\n\n6.2\nSources of sulfur and metals\nIn the Carlin-type gold system, ore fluids were enriched in reduced S (Hofstra et al., 1991; Hofstra and Cline, 2000; Su et al., 2009a, 2018; Muntean and Cline, 2018). As gold was principally transported as a bisulfide complex (Seward, 1973, 1991; Stef\u00e1nsson and Seward, 2004), Au cannot have been sourced at depths than the S, the S isotope data can provide insights into Au sources (Hou et al., 2016).\nSulfur isotopic signature (\u03b4\n34S) of sulfide has been used for decades to constrain sulfur sources and processes in hydrothermal ore deposits (Ohmoto, 1972). However, the \u03b4\n34S signature is sensitive to a range of mineralizing processes, it is difficult to interpret the \u03b4\n34S data and distinguish between the influence of the sulfur source reservoirs and the effect of changes in thermodynamic conditions affecting the sulfur-bearing fluid as it is transported and deposited (Sugiono et al., 2021), making it not be an unambiguous constraint on the sulfur source for hydrothermal ore deposits (Santiago et al., 2021).\nIn most chemical reactions, the sulfur isotope ratios obey mass-dependent fractionations (MDF); however, significant mass-independent fractionation (MIF, \u039433S) anomalies were identified in pyrite and barite from Archean sedimentary rocks, which was caused by SO2 photolysis in the atmosphere (Farquhar et al., 2000; Pavlov and Kasting, 2002: Bekker et al., 2004; Ohmoto et al., 2007; Johnston, 2011; Masterson et al., 2011; Philippot et al., 2012). The MIF-S signature is also known to persist through magmatic recycling processes. It has been detected within lavas associated with mantle plumes (Cabral et al., 2013) and magmatic intrusions (LaFlamme et al., 2018) and in diamond-hosted inclusions (Smit et al., 2019), which is interpreted to be recycled from subducting slabs of Archean crust. The MIF-S signature adds another dimension to direct constraint on sulfur source for orogenic gold system (Xue et al., 2013; Steadman et al., 2015; Agangi et al., 2016; Gregory et al., 2016; Selvaraja et al., 2017a, b, c; LaFlamme et al., 2018; Sugiono et al., 2021).\nIn the Linwang deposit, all pyrites have narrow range of \u03b434S values (Fig. 13a; Table 3), with average of +5.13\u2030 for pre-ore pyrite 1, +4.84\u2030 for ore pyrite 2 (inner rim), and +4.53\u2030 for ore pyrite 3 (outer rim), suggesting the S of ore pyrites was mainly derived from a sedimentary source. In addition, all data of \u03b433S and \u03b434S for pyrites are plotted on the mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) line (Fig. 13b; \u03b433S\u202f=\u202f0.515\u202f\u00d7\u202f\u03b434S, Hulston and Thode, 1965). A near zero \u039433S signature in all pyrites in the Linwang deposit (Table 3) indicates no record of the assimilation of Archean sulfur that have MIF-S signatures in the Archean sedimentary or metamorphic rocks, implying the deep basement of Archean rocks beneath the basin were not involved the formation of the Linwang deposit. On the \u039433S vs. \u03b434S diagrams (Fig. 13c, d), all pyrites are plotted between a volcanic SO2 (Ono et al., 2003) and Permian seawater sulfate reservoirs (Zhang et al., 2015), and overlap with sedimentary pyrites in Permian-Triassic boundary in South China (Zhang et al., 2015; Saitoh et al., 2017), but have different array of \u039433S-\u03b434S from the ore-related pyrites and sedimentary pyrites in Permian Maokou and Heshan or Wujiaping Formations in the Youjiang basin (Zhang et al., 2015). These data suggest that the S within the Linwang deposit was most likely sourced from the Triassic sedimentary rocks that host the deposit rather than the Permian sedimentary rocks. In addition, the diagenetic pyrites (Py 1) in the Linwang commonly contain ppm level of Au, with higher contents of As and Sb (Fig. 15), suggesting that the diagenetic pyrites in the host rocks are a potential source of Au for the formation of the Linwang deposit.\nIn the other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin, available in-situ \u03b4\n34S data for the pre-ore and ore pyrites are compiled from the literatures for comparison (Fig. 14\n\n). The \u03b4\n34S values of the pre-ore and ore pyrites varied significantly within and between mining districts. For example, the deposits on the platform that host in the Permian bioclastic limestone, siltstone and argillite (e. g. Shuiyindong and Taipingdong) and the Permian basalt tuff or volcaniclastic rocks (e. g. Nibao) have a broad range of \u03b4\n34S values (\u221233.8\u2030 to +17.9\u2030) for the pre-ore pyrites, and a narrow range of \u03b4\n34S values (\u22125\u2030 to +5\u2030) for the ore pyrites (Hou et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018a, b; Li et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Such a broad variation of \u03b4\n34S values for the pre-ore pyrites is consistent with sedimentary pyrites (\u221248.5\u2030 to +15.1\u2030) in the Permian Maokou and Heshan or Wujiaping Formations in South China (Zhang et al., 2015). In the central basin, the deposits that host in the Triassic siliciclastic rocks have a narrow range of \u03b4\n34S values for the pre-ore and ore pyrites in each deposit, such as Lannigou, Yata, Banqi, and Jinya deposits. Hou et al. (2016) and Xie et al. (2018b) interpreted the broad range of \u03b4\n34S values for the pre-ore pyrites as the result of bacterial reduction from marine sulfate during sedimentation and diagenesis, and the narrow range of \u03b4\n34S values for the ore pyrites is a deep magmatic S source for the ore fluids.\nAlthough the \u03b4\n34S values for the pre-ore and ore pyrites in each deposit are variable, however, the median of \u03b4\n34S values for the ore pyrites overlap with that of the pre-ore pyrites (Fig. 14). In addition, the diagenetic pyrites in other deposits in the Youjiang basin also contain ppm level of Au, with higher contents of As and Sb (Fig. 15). These data also suggest that the S and Au were mainly derived from a sedimentary source rather than a deep magmatic S source, because no coeval felsic intrusive rocks were observed in the Youjiang basin or in the vicinity of the deposits.\n\n\n6.3\nSource of ore fluids and precipitation processes\nAs quartz veinlets are spatially associated with high-grade ores in the Linwang deposit (Fig. 4), it is inferred that these veinlets are ore related. Fluid inclusion measurement and oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of quartz veinlets from the Linwang have been reported by Luo et al. (2019). The quartz veinlets contain two-phase, liquid-rich aqueous and two- or three-phase aqueous-carbonic fluid inclusions, with an average homogenization temperature of 230\u202f\u00b0C and salinity of 5.4\u202fwt% NaCl equiv., similar to other deposits in the Youjiang basin (Su et al., 2009a, 2018). They have a narrow range of high \u03b418O values (21.7\u2030 to 26.5\u2030). Calculated \u03b418OH2O values for fluids vary from +11.7\u2030 to +16.5\u2030 at 230\u202f\u00b0C; the measured \u03b4DH2O values of water extracted from fluid inclusions in the quartz veinlets range from \u221271\u2030 to \u221257\u2030, which plot within or close to the metamorphic-water box on the \u03b418OH2O \u2013 \u03b4DH2O diagram (Luo et al., 2019, Fig. 5), suggesting that the ore fluids of the Linwang deposit are consisted predominantly of metamorphic fluids.\nThe Linwang deposit shares many characteristics with other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin, including the host rocks, mineral assemblages, alteration types, element associations, and residence of gold. It may have ore precipitation mechanisms similar to other deposits. Petrographic observations show that the ferroan dolomite cements in sandstone and siltstone formed during sedimentation are partially replaced by quartz and followed by deposition of tiny arsenian pyrite and illite in pore space (Fig. 5h, k), indicating that the ore precipitation processes of the Linwang are similar to other deposits in the Youjiang basin in that gold and pyrite precipitated together from H2S-rich, Fe-poor fluids that reacted with Fe-bearing minerals in the host rocks (Su et al., 2009a, 2018; Xie et al., 2018a, b). Arsenic, Cu, Sb, and Tl were incorporated into the ore pyrites during sulfidation process. Locally, irregular boundaries between the pre-ore and ore pyrites (Fig. 7h to l) suggest that replacement in addition to sulfidation may have been important in the formation of ore pyrites.\nAlthough accurate age of gold mineralization for the Linwang deposit is not constrained by isotope dating, a zircon U-Th\/He age of 133\u202fMa from the mineralized rocks in the Linwang has been reported by Gao et al. (2021) and is interpreted as gold mineralization age, corresponding to Yanshanian orogeny. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of ore fluids indicate a metamorphic origin (Luo et al., 2019). Such metamorphic ore fluids were generated by regional metamorphism of sedimentary rocks, possibly related to crustal thickening and prograde metamorphism during the late Yanshanian orogeny (Su et al., 2009a, 2018). The ore fluids were focused into the main fault zones and then flowed upward into structural highs in response to stress relaxation during the orogeny. Gold and pyrite precipitated together where the ore fluids reacted with Fe-bearing minerals in the host rocks to have formed the Linwang deposit.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe results of this study of pyrite textures, paragenesis and multiple S isotopes and trace element geochemistry at the Linwang deposit support the model of Su et al. (2009a, 2018), who suggested that the S and Au were introduced by metamorphic fluids for the Carlin-type gold mineralization in the Youjiang basin.\nOur results have clearly shown that Au was initially trapped in the structure of fine-grained (framboidal) sedimentary and diagenetic forms of arsenian pyrite (Py 1) within the siltstone and mudstone during sedimentation and diagenesis. Late compressional tectonic event associated with the Yanshanian orogeny could led to the release of Au, As and Sb from previously dissolved in the diagenetic pyrite (Py 1) to the metamorphic fluids. Such fluids were focused into the main fault zones and flowed upward into structural highs in response to stress relaxation during the orogeny. Gold and pyrite precipitated together where the ore fluids reacted with Fe-bearing minerals in the host rocks, which commenced with the deposition of As-rich pyrite (Py 2), followed by Au-rich pyrite (Py 3).\nThis two-stage process of sedimentary (diagenetic) Au-bearing arsenian pyrite and gold deposition is key to the formation of the Linwang deposit and may apply to the genesis of other Carlin-type gold deposits in the Youjiang basin.\n\n","73":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nVein-type Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic deposits occur in a wide variety of hydrothermal systems and make a significant contribution for the Pb, Zn and Ag (Beaudoin and Sangster, 1992; Box et al., 2012; Kissin and Mango 2014; Song et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a,b,c). The common characteristics of this kind of deposits can be summarized as follows (Baumgartner et al., 2009; Bendezu and Fontbote, 2009; Zhai et al., 2020; Beaudoin and Sangster, 1992): (1) orebodies generally occur as open-space fillings (veins, breccia bodies) and structurally controlled by faults in silicate host rocks; (2) they form under epithermal conditions at shallow levels beneath the paleosurfaces; (3) they include Pb-Zn-Ag-(\u00b1Cu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Au\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Bi\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Sb\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0As) metal suites, with ore minerals consisting of galena, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, Ag-bearing sulfides and Ag-sulfosalts and gangue minerals comprising quartz and carbonates (e.g. calcite, dolomite, rhodochrosite and siderite); (4) the hydrothermal alteration is dominantly by silicification, sericitization and carbonatization. Previous studies have demonstrated that most of these veins are genetically associated with magmatic centers, including porphyry (Sillitoe, 2010; Catchpole et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017a,b; Rottier et al., 2018a; Rottier et al., 2018b), greisens (Jackson et al., 1989; Cunningham et al., 1991; C\u0115rny et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2005) and skarns system (Einaudi et al., 1981; Meinert et al., 2005). In terms of space, these polymetallic veins in the magmatic hydrothermal environment occur in the periphery of, adjacent to, or superimposed on the early porphyry, greisens or skarn-type mineralization (Seedorff et al., 2005; Sillitoe, 2010). However, some polymetallic veins hosted in sedimentary rocks or metamorphic rocks of greenschist amphibolite facies appear to have no link to magmatic intrusions (Leach et al., 1988; Lynch et al., 1990; Beaudoin et al., 1991; Johnson et al., 1996; Joncas and Beaudoin, 2002; Paiement et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). As a result, it is of both scientific and economic interest to investigate whether these polymetallic base metal deposits have close association in time and space with igneous activity.\nIn the past 30\u00a0years, a series of vein-type Pb-Zn-Sg-Ag polymetallic deposits (e.g., Zhaxikang, Keyue, Zedang, Suoyue and Jisong) hosted in the Jurassic strata have been observed in the eastern part of North Himalaya Metallogenic Belt (NHMB), southern Tibet (Fig. 1\nb. These base-metal deposits are characterized by the presence of Ag-bearing sulfosalt minerals and Fe-Mn-bearing carbonates (Xie et al., 2017, 2015; Duan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020a,b), which are consistent with those of Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic deposits. However, various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the ore genesis of these deposits, including hot-spring deposit (Meng et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009a,b; Li et al., 2014), SEDEX modified by hot spring and\/or magmatic hydrothermal fluids (Zheng et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017a,b, 2018a, 2019a,b, 2020a,b), intermediate-sulfidation epithermal (Xie et al., 2017, 2015) and magmatic hydrothermal deposit controlled by tectono-magmatic processes (Duan et al., 2016). Especially for the source of ore-forming fluids, previous fluid inclusions and D-O isotope studies have not provided sufficient evidence that can unequivocally link the Pb-Zn-Sg-Ag mineralization with magmatic hydrothermal fluids.\nAs one of these Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag polymetallic deposits, Keyue is a medium-sized deposit that is located within the NHMB. Given that the geological characteristics of Keyue are similar to the adjacent super-large sized Zhaxikang Pb-Zn polymetallic deposit, some researchers consider them to be classified into the same type mineralization (Zhang and Ciren, 2012). To date, the Keyue Pb-Zn-Ag-Sb deposit remains poorly understood. Based on the analyses of fluid inclusions and sericite 40Ar-39Ar dating, Lin et al. (2016a) suggested that Keyue is a medium\u2013low temperature hydrothermal vein-type deposit resulting from post-collision of India plate and Eurasian plate. By contrast, Wang et al. (2018b) proposed that Keyue is the product of multiple events, with the initial SEDEX mineralization modified by later magmatic hydrothermal fluids. Overall, the key to constrain the genesis of Keyue is to evaluate that whether it is related to magmatic water or not. Furthermore, limited studies have focused on the precipitation mechanism for different kinds of ore-forming elements, including Pb, Zn, Ag and Sb.\nIn this contribution, fluid inclusions, Laser Raman spectroscopic analysis and S-Pb-C-H-O isotopes were carried on the hydrothermal minerals from different ore-forming stages at Keyue, aiming to clarify the source of ore-forming fluids and metals, as well as the precipitation mechanism for Pb-Zn-Ag-Sb. Combined with the geological characteristics and previously published geochronology, the genetic relationship between Keyue Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag mineralization and Cuonadong leucogranite was discussed, which is significant for further exploration in the deposit and elsewhere in the NHMB.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nAs an important component of the Cenozoic Himalayan-Tibetan orogen, the Himalayan Terrane is located between the Lhasa Terrane and the Indian Continent (Fig. 1a. From north to south, the Himalayan Terrane is conventionally subdivided into four individual tectonic units, including the Tethyan Himalayan Belt (TH), High Himalayan Crystalline Rock Belt (HH), Low Himalayan Fold Belt (LH), and Sub-Himalayan Tectonic Belt (SH) (Fig. 1a. The NHMB is situated in the eastern section of the TH and separated by the Indus Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone (IYZS) to the north and the South Tibet Detachment System (STDS) to the south (Fig. 1a; Burchfiel et al., 1992; Pan et al., 2012; Burg and Bouilhol, 2019).\nThe NHMB is composed of Precambrian metamorphic crystalline basement and overlying Paleozoic-Mesozoic low-metamorphic marine deposits (Zhu et al., 2013). The Precambrian metamorphic crystalline basement of Lhagoi Kangri Group (Laguigangri Group) crops out in the core of several gneiss domes (e.g., Yelaxiangbo, Ranba, Kangma, and Cuonadong) and is composed of Meso- to Neo-Proterozoic greenschist-amphibolite facies metasedimentary rocks (e.g., schist, gneiss), migmatite, gneiss and amphibolite (Pan et al., 2004; Liao et al., 2008), along with Paleoproterozoic (1812\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0Ma, Liao et al., 2008), Neoproterozoic (809.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0Ma, Xia et al., 2019), and Cambrian (536\u2013478\u00a0Ma; Wang et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 201a,b) granitic gneiss. The less exposed Paleozoic strata are represented by the Lower Permian sedimentary sequence around the Kangma metamorphic core complex, mainly consisting of conglomerate, sandstone, marble and silty slate. Mesozoic strata are widespread in the NHMB and composed of a set of Triassic-Cretaceous flysch formations, resulting from turbidite deposits in neritic-bathyal environments. Lower-middle Triassic strata mainly comprise shallow-marine sandstone and slate, whereas the Upper Triassic strata consist of deep-water shelf-facies sandstone slate interlayered with volcanic rocks. Jurassic strata are composed of shelf-facies slate, sandstone, and limestone, intercalated with volcanic rocks. The main lithologies of Cretaceous strata are clastic and carbonate rocks interbedded with volcanic rocks.\nThe Mesozoic and Cenozoic intrusions and volcanic rocks are widespread in the NHMB and the lithologic associations distinctly differ in different tectonic settings (Fig. 1b. The Mesozoic igneous rocks are dominated by the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous mafic rocks with a small amount of acidic volcanic rocks, which are formed in passive continental margin rift. The Mesozoic mafic rocks consisting of basalts, mafic dikes\/sills and gabbro intrusions are interpreted to be formed due to the interaction between lithospheric mantle and OIB-type mantle or asthenosphere depleted mantle. In contrast, acidic volcanic rocks formed in response to the remelting of felsic continental crust. The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks (bimodal magmatism) (147\u2013135\u00a0Ma) in the Cuomei-Jiangzi area were considered to be an important component of the Comei-Bunbury large igneous province, forming during the initial stage of rifting between Great India and Australia (Zhu et al., 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013; Li et al., 2020). The Cenozoic magmatic rocks are characterized by the occurrence of leucogranites, which resulted from the partial melting of metamorphic crystalline basement during the post-collision period (Zhang et al., 2004, 2005; Zeng et al., 2009, 2012; Gao et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020). The Eocene (46\u201335\u00a0Ma) leucogranites were formed due to partial melting of amphibolite under crustal-thickening conditions (Zeng et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014). The Late Oligocene to Miocene (28\u20139\u00a0Ma) leucogranites are interpreted to be the products of partial melting of metapelitic rocks caused by significant decompression in the stage of intracontinental extension and deformation (Yu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2016).\nFolds and faults are well developed in the NHMB in response to the Cenozoic collision orogeny. In the early stage of collision, extensive compression resulted in the formation of a series of nearly EW-trending thrust faults and EW-trending compound folds, as well as local metamorphism in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous strata (Yin, 2000; Hou et al., 2004). The subsequent extension triggered the formation of STDS (23\u201311\u00a0Ma, Yin and Harrison, 2000; Yin, 2006), North Himalayan gneiss domes and NS-trending normal faults (25\u00a0Ma to the present, Yin et al., 1999).\nThe NHMB is characterized by the occurrence of abundant Au, Au-Sb, Sb and Pb-Zn-Sb-(Ag) deposits. These deposits are mainly controlled by the STDS, NS-trending rifts and the dome structure. The Au deposits (e.g., Bangbu, Zhemulang, Langkazi) are mainly hosted in the Triassic strata, whereas the Sb-Au (e.g., Mazhala, Gudui and Zhegu) and Pb-Zn-Sb-(Ag) (e.g., Zhaxikang and Keyue) deposits occur in the Jurassic strata. For the Sb deposits (e.g., Shalagang and Cheqiongzhuobu), they are hosted in both the Jurassic and Cretaceous strata. It is noteworthy that Sn-W-Be polymetallic mineralization (Cuonadong) related to Miocene leucogranite have also been discovered in the NHMB (Fig. 2\n, suggesting that the Himalayan region has significant potential for Sn-W-Be polymetallic mineralization (Fig. 1b; Wang et al., 2017a,b; Li et al., 2017a,b; Cao et al., 2020, 2021; Xie et al., 2020).\n\n\n3\nOre deposit geology\nThe Keyue deposit is located in the east of NHMB and next to the well-known Zhaxikang large-scale Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag deposit (Fig. 1b and 2. The Pb, Zn, Sb and Ag reserves at Keyue are 232,100\u00a0t, 172,648\u00a0t, 81,261\u00a0t and 711.8\u00a0t, with average grades of 3.00%, 2.44%, 1.15% and 100.72\u00a0g\/t, respectively (Zhang and Ciren, 2012).\nThe outcropped strata at Keyue are only the Lower Jurassic Ridang Formation (Fig. 3\na, which are dominated by the black carbonaceous slate and calcareous slate, intercalated with siltstone and dolomite-bearing argillaceous microcrystalline limestone. The diabase dikes intruded into the Jurassic Ridang Formation and yielded a LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age of 138.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0Ma (Zhou et al., 2018a). The diabase dikes are commonly altered with local Pb-Zn-Sb mineralization due to interaction with the hydrothermal fluids.\nTwo sets of faults are identified in the Keyue area, including the NE-trending faults controlling the distribution of orebodies and WE-trending faults without any mineralization. The NE-trending F1 fault measures about 1600\u00a0m in length and 100\u00a0m in width, with dip angle of 50\u00b0\u201370\u00b0. As an extensional fracture, the F1 fault is steep at the top and gentle at the bottom and characterized by the occurrence of tectonic breccia. In contrast, the F2 fault is more than 500\u00a0m long and 1\u201315\u00a0m wide, with dip angles ranging from 55\u00b0 to 70\u00b0.\nSeven Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag polymetallic orebodies have been identified at Keyue and are controlled by the NE-trending faults. The largest and economically most important No. 1 orebody, hosted by fault F1, is about 1400\u00a0m long and 0.7\u201339.8\u00a0m (average 10.1\u00a0m), vertically extending to a depth of 200\u2013450\u00a0m (Fig. 3).\nThe main ore minerals are sphalerite, galena, stibnite, bournonite, jamesonite and pyrite, followed by chalcopyrite, boulangerite and Ag-bearing tetrahedrite (Figs. 4\u20136\n\n\n). Gangue minerals mainly include Mn-bearing siderite, quartz, sericite and calcite (Figs. 4 and 5. The ore textures are dominated by the open-space fillings, including veins, stockwork, veinlet-disseminated and breccia, with massive ores locally developed (Figs. 4 and 5).\nBased on the crosscutting relationships of veins, mineral assemblages and alteration types, three ore-forming process stages were recognized (Fig. 7\n. Sphalerite-pyrite-siderite\/rhodochrosite\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0quartz (Mn-Fe Carbonate-sulfide) stage (I) is characterized by the occurrence of Mn-Fe carbonate, sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite (Figs. 4a\u2013f and 5a\u2013e. The Mn-Fe carbonate and the coexisting sulfides generally occur as veins crosscutting rocks of the Jurassic Ridang Formation or cementing the fragments of wall rocks (Figs. 4a and 5b\u2013c. In some cases, Mn-Fe carbonate occurs as lattice-bladed and hosts coarse-grained euhedral sphlerite (Fig. 4c. A small amount of euhedral pyrite and asenopyrite are disseminated in Mn-Fe carbonate (Fig. 5a and c. Galena commonly replaced sphalerite (Fig. 5b. Stage II mineral assemblages are dominated by the quartz, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and various kinds of sulfosalt minerals (Figs. 4d\u2013g, 5f\u2013l and 6). The stage II quartz-sulfide veins generally crosscut the stage I Mn-Fe carbonate-sulfide veins (Fig. 4d\u2013f and 5d\u2013e. Stage III, the youngest mineralization, consists of an assemblage of quartz, calcite and stibnite, which commonly occur as veins crosscutting minerals of all previous stages (Fig. 4h\u2013i).\nThe hydrothermal alteration is dominated by the Fe-Mn carbonatization and silicification, followed by sericitization and chloritization. The earlier Fe-Mn carbonatization is closely associated with the Zn-mineralization (Fig. 4a\u2013c and 5d\u2013e). In contrast, the later silicification commonly overprinted the earlier Fe-Mn carbonatization (Fig. 5d\u2013e) and is related to the Pb-Zn-mineralization in stage II (Fig. 5e) and Sb-mineralization in stage III (Fig. 4i).\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical methods\n\n4.1\nFluid inclusion\nSiderite and sphalerite from stage I, quartz from stage II, and calcite and quartz from stage III were collected for fluid inclusion study. Doubly polished sections ca. 100\u00a0\u03bcm thick were prepared for detailed examination of the fluid inclusions according to the criteria outlined by Roedder (1984). Fluid inclusion microthermometry was conducted using a Linkam THMSG600 heating-freezing stage combined with a Nikon microscope at the MNR Key Laboratory of Tectonic Controls on Mineralization and Hydrocarbon Accumulation at the Chengdu University of Technology. The thermocouples were calibrated by measuring the melting temperatures of pure water (0.0\u00a0\u00b0C) and pure CO2 (\u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C) using synthetic fluid inclusions. The measurement accuracy of phase transitions in fluid inclusions was\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C for temperatures below 0\u00a0\u00b0C, \u00b10.5\u00a0\u00b0C between 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0\u00b0C, and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C between 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C. Heating and cooling rates were controlled at 20\u00a0\u00b0C\/min during heating or freezing processes most of the time, and were reduced to\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C for ice-melting temperature and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C for homogenization (T\nh, L\u00a0+\u00a0V\u00a0\u2192\u00a0L) and halite-dissolution temperatures (T\nm-halite).\n\n\n4.2\nLaser Raman microspetrometry (LRM)\nThe volatile and solute compositions of different kinds of fluid inclusions in stages I and II were examined using a Renishaw Raman spectroscope (RM2000) at the Analytic Center of the Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology (BRIUG), Beijing, China. The source was an argon-ion laser with wave length of 514.53\u00a0nm and a laser power of 20 nW. The area of the charge-coupled device detector was 20\u00a0\u03bcm2, and the spectral scanning range was set between 1000 and 4200\u00a0cm\u22121 for vapor and liquid compositions, with an accumulation time of 30\u00a0s for each scan and a spectral resolution of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0cm\u22121.\n\n\n4.3\nIsotope analysis\nHydrothermal sulfides from different stages were collected for S-Pb isotope analysis. Stage I Mn-bearing siderite, stage II quartz and stage III calcite were selected for H-O isotope analysis. Furthermore, the same samples of stage I Mn-bearing siderite and stage III calcite were collected for C-O isotopic studies. The fresh samples were crushed to a 40\u201360 mesh size. Based on the field investigations and microscopic observations, minerals were manually separated under a binocular microscope. The purity of each mineral separate was more than 99%. All mineral separates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath before being milled in an agate mortar. All the isotope analyses were carried out at the Analytical Laboratory of the Research Institute of Uranium Geology in Beijing, China.\nThe O isotopic compositions of Mn-beaing siderite (I), quartz (II) and calcite (III) were analyzed following the BrF5 method (Clayton et al., 1972). The \u03b4D values of fluid inclusions in minerals were analyzed using the Zn reduction method (Coleman et al, 1982). The H2 and CH4 from the fluid inclusions were first oxidized to H2O by passing through a CuO furnace at a temperature of 550\u00a0\u00b0C. Subsequently, all H2O was combined and converted to H2 by reacting with Zn in a vacuum line. The C isotopic analyses of CO2 were performed by quantitatively reacting carbonate samples with phosphoric acid at a temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The \u03b418O, \u03b4D and \u03b4C values isotopes were determined on a Finnigan MAT253-type mass spectrometer. The H-O isotope results are reported relative to the Mean Ocean Water Standard (SMOW) with the precisions of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u2030 for \u03b4D and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030 for \u03b4\n18O, respectively. The C isotope analysis results adopted the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) as standards with a precision of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030.\nThe samples for S-Pb isotope analyses were analyzed using a Delta V Plus mass spectrometer and an IsoProbe\u2010T Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer instrument for S and Pb isotopes, respectively. Sulfides were oxidized to SO2 for S isotope analysis by quantitative oxidation using Cu2O. The \u03b434S values were reported relative to the Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite standard (V\u2010CDT) with a precision of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2030.\nSamples for Pb isotope analysis were dissolved in a mixed solution of HF and HClO4 in crucibles, followed by basic anion exchange resin to purify the Pb. In contrast to 1\u00a0\u03bcg Pb, the precisions of Pb isotopes are lower than 0.05% for 204Pb\/206Pb and better than 0.005% for 208Pb\/206Pb, respectively.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nFluid inclusion types and occurrences\nBased on the components and phase behavior at room temperature (\u223c20\u00a0\u00b0C), as well as the phase transitions during cooling and heating process, six types of inclusions were recognized at Keyue (Figs. 8\u201311\n\n\n\n: H2O-rich bi-phase aqueous inclusions (type I), pure CO2 inclusions (type II), CO2-rich H2O-CO2-NaCl tri-phase inclusions (type III), H2O-rich H2O-CO2-NaCl tri-phase inclusions (type IV), halite-bearing tri-phase aqueous inclusions (type V) and halite-bearing H2O-CO2-NaCl multiphase inclusions (type VI). Type I, type IV and type VI inclusions homogenize into liquid H2O phase, whereas type III inclusion homogenize into vapor CO2 phase (Figs. 9 and 11. Type II inclusions homogenize into vapor (Fig. 9 or liquid CO2 phase (Fig. 10. For the type V inclusions, halite minerals dissolved before (Fig. 11 or after the disappearance of vapor. Types I and IV inclusions occur in stage I siderite and sphalerite (Fig. 8a\u2013c. All these types of inclusions were identified in stage II quartz (Fig. 8d\u2013k), whereas only type I inclusions occur in stage III calcite and quartz (Fig. 8l.\nFluid inclusions are dominated by the primary inclusions, which occur in clusters, as scatters and isolations. Small amount of secondary inclusions were observed in long trails crosscutting crystal boundaries. Although the different types of fluid inclusions are relatively close to each other, and they are considered as primary or pseudosecondary inclusions, they cannot be unambiguously defined as being entrapped at the same time, thus not qualifying as fluid inclusion assemblages (FIA) as defined by Goldstein and Reynolds (1994).\nType I inclusions comprise a liquid phase and vapor phase, with vapor percentage generally <30%. Type II inclusions contain only CO2 phase, without any H2O phase. These inclusions consisting of both liquid and vapor CO2 homogenize into vapor (Fig. 8e); Type II-a inclusions with vapor CO2 percentage greater than 50 %) or liquid CO2 (Fig. 8d); Type II-b with vapor CO2 percentage lower than 50%), respectively. Other type II inclusions commonly homogenize into a mono-phase at room temperatures (Fig. 8f). For the liquid CO2 inclusions, a tiny bubble will appear and continue to become bigger during cooling process, and the bubble become smaller and eventually homogenize into liquid phase with temperature increase (Fig. 10). By contrast, the liquid CO2 phase will gradually appear along the edge of the vapor CO2 inclusions and become bigger during cooling process. When the temperature increases back, the vapor phase will expand and eventually homogenize into vapor phase (Fig. 9). Type III inclusions are composed of liquid plus vapor CO2 and liquid H2O, with CO2 volumetric proportions >50%. Type IV inclusions also comprise liquid plus vapor CO2 and liquid H2O, but with CO2 volumetric proportions <50%. Type V inclusions comprise a liquid phase, a vapor phase and a halite crystal, with vapor phase percentage <30%. Type VI inclusions are composed of liquid plus vapor CO2, liquid H2O and a halite crystal, with CO2 volumetric proportions <50 %. Types I to V inclusions in stage II quartz account for 25%, 20%, 32%, 8% and 14%, respectively. Only two type VI inclusions were identified in stage II quartz.\n\n\n5.2\nFluid inclusion microthermometry\nMicrothermometric analysis was performed principally on possibly primary or pseudosecondary fluid inclusions in the hydrothermal minerals. Fluid inclusions of secondary origin or with large vapor bubbles were excluded for microthermometry. Given that no well-defined FIAs were found in this study, the criterion for consistent microthermometric data (the differences of T\nh, total within individual FIAs being less than 15\u00a0\u00b0C) as proposed by Goldstein and Reynolds (1994) cannot be strictly applied. However, the FIA concept was still used to verify the consistency of fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of neighboring fluid inclusions (Chi and Lu, 2008). The neighboring fluid inclusions show similar homogeneous temperatures, positively indicating a homogeneous trapping without significant modification after entrapment. The final melting temperatures of ice (T\nm, ice), solid minerals (T\nm, s) and CO2 clathrate (T\nm, cla) were measured to calculate salinities according to the formula proposed by Potter et al. (1978), Hall et al. (1988) and Collins (1979), respectively. A summary of data from this study are shown in Table 1\n and Fig. 12\n.\nType I inclusions in stage I siderite and sphalerite homogenize at temperatures from 250.1 to 289.3\u00a0\u00b0C (average 266.4\u00a0\u00b0C). The T\nm,ice vary from \u221212.4 to \u22126.3\u00a0\u00b0C (average \u22129.2\u00a0\u00b0C), corresponding to the salinities of 9.6\u201316.3\u00a0wt% NaCleq (average 12.9\u00a0wt% NaCleq).\nType I inclusions in stage II quartz have total homogenization temperatures (T\nh,total) and T\nm,ice values ranging from 175.5 to 282.7\u00a0\u00b0C (average 236.2\u00a0\u00b0C) and \u221218.8 to \u22122.4\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, corresponding to the salinities of 4.0\u201321.5\u00a0wt% NaCleq (average 13.3\u00a0wt% NaCleq). The final melting temperatures of solid CO2 (T\nm,CO2) of types II, III and IV inclusions range from \u221256.6 to \u221257.3\u00a0\u00b0C, lower than the standard triple point (\u221256.6\u00a0\u00b0C) of the pure CO2, suggesting that the CO2 phase may contain CH4, N2, H2S and\/or other volatiles in addition to CO2. This is further evidenced by the testing results of Laser Raman Spectroscopy. Type II inclusions homogenize at temperatures of 26.1\u201330.5\u00a0\u00b0C (average 29.2\u00a0\u00b0C). For the type III and type IV inclusions, the T\nm,cla vary from 3.5 to 10.0\u00a0\u00b0C (average 8.9\u00a0\u00b0C), yielding salinities of 0.0\u201311.3\u00a0wt% NaCleq (average 2.1\u00a0wt% NaCleq). The CO2 phase homogenize into vapor or liquid CO2, with temperatures ranging from 23.5 to 30.9\u00a0\u00b0C. Type III and type IV inclusions display T\nh,total values of 188.8\u2013287.5\u00a0\u00b0C (average 250.5\u00a0\u00b0C). Type V inclusions homogenize at temperatures of 198.3\u2013266.0\u00a0\u00b0C (average 227.5\u00a0\u00b0C). Halite generally dissolved at temperatures of 161.5\u2013224.8\u00a0\u00b0C (average 200.0\u00a0\u00b0C), corresponding to salinities of 30.5\u201333.2\u00a0wt% NaCleq (average 31.9\u00a0wt% NaCleq).\nType I inclusions in stage III quartz and calcite have T\nh,total values of 172.3\u2013240.7\u00a0\u00b0C (average 199.1\u00a0\u00b0C). The T\nm,ice values range from \u22128.8 to \u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C (average \u22125.0\u00a0\u00b0C), yielding salinities of 3.1\u201312.6\u00a0wt% NaCleq (average 7.7\u00a0wt% NaCleq).\n\n\n5.3\nCompositions of the fluid inclusions\nType I inclusions in stage I siderite and Types I, II and III inclusions in stage II quartz were measured using Laser Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 13\n). The spectral data indicate that the vapor phase of type I inclusions in stage I contains CO2 (characteristic peak at 1284\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1386\u20131390\u00a0cm\u22121) in addition to H2O (Fig. 13a). For the type I inclusions in stage II, the vapor phase comprises CO2 and minor CH4 (characteristic peak at 2913\u20132919\u00a0cm\u22121) (Fig. 13b). Type II inclusions are dominated by CO2 phase, with minor CH4 and N2 (characteristic peak at 2328\u20132333\u00a0cm\u22121) (Fig. 13d\u2013e). For type III inclusions, the vapor and liquid CO2 phase contain minor CH4 in addition to CO2, whereas the aqueous phase contain minor CO2 in addition to H2O (Fig. 13f\u2013g).\n\n\n5.4\nIsotope geochemistry\nThe \u03b418Omineral, \u03b413Cmineral, \u03b4DH2O and calculated \u03b418OH2O values of hydrothermal minerals from different stages are listed in Table 2\n and Figs. 14 and 15\n\n. The \u03b418OH2O values calculated using mineral\u2013water fractionation equation and fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures are also listed in Table 2 and Fig. 14. The \u03b418OH2O values of siderite, quartz and calcite were calculated using fluid inclusion homogenization temperature and mineral-water fractionation equations, including the 1000ln\u03b1 siderite\u2013water\u00a0=\u00a04.23\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\/T2\u00a0\u2212\u00a04.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\/T\u00a0+\u00a01.73 (Zheng et al., 2000), 1000ln\u03b1 quartz\u2013water\u00a0=\u00a03.38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\/T2\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.40 (Clayton et al., 1972) and 1000ln\u03b1 calcite-water\u00a0=\u00a02.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\/T2\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.89 (O\u2019Neil et al., 1969).\nThe \u03b4DH2O, \u03b418Omineral and \u03b413Cmineral values of stage I siderite range from \u2212108.2\u2030 to \u221293.4\u2030, 12.7\u2030 to 14.6\u2030 and \u22127.3\u2030 to \u22126.7\u2030, respectively. The \u03b4DH2O and \u03b418Omineral values of stage II vary from \u2212112.3\u2030 to \u2212107.0\u2030 and 15.5\u2030 to 16.8\u2030, respectively. Stage III calcite samples yield \u03b4DH2O, \u03b418Omineral and \u03b413Cmineral values that range from \u2212124.1\u2030 to \u2212106.4\u2030, 14.6\u2030 to 17.2\u2030 and \u22126.7\u2030 to \u22122.9\u2030, respectively. The calculated \u03b418OH2O values of stage I siderite, stage II quartz and stage III calcite range from 4.95\u2030 to 6.85\u2030, 5.93\u2030 to 7.23\u2030 and 4.66\u2030 to 7.26%, respectively.\nThe S-Pb isotopes of hydrothermal sulfides from different stages at Keyue are listed in Tables 3 and 4\n\n and Figs. 16 and 17\n\n. The \u03b434S values of sulfides from stages I to III range from 10.0\u2030 to 10.3\u2030 (average 10.2\u2030), from 7.2\u2030 to 8.1\u2030 (average 7.6\u2030) and from 4.8\u2030 to 7.8\u2030 (average 6.3\u2030), respectively. The sulfides from stages I to III have 206Pb\/204Pb ratios ranging from 18.865 to 19.785, 207Pb\/204Pb ratios from 15.741 to 15.909 and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios from 39.504 to 40.457, respectively.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nFluid evolution and phase separation\nThe occurrence of types I and III inclusions, results from fluid inclusion microthermometry, CO2 composition detected in vapor phase of type I inclusions and abundant Mn-bearing siderite in stage I indicate that the fluids belong to H2O-NaCl-CO2 system with medium temperature and medium salinity. Furthermore, mineralogical and fluid inclusion evidence listed below suggests that fluid immiscibility occurred in stage I. The presence of platy carbonates is a strong indicator for fluid immiscibility (Fig. 4c). This hypothesis has been evidenced by the studies of active geothermal systems (Browne and Ellis, 1970; Browne, 1978; Keith and Muffler, 1978; Henley and Brown, 1985; Simmons and Christenson, 1994) and thermodynamic studies (Drummond and Ohmoto 1985; Reed and Spycher, 1985; Simmons and Browne 2000). The release of CO2 to the vapor phase during fluid immiscibility leads to a pH increase in the solution, causing the rapid precipitation of Mn-bearing siderite (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the carbonates commonly presenting a bladed habit occur in the deeper part of the mineralized zone and are restricted to a vertical zone near the site of first fluid phase separation (Simmon and Browne, 2000). Apart from mineralogical evidence, H2O-NaCl-CO2 fluid immiscibility is also demonstrated by the occurrence of types I and III inclusions (Fig. 8a\u2013b).\nIn contrast to stage I, stage II is characterized by the occurrence of abundant CO2-bearing and halite-bearing inclusions (Fig. 8d\u2013k). Laser Raman analysis indicates that the vapor phase of both types II and III inclusions contain CH4 and minor N2 in addition to CO2 (Fig. 13b\u2013h). Combined with the data from microthermometry, it is inferred that the ore-forming fluid in stage II is an immiscible H2O-NaCl-CO2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0N2 system composed of multi-components and multi-phases with medium to low temperature and contrasting salinities. Evidence from fluid petrography and microthermometry illustrate that fluid phase separation have also took place in stage II, including the early fluid immiscibility and later fluid boiling. Early fluid immiscibility was supported by a series of observations as listed below: (1) the coexistence of types I, II and III inclusions within microdomains (Fig. 8f) and 10; (2) types I and III inclusions occurring close to each other commonly homogenize at similar temperature but contrasting homogenization modes (Fig. 9); into aqueous liquid and carbonic vapor phases, respectively). Later fluid boiling was evidenced by the evidence: (1) type III inclusions coexist with type V (Figs. 8k and 11) or VI inclusions (Fig. 8j; (2) the coexisting type III inclusions with low salinity and density and type V inclusions with high salinity and density display similar homogenization temperatures, and they homogenize into the CO2 vapor and aqueous liquid, respectively (Fig. 11). Although types I, III and V inclusions locally occur close to each other, it is unlikely they were entrapped simultaneously due to the common fluid phase separation, because the three fluid phases (a relatively low-salinity liquid, a CO2-rich vapor, and a high-salinity liquid) cannot coexist (Baker, 2002; Chi et al., 2017; Vikent'eva et al., 2018). Considering the higher volatility of CO2 and CH4 than water vapor, a natural progression for depressurizing fluids may be from early immiscibility to later boiling (Giggenbach, 1980, 1997; Lynch et al., 1990; Baker, 2002). As a result, it is likely that fluid immiscibility occurred at a relatively early time in the hydrothermal history, whereas types V and VI inclusions with high salinity represent a relatively late fluids resulting from boiling of an evolving H2O-CO2-NaCl\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0CH4 fluid system. Similar hydrothermal fluid evolution was also common in the intrusion-related gold systems at relatively deeper environments, which contain abundant low-salinity, CO2-rich fluids that are postdated by moderate- to high-salinity brines (Baker and Lang, 2001; Lang and Baker, 2001; Baker, 2002; Vikent'eva et al., 2018).\nFor stage III, only type I inclusions were recognized in calcite and quartz, without any other types of inclusions. In contrast to stages I and II, the ore-forming fluids of stage III display lower T\nh, total (average 199.1\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinities (average 7.7\u00a0wt% NaCleq). It is therefore suggested that the ore-forming fluids in stage III are characterized by the CO2-free fluids with low temperatures and salinities, maybe resulting from the significant loss of CO2 due to phase separation in stages I and II and mixing with large amount of meteoric water.\n\n\n6.2\nSource of ore-forming components\nThe presence of CO2-rich and halite-bearing fluid inclusions sets Keyue apart from orogenic Au (Roedder, 1984; Wilkinson, 2001; Goldfarb et al., 2005), MVT (Roedder, 1984; Pelch et al., 2015) and SEDEX (Leach et al., 2004, 2010; Mahmoodi et al., 2018) Pb-Zn deposits, but is similar to that of magmatic hydrothermal systems (Baker, 2002; Chen et al., 2007), such as intrusion-related Au (Lang and Baker, 2001; Baker, 2002), granite-related W-Sn (Roedder, 1984; Wilkinson, 2001), porphyry Mo\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Cu (Rusk et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b; Mao et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2019; Ni et al., 2020) and IOCG (Pollard, 2006; Oliver et al., 2008) deposits. In addition to CO2, the fluid inclusions in stage II also contain minor CH4 and N2 (Fig. 13b, d, e and f. It is noteworthy that the fluid associations and compositions in stages I and II at Keyue closely resemble those of fluid inclusions in beryl and quartz from the pegmatite in the Cuonadong Dome (Xie et al., 2017, 2015) and hydrothermal minerals in the Cuonadong Sn polymetallic deposit (Cao et al., 2021), also indicating a magmatic water in origin. Such a hypothesis is further supported by the uniform and narrow \u03b418OH2O values of ore-forming fluids from different stages, which range from 4.7\u2030 to 7.3\u2030 and are consistent with that of magmatic waters (\u03b418OH2O\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u20139.0\u2030, Taylor, 1974). In the diagram of \u03b418DH2O-\u03b418OH2O (Fig. 14), the \u03b418DH2O-\u03b418OH2O data of hydrothermal fluids from different stages at Keyue distinctly differ from and plot far away from the field of typical SEDEX (Samson and Russell 1987; Canet et al., 2003, 2005) and VMS (Casey and Taylor, 1982; de Ronde, 1995; Huston and Taylor, 1999; Pisutha-Arnond and Ohmoto, 1983) deposits, whereas are closely consistent with those of Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic deposits with magmatic origin (Campbell et al., 1984; Ouyang et al. 2013; Ouyang et al., 2014; Ouyang et al., 2015; Zhai et al., 2018) and Cuonadong pegmatite-skarn-type Sn polymetallic deposits (Cao et al., 2021). The presence of melt, melt-fluid and fluid inclusions in beryl and quartz from the pegmatite (\u223c19.5\u00a0Ma) in the Cuonadong Dome records a magma-hydrothermal transitional condition, suggesting that the primary magmatic fluids resulted from the melt-fluid immiscibility (Xie et al., 2017, 2015). Furthermore, the occurrence of Mn-Fe carbonates and daughter gahnite minerals hosted in the fluid inclusions in beryl indicates high Mn-Fe-Zn contents in the CO2-bearing magmatic hydrothermal fluids exsolved from the Cuonadong pegmatite (Xie et al., 2017, 2015). In terms of timing, the sericite separated from Pb-Zn ores at Keyue yield a 40Ar\/39Ar age of 21.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0Ma (plateau age), which is closely consistent with the age range of Cuonadong leucogranite complex (23.7\u201315.2\u00a0Ma; Lin et al., 2016b; Li et al., 2017a,b; Gao et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a,b). In combination with the occurrence of abundant Mn-bearing siderite and sphalerite and CO2-rich inclusions in stage I, as well as the distal distance (\u223c28\u00a0km) between Cuonadong Dome and Keyue, it is therefore believed that the hydrothermal fluids at Keyue were initially sourced from the magmatic water exsolved from the hidden causative intrusions of the same suite as the outcropping Cuonadong leucogranite rocks, with increasing input of meteoric water with time.\nThe aforementioned scenario of magmatic water in origin is also supported by the C-O isotopic compositions of Mn-bearing siderite in stage I and calcite in stage III. The absence of graphite and sulfate minerals at Keyue suggests that the Mn-bearing siderite and calcite formed under reducing environment and have carbon isotopic compositions in equilibrium with the ore-forming fluids (Ohmoto, 1972; Ohmoto and Goldhaber, 1997). Thus, the \u03b413CPDB values of Mn-bearing siderite and calcite (ranging from \u22127.3\u2030 to 6.7\u2030 and \u22126.7\u2030 to \u22122.9\u2030, respectively) representing the \u03b413C\u2211C values of hydrothermal fluids are higher than those of sedimentary organic matter (-35\u2030\u2013\u221215\u2030 with an average of \u221225\u2030; Hoefs, 2009) and lower than those of marine carbonate (-4\u2030\u20134\u2030 with an average of 0\u2030; Veizer and hoefs, 1976; Hoefs, 2009), but rather consistent with those of magmatic or mantle carbon (\u22125 to \u22128\u2030; Taylor, 1986) and the hydrothermal calcite from Cuonadong Sn polymetallic deposits (\u22128.6\u2030 to \u22127.8\u2030; Cao et al., 2021). These data indicate that the magmatic intrusions may have contributed a significant proportion of carbon into the hydrothermal fluids (Ohmoto, 1972). In the \u03b413CPDB-\u03b418OSMOW diagram (Fig. 15), the Mn-bearing siderite in stage I plot within the area between the igneous carbonate and marine carbonate, with a straight line close to the igneous carbonate, suggesting affection due to low temperature alteration. In contrast to the Mn-bearing siderite, the stage III calcite has higher \u03b413CPDB and \u03b418OSMOW values with positive shift, indicating a small amount of sedimentary carbon involved into the ore-forming fluids.\nSulfide minerals usually exhibit enrichments in radiogenic Pb isotopes and depletions in U and Th. Due to the negligible changes with physicochemical conditions during the process of leaching, the Pb isotopes of sulfides are a powerful tool to trace the sources of metals in ore deposits (Zartman and Doe, 1981; Goldfarb et al., 2004; Bozkaya, 2011). The lead isotopic compositions of sulfides from stages I to III vary widely and have high 207Pb\/204Pb, 208Pb\/204Pb and \u03bc values ranging from 15.741 to 15.909, 39.504 to 40.457 and 9.6 to 10.1 (Table 3), respectively, indicating that the lead were mainly derived from upper crust that is enriched (with enrichment) in U and Th (Zartman and Doe, 1981). On the Pb evolution and discrimination diagrams (Fig. 16, the Pb isotope data mainly lies above the upper crust curve, further suggesting the predominance of continental crustal sources for the Keyue deposit. It is worth noting that the Pb isotopic compositions of sulfides from Keyue presenting as a steep linear arrays are closely consistent with those of sulfides from Zhaxikang, Cenozoic leucogranite and Precambrian metamorphic crystalline basement in the NHMB (Fig. 16. Previous studies illustrate that the Himalayan metamorphic crystalline complex with various kinds of lithology is enriched in Zn, Co, Cd, Mn and Pb (Li et al., 2014). Compared with the average values of these elements from the shale all over the world, the enrichment factors of Zn-Co-Cd and Pb in the Himalayan crystalline complex are greater than 5 and 3, respectively, with Mn in the range of 2\u20133 (Li et al., 2014). Himalayan leucogranite generated by the decompression melting of metamorphic crystalline domains have high Pb contents ranging from 21 to 131\u00a0ppm (Guo and Wilson, 2012; Gao et al., 2019\uff1bHuang, 2019; Xie et al., 2020). In addition, as one important accessory mineral, garnet in Himalayan leucogranite display Mn, Fe and Zn enrichment (Gao et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2019). As mentioned above, the hydrothermal fluids exsolved from pegmatite within the Cuonadong Dome contain high Mn, Fe and Zn contents (Xie et al., 2017, 2015). All the aforementioned evidence indicate that the process from leucogranite melts resulted from partial melting of crystalline complex, through melt-fluid transformation and into fluid evolution is accompanied by the activation, migration and enrichment of Pb, Zn and Mn. Taking in account that the ore-forming fluids at Keyue were magmatic water in origin, it is therefore believed that the Pb and Zn were mainly sourced from the concealed causative Himalayan leucogranite.\nThe presence of mineral assemblage of sphalerite-galena-stibnite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-sulfosalt minerals in primary ores and CH4 components in fluid inclusions, as well as the absence of sulfate minerals, suggest that the ore-forming fluids of Keyue have a relatively low oxygen fugacity. Hence, the \u03b434S values of sulfides from Keyue ranging from 4.8 to 11.2\u2030 (average 8.3\u2030) could be approximately equal to the \u03b434S\u03a3 values of ore-forming fluids (Ohmoto, 1972; Ohmoto and Goldhaber 1997). These Sulfur isotopic data are consistent with those of Jurassic-Cretaceous strata in the NHMB (Fig. 17; 6.4\u201315.9\u2030 with an average of 10.9\u2030; Sun et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020a,b) and slightly lower than those of sulfides from Cuonadong Sn-polymetallic deposit and Cuonadong leucogranites (Cao et al., 2021), indicating the contribution of sulfur from the ore-hosting strata. However, granite may display various \u03b434S values (\u221210.0 to 11.5\u2030) resulting from the influence of magma source, assimilation or wall-rocks and differentiation degree of crystallization (Rollison 1993; Zhou et al., 2018c). Take into account that the initial ore-forming fluids of Keyue were magmatic fluids exsolved from Cuonadong leucogranite\/pegmatite, it is inferred that the sulfur in the ore-forming fluids show characteristics of mixture of magmatic and sedimentary sulfur. In fact, the Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag polymetallic deposits at the outer edges of the magmatic ore systems have various types of wall-rocks and commonly underwent mixing between initial magmatic water and later groundwater, resulting in the broad and different \u03b434S values at different deposits within the same metallogenic belt (Fig. 17c). The deposits with \u03b434S values around 0\u2030 generally have magmatic sulfur source, such as the Bairendaba, Weilasituo and Shuangjianzishan deposits in the Great Hinggan Range in NE China (Ouyang et al., 2013, 2014; Zhai et al., 2020). In contrast, the deposits with wide range of \u03b434S values display the characteristic of sulfur derived from mixture of magma and local country-rock sources, such as the Dalong deposit in the Nanning ore belt in China (Xiong et al., 2019) and the tin-polymetallic deposits in the Eastern Cordillera of the Bolivian Andes (Sugaki et al., 1990).\n\n\n6.3\nMechanism for Zn-Pb-Ag-Sb precipitation\nIn the case of the Pb-Zn-Ag-Sb polymetallic veins and vein fields associated with magmatic centers (skarn-, greisen- and porphyry-type deposits), ore precipitation may have been caused by (1) fluid phase separation (fluid immiscibility or boiling), (2) fluid cooling, (3) fluid mixing, or (4) fluid-rock interaction (Aud\u00e9tat et al., 2000; Catchpole et al., 2015; Lynch et al., 1990; Wang et al., 2019a\u2013c; Wu et al., 2018; Xiong et al., 2019, 2020; Zhai et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a,b). In general, Pb, Zn and Ag are most efficiently transported as bisulfide complexes under reducing and sulfur-rich environment with medium to low temperatures at epithermal level (Seward, 1973; Henley et al., 1984; Gammons and Barnes1989; Heinrich et al., 1999). Therefore, the stability of metal\u2013ligand complexes acts as a crucial factor controlling the precipitation and dissolution of sulfide minerals. Considering that H2S is more soluble than CO2 and N2 in liquid water, it is likely that H2S will be lost proportionally less than CO2 in the evolving magmatic-hydrothermal fluids (Giggenbach, 1980; Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985; Andr\u00e9-Mayer et al., 2002). Thus, CO2 will initially escape due to fluid immiscibility of H2O-CO2-CH4-NaCl fluid system in stage I and earlier time in stage II, and H2S will be lost subsequently resulting from fluid boiling in later time in stage II. As a consequence, pH will increase due to CO2 and H2S loss and promote the destruction of hydrosulfide complexes and precipitation of abundant sphalerite, galena and Ag-bearing sulfides (e.g., galena and tetrahedrite) (Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985; Cole and Drummond, 1986).\nThe ore-forming fluids in stage III decrease in both temperature and salinity and are composed of aqueous without CO2. The occurrence of euhedral and coarse-grained stibnite with drusy textures indicate slow changing or very mildly fluctuating conditions in an open space during crystal growth. Thus, it is believed that cooling and dilution due to mixing with CO2-free meteoric water triggered the stibnite precipitation.\n\n\n6.4\nGenetic model and implications for further exploration\nRecently, a series of W-Sn-Be pegmatite-skarn-type mineralization have been recognized within the Cuonadong Dome and are genetically associated with the Miocene (ca. 20\u201314\u00a0Ma) leucogranite magmatic hydrothermal activity (Xie et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2021). For the Pb-Zn-Sb polymetallic deposits (e.g., Keyue, Zhaxikang and Jisong) adjacent to or in the periphery of the Cuonadong Dome, the sericite 40Ar\/39Ar ages range from 21.3 to 16.6\u00a0Ma (Lin et al., 2016b; Sun et al., 2018; Liang and Zheng, 2019), which are contemporary with both the leucogranitic magmatism and W-Sn-Be mineralization in the Cuonadong Dome (Cao et al., 2020, 2021; Xie et al., 2020). In combination with the geochronological, fluid inclusions, isotopic evidence, it is therefore suggested that the Cuonadong W-Sn-Be (e.g., Cuonadong, Dongga and Nading) and Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag mineralization (e.g., Keyue, Zhaxikang and Jisong) at different locations around the Cuonadong Dome constitute an integrated magmatic-hydrothermal system (Fig. 18\n, with the distal end-member Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag veins centered on the Cuonadong leucogranites-related W-Sn-Be skarn-type mineralization. Similar cases have also been recognized in the Southern Great Xing\u2019an Range in China (Ouyang et al., 2013; Zhai et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2019; Wang et al., 2019a,b,c), Naling Region W-Sn metallogenic belt in southeastern China (Wu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Xiong et al., 2019) and Eastern Cordillera of the Bolivian Andes (Thorn, 1988; Sugaki et al., 1990, 2003; Slater et al., 2019), where mineralized granites commonly show a zonal distribution of the related ore deposits, with Sn-, W-, Mo\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0As-dominated deposits occurring proximal to the intrusion and Cu-, Zn-, Pb-, Sb\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Ag-dominated deposits occurring distally. As one of the best examples, the Sn-, W- and base metal-mineralized Mole Granite, New South Wales, Australia, displays a prominent metal zonation from Sn (\u00b1B, Cu, Pb, Zn) in the granite interior, to W (\u00b1F, Be, Bi, As, Mo) at the granite margin, and base metal (As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Sb, Ag) in the surrounding sediments (Aud\u00e9tat et al., 2000).\nThe aforementioned cases enlighten us that the areas where a specific type mineralization have been discovered belonging to a magmatic hydrothermal system may have significant potential to find deposits with different styles of mineralization associated with the common magmatism. This model make it come true that a series of porphyry Sn-Cu-Mo deposits have been identified at deeper or adjacent sites of the discovered Ag-Pb-Zn deposits (e.g., Bianjiadayuan and Haobugao) at shallower parts in the Southern Great Xing\u2019an Range in China (Liu et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2017, 2018, 2019). As a consequence, it is likely that pegmatite-skarn-type W-Sn-Be polymetallic deposits occur at deeper sites beneath the Zhaxikang and Keyue distal Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag deposits (Fig. 18. This hypothesis is further supported by the concealed intrusion at depth of \u223c4\u00a0km beneath the Zhaxikang-Keyue area, which is inferred by the Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion, gravity and magnetic 3D inversion and deep seismic reflection data (Li, 2016; Liang, 2017). In addition to the Cuonadong Dome, a series of high-fractioned granite leucogranite complexes outcrop in the NHMB and some of them (Fig. 1b; e.g., Ranba, Xiaru and Lalong) are associated with pegmatite-skarn-type Sn-W-Be polymetallic mineralization (Wang et al., 2017a,b; Huang et al., 2019). So on the other hand, distal Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag veins controlled by faults within strata also need more attention around these leucogranite domes in the NHMB.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\n\n\n\nThree stages of hydrothermal veins were identified in the Keyue Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag polymetallic deposit, including Mn-Fe Carbonate-sulfide veins (I), quartz-sulfide-sulfosalt mineral veins (II) and quartz-calcite-stibnite veins (III).\n\n\nThe hydrothermal fluids at Keyue were initially sourced from magmatic water exsolved from the hidden causative intrusions of the same suite as the outcropping Cuonadong leucogranite rocks, with increasing input of meteoric water with time. Fluid phase separation was responsible for the deposition of Pb-Zn-Ag, whereas cooling and dilution due to mixing of magmatic fluids and meteoric water in triggered the stibnite precipitation.\n\n\nThe sulfur in the ore-forming fluids shows characteristics of mixture of magmatic and sedimentary sulfur. The ore-forming metals were mainly sourced from the concealed causative Himalayan leucogranite, which resulted from the decompression melting of metamorphic crystalline domains.\n\n\nKeyue represents the distal end-member Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag veins centered on the Cuonadong leucogranites. Pegmatite-skarn-type W-Sn-Be polymetallic deposits may occur at deeper sites beneath the Keyue-Zhaxikang area, whereas distal Pb-Zn-Sb-Ag veins controlled by faults within strata also need more attention around these leucogranite domes in the NHMB.\n\n\n\n\n","74":"","75":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are among the major elements in the Earth\u2019s crust with abundances of 5.76 and 0.1\u00a0wt%, respectively (Dill, 2010). Iron, Mn and Fe-Mn deposits have different origins and have formed throughout the period of formation of the Earth\u2019s crust in various geological settings (Dill, 2010; Maynard, 2010; Dill et al., 2013; Kuleshov, 2017). In oceanic basins, they occur in almost all geomorphological and tectonic environments and are formed through one or more of the following processes: (1) accretion of Fe-Mn colloids from the surrounding seawater at the bottom onto hard-rock substrates results in hydrogenetic deposits; (2) precipitation from upwelling hydrothermal fluids leaching sediments and oceanic crust results in stratabound hydrothermal deposits; and (3) precipitation from pore fluids in sediment below and seawater above produces mixed diagenetic\/hydrogenetic deposits (Hein, 2004; Hein et al., 2008; Bau et al., 2014). Iron and Mn deposits that form in oceanic basins are commonly found in the form of nodules, crusts, cements, mounds, and sediment-hosted stratabound beds and lenses. These deposits vary from nearly pure Fe oxide to nearly pure Mn oxide, with the full range of Fe and Mn concentrations between these two end members (Hein et al., 1997).\nManganese minerals in sedimentary environments may contain rare earths and trace elements in different concentrations due to ion substitutions or sorption on Mn oxides (Dill et al., 2011; Chakhmouradian and Wall, 2012; \u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2020). The distribution pattern of rare earth elements (REEs) and the concentration and elemental ratios of major and trace elements in Mn minerals have been extensively used to understand the genesis of Fe-Mn ores and to elucidate the geochemical conditions under which these minerals were formed (e.g., Hein et al., 1997, 2008; Jach and Dudek, 2005; Hein and Koschinsky, 2014; \u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2014; Hein et al., 2017; Konstantinova et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Vereshchagin et al., 2019; Garnit et al., 2020; \u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2020).\nThe Shamsabad Fe-Mn deposit is located 36\u00a0km southwest of the city of Arak in Markazi province in western Iran. The few studies that have been carried out so far on the Shamsabad deposit often include field and petrographic studies and the geochemistry of some major and trace elements in the ore. For example, Farhadi and Rastad (2002) assumed a sedimentary origin in which carbonate muds, Fe-Mn hydroxides and sulfides were deposited under dysaerobic conditions in the first phase of ore formation, followed by tectonic deformation leading to ore concentration in the hinge lines of the S- and Z-shaped folds in a later phase. In contrast, Heydari et al. (2014) believed hydrothermal mineralization in the Shamsabad deposit. In this paper, new geochemical data of major, trace and rare earth elements, as well as sulfur isotopes are combined with geological and mineralogical evidence to constrain the genesis of the Shamsabad Fe-Mn deposit and decipher the physicochemical conditions under which the ore was formed. As far as we know, this is the first analysis of manganese oxides (pyrolusite) using the method LA-ICP-MS.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Shamsabad deposit is located in the Malayer-Isfahan metallogenic belt of the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ). The SSZ, the most dynamic structural zone in Iran, is part of the Zagros orogen in the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic system. The Zagros orogenic belt can be lithologically and structurally divided into three parallel belts from south to north (Fig. 1\n), including the Zagros Fold and Thrust Belt, the SSZ and the Urumiyeh-Dokhtar magmatic arc (Alavi, 1994; Mohajjel et al., 2003; Agard et al., 2006; Ghasemi and Talbot, 2006; Sheikholeslami et al., 2008) (Fig. 1). The SSZ is a NW-SE trending belt of mainly metamorphic and igneous rocks located in the northeast extension of the Zagros orogen. The SSZ consists mainly of late Proterozoic\u2013Mesozoic metamorphic rocks, such as metacarbonates, schists, gneisses and amphibolites. They are overlain by Phanerozoic shallow-water sediments of a passive continental margin and are intruded by large gabbroic to granitic Mesozoic plutons (Mazhari et al., 2009).\nVarious rock units are exposed in the Shamsabad deposit area, ranging in age from Upper Triassic to Quaternary (Fig. 2\n). The oldest rock unit is Upper Triassic phyllites and quartz, feldspar, sericite, chlorite schists. On this unit, the Jurassic rocks, consisting of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites and quartz, feldspar, sericite, chlorite, biotite, muscovite schists, are gradually and conformably located. The Lower Cretaceous sediments unconformably deposited on Jurassic metamorphic rocks started with a basal rock unit consisting of gray conglomerate, sandstone and yellowish sandy dolomite (Kholghi, 2004). This rock unit is not shown on the geological map of the deposit area (Fig. 2). Lower Cretaceous strata occurring in the deposit area include: (1) yellowish, sandy dolomites; (2) gray, dark, thick-bedded, Orbitolina-bearing limestones; (3) a sequence of light, greenish-yellow calcareous shales and Orbitolina-bearing limestones; and (4) a sequence of marls and thick-bedded, Orbitolina-bearing limestones. Rock unit 2 hosts the mineralization in the Shamsabad deposit (Figs. 2 and 3\n). Medium-grained detrital quartz crystals are found in the limestones of this series. Most of the fossils found in the carbonate strata are agglutinated foraminifera (with an age of Aptian-Albian) as well as shallow marine fossils and algal traces. These finds indicate a shallow marine environment for the deposition of limestones (Jafarzadeh et al., 1996). Tertiary deposits, including conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and silty marl, cover the Lower Cretaceous deposits. Old and young alluvial fans and terraces and unconsolidated alluvium are the youngest sediments in the study area (Kholghi, 2004) (Fig. 2).\nThe rock unit that hosts the Shamsabad deposit forms the reverse limb of a northwest-southeast trending syncline. These strata strike northwest-southeast and dip northeast at 40\u00b0 to 80\u00b0. Double folds and s- and z-shaped structures are evident at all scales in the ore-bearing rock unit. Tectonic forces that have caused folding in the region have created two systems of extensional and compressional faults. Extension faults trend dominantly northeast-southwest. Compression faults run parallel to the axes of the synclines. In the Shamsabad area, a very weak metamorphic effect is observed in the Lower Cretaceous succession of sedimentary rocks (including the host rocks), which is the result of the Late Cretaceous Laramide orogenesis phase. The effects of this metamorphism are very mild and include poorly to well oriented textures in some rocks, elongation, ellipticity and flattening of minerals, formation of foliation and recrystallization (Kholghi, 2004). Because this metamorphism is so weak, its effects on the ore are insignificant, although it has affected mineralization. There is no evidence of magmatic activity in the Shamsabad area.\nStratabound Fe-Mn mineralization occurs in the Shamsabad deposit in gray, dark, thick-bedded, Orbitolina-bearing limestones of Lower Cretaceous age (Fig. 4\n). The geometry of the orebody is a large lens, 1200\u00a0m long and 250\u00a0m thick. It is often conformable and sharply separated from its lower and upper sedimentary beds. However, diffusive contacts are sometimes found in the footwall limestones. Several limestone lenses are contained within the orebody that conform to the ore. Based on the composition of the predominant gangue materials and ore grade, three carbonate, siliceous and high grade Fe-Mn ore types are considered for mineralization. Proven and probable ore reserves are estimated at 48.7 and 300 million tons, respectively. The average grade of the ore is estimated to be 40% Fe and 3% Mn (Jafarzadeh et al., 1996).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nDuring the field studies, forty-one samples were taken from the ore and host rocks. Care was taken in sampling to ensure that the samples represented as many features of the ore and host rock as possible. Fifteen thin sections and ten polished sections of the host rocks and ore were prepared and examined using a transmitted\/reflected polarizing microscope. To identify the mineral phases present in the ore, five samples were also analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The XRD patterns were recorded using a diffractometer (Model PW-1730 Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at the laboratory of Zamin Rizkavan Co. in Tehran, Iran.\nSix Fe-Mn samples with high Mn content were selected to investigate the geochemistry of the major and trace elements and rare earths (REE) of the ore. Samples were taken from various locations along the orebody to account for possible changes in the elemental content of the ore. Polished sections 1\u00a0in. in diameter were prepared from the samples and analyzed using the Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) method at the Magmatic and Ore-Forming Processes Research Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Toronto, Canada. An NWR-193 UC laser ablation system (10\u00a0Hz) connected to an Agilent 7900 quadrupole mass spectrometer was used. The NIST 610 glass was used as an external standard. The known Mn concentrations were used as an internal standard to quantify the sample compositions. The samples and standards were measured with a beam diameter of 25\u00a0\u03bcm and an energy density of 5\u00a0J\/cm2 on the sample surface. An Ar nebulizer and a He carrier gas were used at flow rates of 0.87 and 1.00\u00a0l\/min, respectively. The instrument was tuned to ThO\/Th\u223c <0.3%, Mass 21\/42Ca\u223c<0.3%, and 238U\/232Th of 1.0\u20131.1, using the NIST 610 glass. Quantification of the data was conducted using the software SILLS (Guillong et al., 2008), and the data were quantified based on the integrated peak areas. In calculating total major element oxides for quantification, it was assumed that all Mn and Fe in the samples were in the 4+ and 3+ oxidation states, respectively (i.e., Mn was considered as MnO2 and Fe as Fe2O3). The analysis points were selected on the mineral pyrolusite. Three points in each sample (18 points in total) were analyzed. Care was taken to correctly identify the indicated analysis points in the samples.\nFive galena samples were analyzed for sulfur isotopes. The samples were first crushed into small pieces with a steel mortar to release the galena grains. The pure galena crystals (>99%) were then picked up under a binocular microscope. The sulfur isotopic composition (\u03b434S) was determined at the G.G. Hatch Isotope Laboratory, University of Ottawa, Canada. The procedure used and the quality control protocol of the analysis followed the specifications in Marbouti et al. (2020). The analytical precision associated with each analysis is better than\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 \u2030. The isotopic composition of sulfur is reported in \u03b4 notation as per mil (\u2030) relative to the Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite (VCDT) standard.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrography and mineralogy\n\n4.1.1\nThe ore\nThe ore consists of hematite, iron hydroxides, and pyrolusite, with subordinate calcite quartz, galena and malachite. Hematite is much more abundant than other minerals. Hematite occurs as massive, veinlets and patches, and is generally brown to dark red in color. Iron hydroxides are found as colloform, massive and patches. Pyrolusite is observed as colloform, massive and veinlet aggregates (Pl1 in Fig. 9) as well as minute crystals in cavities within the ore (Fig. 5\na). This later occurrence indicates a second generation of pyrolusite (Pl2 in Fig. 9). Calcite with colloform aggregates fills the voids in the ore (Fig. 5a). Quartz is usually microcrystalline and occurs as minute crystals and very fine grains. Malachite is rarely found as small patches and coatings in the ore (Fig. 5b). Galena is rarely observed as coarse crystalline aggregates, especially in the northwestern part of the deposit (Fig. 5c). The ore sometimes exhibits fine lamination (Fig. 5d). XRD studies performed on the ore samples showed the presence of minerals hematite, goethite, pyrolusite and quartz.\nUnder the microscope, hematite occurs as medium to coarse-grained crystals, sometimes in platy form. Pyrolusite occurs as fine- to coarse-grained aggregates, sometimes consisting of prismatic needles. Pyrite crystals are seen in the goethite matrix (Fig. 6\na) and are pseudomorphically replaced by goethite and lepidocrocite (Fig. 6b). Simultaneously with the goethitization of the pyrite crystals in an oxidizing medium, Mn-containing solutions were also activated and caused the formation of coronadite under colloidal conditions (Fig. 6c). Coronadite occurs in the form of flakes and colloform aggregates. Coronadite gradually wears away in contact with goethite, which is evidence of the coeval nature of these two minerals (Fig. 6d). Todorokite is observed in discoidal and fibrous aggregates (Fig. 7\na). Coronadite is commonly found at the edges of todorokite (Fig. 7b). During the decomposition of pyrite grains into goethite and lepidocrocite, traces of brown iron ochre and rhodochrosite are formed (Fig. 7c). At the edges of the cavities, todorokite contains colloform coronadite, indicating the coexistence of these two minerals. Todorokite gradually transforms into goethite and lepidocrocite (Fig. 7d). Some cavities are probably filled with amorphous silica.\n\n\n4.1.2\nHost rocks\nDark gray, thick-bedded, Orbitolina-bearing limestones of Lower Cretaceous age are the host rocks to the Shamsabad deposit. These rocks are recrystallized and sometimes dolomitized so that sparitic calcite veinlets are clearly visible in them (Fig. 8\n\na, b and c). The Orbitolina-bearing limestones transition continuously upwards into an alternation of light, greenish-yellow calcareous shales and Orbitolina-bearing limestones. According to microscopic studies, the alteration of the wall rock is simple and includes silicification, recrystallization and partial dolomitization. The most important alteration is recrystallization, which leads to the formation of sparitic calcites at the expense of microcrystalline calcites.\n\n\n4.1.3\nShamsabad deposit paragenesis\nThe paragenetic sequence of host rocks, ore and gangue minerals in the Shamsabad deposit is shown in Fig. 9, as indicated by the field and microscopic studies. Originally, galena and pyrite formed under reducing conditions. Then, when the conditions became oxidizing, Fe and Mn oxides and hydroxide minerals such as hematite (Hm1), goethite (Gt1), pyrolusite (Pl1), todorokite and coronadite formed. Quartz was deposited along with sulfide and oxide minerals under both reducing and oxidizing conditions. Mineralization occurred mainly in the oxide phase. Weathering and supergene processes caused the alteration of oxide and sulfide minerals, resulting in the formation of minerals such as hematite (Hm2), goethite (Gt2), pyrolusite (Pl2), malachite, lepidocrocite, and rhodochrosite. Exogenous processes also caused the dissolution of carbonate rocks and the formation of secondary calcite in fractures and cavities within the ore.\n\n\n\n4.2\nConcentrations of major, trace and rare earth elements\nThe values of major, trace and rare earth elements (REEs) concentrations determined in six pyrolusite samples are given in Table 1\n. The lowest average values for analyzed elements (<50\u00a0ppm) belong to Ti, Mo, Y, As, P, Cd, Ni, Co, Cr, Zr and V. The highest average values (>1000\u00a0ppm) belong to Mn, Fe, Ca, Zn and Si. The average values for Al, Cu, Ba, Mg, Na, K and Pb are in the range of 50\u20131000\u00a0ppm. The mean values of Mn\/Fe ratio vary from 12 to 941. The mean values of Si\/Al ratio vary from 11.58 to 87.93, Co\/Ni from 0.33 to 0.89, and Co\/Zn from 0.002 to 0.004 in the studied samples. The Eu concentration is affected by an analytical artifact caused by spectral interference of Eu with BaO during ICP\u2013MS analysis (Greaves et al., 1989; Ehya, 2012; Ehya and Mazraei, 2017), so the interpretation of Eu data was not performed here. The mean values for the total concentration \u200b\u200bof REEs (\u03a3REE) ranged from 2.70 to 28.34\u00a0ppm. The mean values for the ratio of the total concentration of light rare earths (LREEs) to the total concentration of heavy rare earths (HREEs) (\u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE) vary from 6.21 to 20.25. The mean values for Ce\/Ce* vary from 0.18 to 1.23. The average values for LaN\/NdN ratio vary from 2.39 to 3.71, DyN\/YbN from 1.56 to 3.05, La\/Ce from 0.40 to 4.14, and Y\/Ho from 53.46 to 99.00 in the studied pyrolusite samples.\n\n\n4.3\nSulfur isotopic composition\nThe \u03b434S values for five galena samples from the Shamsabad deposit are presented in Table 2\n. The sulfur isotopic composition in the studied samples varies from 4.9\u2030 to 5.1%, with an average value of 5.0\u2030.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nGeochemistry of major and trace elements\nThe average Mn content in the pyrolusite samples varies between 57.35 and 62.04\u00a0wt% (Table 1). The stoichiometric composition of pyrolusite requires that this mineral contains 63.19\u00a0wt% Mn. A Mn value lower than that of the stoichiometric amount indicates that other elements have substituted the Mn in the pyrolusite lattice. The major substituents of Mn include Fe, Ca, Si, Zn and Pb (Table 1). The high concentrations of these elements in the structure of pyrolusite can be justified by the presence of their independent minerals (except Zn) in the ore of Shamsabad deposit. Astakhova et al. (2015) reported the chemical composition of some pyrolusite samples from the Central Basin of the Sea of Japan. Except for the high Fe concentrations in the samples from the Shamsabad deposit, the concentrations of most major and trace elements in the studied pyrolusite samples are close to the samples from the Sea of Japan, for which hydrothermal genesis is hypothesized (Astakhova et al., 2015).\nIron and Mn are fractionated during deposition from hydrothermal fluids, as Fe-bearing minerals are deposited first, followed by Mn-bearing phases. Instead, the reaction rate for Fe is much faster than that of Mn (Maynard, 2003), resulting in variable Mn\/Fe ratios in ores. The average Mn\/Fe ratios in the pyrolusite samples from the Shamsabad deposit vary from 12 to 941. In general, high (>10) and highly variable Mn\/Fe ratios are considered indicative of submarine hydrothermal deposits, while this ratio in hydrogenous ores is about one, which corresponds to the ratio in seawater (Nicholson et al., 1997; Jach and Dudek, 2005; Glasby, 2006; Rajabzadeh et al., 2017). The Mn\/Fe ratios suggest a submarine hydrothermal origin of the mineralization in the Shamsabad deposit. Moreover, hydrogenous and hydrothermal Fe-Mn deposits can be distinguished on the basis of Co\/Ni and Co\/Zn ratios in the ores. The Co\/Ni\u00a0<\u00a01 indicates a sedimentary origin, while Co\/Ni\u00a0>\u00a01 indicates a deep marine environment (\u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2014; Ko\u00e7ak, 2020). Chemical analyses of Mn- and Fe-rich oxide crusts from active spreading centers and seamounts in the Pacific and Atlantic revealed that the Co\/Zn values of hydrothermal crusts are very low, averaging 0.15, while those of hydrogenous crusts and nodules average 2.5 (Toth, 1980). The average Co\/Ni ratios in the ore samples studied range from 0.33 to 0.89, while the average Co\/Zn ratios range from 0.002 to 0.004. Therefore, the Co\/Zn ratios indicate a hydrothermal source for the Shamsabad deposit, while the Co\/Ni ratios show that sedimentary processes played an important role in the formation of the ore.\nThe trace elements As, Ba, Cu, Li, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sr, V and Zn are generally enriched in Fe-Mn oxide deposits precipitated from hydrothermal fluids (Nicholson et al., 1997; Hein et al., 2008). All samples studied show enrichment of As, Ba, Cu, Pb and Zn comparable to hydrothermal deposits (Table 1). The average Co concentrations in the Shamsabad ores vary from 2.72 to 6.28\u00a0ppm. These low Co concentrations indicate minimal contribution of hydrogenous processes in ore formation (Hein et al., 2008). Titanium is an immobile element in hydrothermal solutions and can be used as an indicator of the amount of detrital material mixed with the ore. Low average Ti concentrations (1.16\u201333.80\u00a0ppm) in the studied ores confirm their non-detrital origin, which in turn shows that the ore was most likely deposited from hydrothermal solutions (Arrhenius and Tsai, 1981).\nTernary Mn-Fe-(Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Co\u00a0+\u00a0Cu)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 (Crerar et al., 1982) and binary (Co\/Zn)-(Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Co\u00a0+\u00a0Cu) (Toth, 1980) and (Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Co)-(As\u00a0+\u00a0Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Mo\u00a0+\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0V\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) (Nicholson, 1992) diagrams are commonly used to discriminate between hydrogenous, hydrothermal and diagenetic Mn deposits (Fig. 10\na, b and c). The pyrolusite samples from the Shamsabad deposit fall into the hydrothermal and diagenetic domains in the ternary Fe-Mn-(Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Co\u00a0+\u00a0Cu)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 diagram (Fig. 10a). The studied samples also fall within the hydrothermal field of the binary (Co\/Zn)-(Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Co\u00a0+\u00a0Cu) and (Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Co)-(As\u00a0+\u00a0Cu\u00a0+\u00a0Mo\u00a0+\u00a0Pb\u00a0+\u00a0V\u00a0+\u00a0Zn) diagrams (Fig. 10b and c). According to the ternary Ni-Cu-Co diagram (Nicholson, 1992), deposits formed by hydrothermal and volcanic processes have the highest Cu contents compared to sedimentary deposits and Mn nodules (Nicholson et al., 1997). In the ternary Ni-Cu-Co diagram (Fig. 11\na), most of the samples studied fall in the hydrothermal range, with a few in the volcanogenic field. The Si versus Al diagram is used as a simple tool to identify hydrothermal, hydrogenous-detrital, and detrital-diagenetic deposits (Choi and Hariya, 1992). Since silica in Fe and Mn deposits is mainly provided by submarine hydrothermal processes, the amount of silica in corresponding deposits is relatively high. However, clay minerals are another source of silica in Mn deposits (Baioumy et al., 2013). Aluminum is supplied dominantly by the detrital grains of clay minerals in continental sediments (Crerar et al., 1982). Nevertheless, a sudden increase in the Si\/Al ratio in Cretaceous Mn ores is attributed to the radiation of diatoms (Maynard, 2010). Due to the low correlation coefficient between Si and Al (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.07) in the studied samples from the Shamsabad deposit, detrital material cannot be considered as a source of silica. The average Si\/Al ratios in the samples vary from 11.58 to 87.93, and these high values, together with the Si versus Al diagram, indicate that the Shamsabad ores are of hydrothermal origin (Fig. 11b) (Choi and Hariya, 1992). However, this conclusion is not conclusive as the Si could be supplied by diatoms rather than hydrothermal solutions.\n\n\n5.2\nGeochemistry of REEs\nThe REE signatures in hydrothermal and hydrogenous Fe-Mn deposits differ significantly. Therefore, they can provide fundamental and useful information on the genetic processes responsible for the formation of submarine Fe-Mn deposits (Hein et al., 1997). The REE concentrations commonly differ between hydrogenous and hydrothermal Fe-Mn deposits. Hydrothermal deposits have relatively low REE concentration values, while hydrogenous deposits are significantly enriched in REEs (\u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2014; Zarasvandi et al., 2016). Rapid deposition of hydrothermal Fe-Mn ores limits their REE enrichment (Schmidt et al., 2014). In contrast, Mn nodules and crusts grow very slowly while extensively contacting seawater and pore fluids to absorb trace metals (Fitzgerald and Gillis, 2006; \u00d6ks\u00fcz, 2011; Josso et al., 2017). Hydrothermal Fe-Mn oxides show large variations in \u03a3REE values \u200b\u200b(Mills et al., 2001). The average \u03a3REE values \u200b\u200bin the studied samples vary from 2.70 to 28.34\u00a0ppm. Therefore, the low \u03a3REE values \u200b\u200b (<100\u00a0ppm) (Rajabzadeh et al., 2017) and their high variability \u200b\u200bindicate that the Shamsabad deposit is of hydrothermal origin. The \u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE ratio can be used as an indicator of primary REE enrichment during Mn oxidation processes (Xie et al., 2006; \u00d6ks\u00fcz, 2011), so if LREE\u00a0>\u00a0HREE mineralization can be associated with hydrothermal solutions (Fitzgerald and Gillis, 2006; \u00d6ks\u00fcz, 2011; \u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2014). HREE depletion in hydrothermal deposits is likely related to the weak ability of these elements to bind to chloride complexes (Josso et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020). The average \u03a3LREE\/\u03a3HREE ratios in the studied ore samples from Shamsabad deposit vary from 6.21 to 20.25. Moreover, the chondrite-normalized REE patterns clearly show the enrichment of LREE compared to HREE in the samples (Fig. 12\n). So, it is very likely that hydrothermal fluids are responsible for the mineralization in Shamsabad deposit.\nUnder the Eh and pH conditions of seawater, Ce exists mainly as Ce4+, its solubility is very low, and it is therefore not easy to remain dissolved in seawater. Cerium often precipitates on the surface of Mn oxides (Takahashi et al., 2007), resulting in severe Ce depletion in seawater. Hence, a positive Ce anomaly in Fe-Mn oxide deposits is considered typical of hydrogenetic deposition. Due to differences in kinetics between different Fe-Mn deposits and irreversible Ce uptake from seawater, Ce will be most enriched in hydrogenetic deposits, less enriched in diagenetic deposits, and even less enriched in hydrothermal deposits (Jach and Dudek, 2005; Josso et al., 2017). The negative Ce anomalies (except for one sample) in the tested samples also confirm that hydrothermal fluids were responsible for the mineralization in the Shamsabad deposit.\nHydrothermal Mn crusts have a La\/Ce ratio relatively similar to that of seawater (\u223c2.8), whereas hydrogenous Fe-Mn crusts have lower values (\u223c0.25) (Nath et al., 1997; \u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2014). The average values of La\/Ce ratio in the studied samples vary from 0.40 to 4.14, indicating that the Shamsabad deposit has a hydrothermal origin. The ratios of LaN\/NdN and DyN\/YbN in hydrothermal solutions range from 3 to 7.4 and 0.6 to 2.1, respectively, while in Mn oxide crusts they range from 2.7 to 4.3 and 0.4 to 1.2, respectively (Fitzgerald and Gillis, 2006; \u00d6ks\u00fcz, 2011; \u015ea\u015fmaz et al., 2014. These ratios for hydrogenous deposits range from 0.9 to 1.5 and 0.3 to 1.91, respectively (Elderfield et al., 1981). The average values for the ratios of LaN\/NdN and DyN\/YbN in the studied samples vary from 2.39 to 3.71 and from 1.56 to 3.05, respectively, again suggesting that the source of the ore can be considered as hydrothermal.\nThe geochemical behavior of Y is similar to that of REEs, especially Ho (Jochum et al., 1986). The Y\/Ho ratio in igneous rocks and epiclastic sediments is similar to the molar ratio in chondrites (52; Bao et al., 2008). The Y\/Ho ratio in hydrothermal fluids is often determined by non-chondritic values and varies between 51 and 160 in hydrothermal vents associated with mid-oceanic-back arc basins (Bao et al., 2008; Ehya, 2012). The average values \u200b\u200bof Y\/Ho ratio in the Shamsabad samples range from 53.46 to 99.00, which is within the range of submarine hydrothermal vents.\nThe binary diagrams based on the concentration of Ce (Ce, Ce\/Ce*), Y, Ho, Nd and Zr are also used as useful tools to investigate the origin of Mn oxides (e.g. Bau et al., 2014; Josso et al., 2017). The Shamsabad samples are plotted in these discrimination diagrams with typical examples of diagenetic, hydrogenetic and hydrothermal Fe-Mn deposits (Fig. 13\n). In both the Ce\/Ce* versus Nd and Ce versus (Co\u00a0+\u00a0Ni\u00a0+\u00a0Cu)\/1000 diagrams (Fig. 13a and b), the Shamsabad samples fall within the ranges represented by the hydrothermal samples of Josso et al. (2017) and Zeng et al. (2012). In the plots Ce versus Zr and (Ce\/Ce*)SN versus (Y\/Ho)SN (Bau et al., 2014) (the suffix \u201cSN\u201d signifies normalization to Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS; McLennan, 1989)), the Shamsabad samples are either in or near the hydrothermal fields (Fig. 13c and d). Therefore, these diagrams also show that the Shamsabad deposit has a hydrothermal origin.\n\n\n5.3\nSource of sulfur\nThe study of sulfur isotopes to determine the origin and formation conditions of sulfide deposits is of particular importance (Hoefs, 2009). The isotopic composition of sulfur is a function of the isotopic composition of the source fluid, which changes over time with changes in the physicochemical conditions of the environment (temperature, pH, and oxygen fugacity; Ohmoto and Goldhaber, 1997). Sulfur in the natural environments has two main sources: magma and seawater. Sulfur derived from the Earth\u0301s mantle (magmatic sulfur) has a \u03b434S value of about 0\u2030 (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979; Hoefs, 2009). The \u03b434S values in galena samples from the Shamsabad deposit vary between 4.9 and 1.5\u2030 (mean 5.0\u2030), which is slightly more positive than that of magmatic-origin sulfur. The \u03b434S values of seawater have changed greatly since the Precambrian, so that the maximum value of\u00a0+\u00a035\u2030 was for the Precambrian-Cambrian and the minimum value of\u00a0+\u00a011\u2030 was for the Permian-Triassic (Claypool et al., 1980). Paytan et al. (2004) considered \u03b434S values from 15.3 to 20.2\u2030 (mean 17.7\u2030) for Lower Cretaceous seawater. Since the age of the host rocks of Shamsabad deposit is from Lower Cretaceous, the isotopic composition of the studied samples can be compared with that of Lower Cretaceous seawater. The average \u03b434S value of the galena samples from the Shamsabad deposit (5.0\u2030) is considerably lower than the average value of the Lower Cretaceous seawater. The reduction of sulfate in seawater to sulfide could be due to either bacterial or thermochemical sulfate reduction. Sulfides produced through bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) are enriched in 32S compared to the source and generally have a wide range of \u03b434S values (Seal, 2006). The narrow range for \u03b434S in the galena samples reveals that they were not produced by BSR. The production of sulfide by thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) requires a sulfate reaction with organic material at relatively high temperatures. TSR can produce reduced sulfur with the same isotopic ratio as the sulfate source or up to 15\u2030 lighter, depending on the temperature and amount of reduced sulfate (Ehya et al., 2010). However, the lack of abundant organic material in limestone host rocks also makes TSR activity unlikely. Alternatively, the source of sulfur in the Shamsabad deposit appears to be magmatic, partially mixed with sulfate from seawater. On the other hand, no magmatic activities are observed in the study area. Since there are many intrusive bodies in the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone, it is possible that the mineralizing solutions derived the sulfur from a subsurface pluton (see below).\n\n\n5.4\nA genetic model for the Shamsabad deposit\nThis study provides important data by which the origin of the Shamsabad deposit can be determined. Based on these data, it can be said that the ores were precipitated from submarine hydrothermal fluids. The evidence supporting this conclusion is presented in Table 3\n. In addition to the features listed there, colloform textures and lamination of the ore, as well as the presence of conformable limestone lenses within the ore are evidence of hydrothermal origin, and synsedimentary deposition in a marine environment.\n\nFig. 14\n shows the proposed hydrothermal-sedimentary genetic model for the Shamsabad deposit. This model shows the conditions suitable for accumulation of Fe-Mn deposits in the sedimentary successions without volcanic products but with signs of hydrothermal activity (Brusnitsyn, 2013; Kuleshov, 2017). Tectonic forces and emerging fault systems caused subsidence and spreading of seawater in the study area. Carbonate sediments with shale intercalations were deposited in a shallow marine environment during the Lower Cretaceous. Hydrothermal solutions containing Fe, Mn, silica, Ca and other trace elements entered the sedimentary basin contemporaneously with sedimentation. The main concern of the considered model is the source(s) of the ore-forming solutions, so two scenarios can be considered (Brusnitsyn, 2013). First, hydrothermal fluids could escape from the bedrock into the sedimentary basin through possible deep-seated faults. A fault system could serve as a pathway for hydrothermal solutions mobilized during tectono-magmatic evolution of the region. Second, ore-bearing fluids could result from the movement of pore water within the actual buried sedimentary strata, as well as from the dehydration of clay minerals. Such solutions have long been considered ore-forming fluids to justify the formation of some base and trace metal deposits (Brusnitsyn, 2013 and references therein). Although fluids from both sources may have played a role in ore formation at the Shamsabad deposit, the fact that the isotopic composition of sulfur in the galena samples is close to that of magmatic sulfur may indicate that the ore-forming solutions originated mainly from deep fluids in basement rocks, most of which have interacted with or are partly derived from a buried magmatic body (Fig. 14).\nIntrusion of metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids into the sedimentary basin and mixing with seawater changed the Eh-pH conditions (Brusnitsyn, 2013; Brusnitsyn and Zhukov, 2018) and consequently led to the deposition of ore materials. As for pH, Fe is precipitated under acidic conditions, while Mn is precipitated in basic environments (e.g., Maynard, 2003). Iron compounds thus accumulate near hydrothermal vents (pH\u00a0<\u00a07), while Mn-bearing sediments are located away from vents where hydrothermal fluids are highly diluted by seawater (pH\u00a0>\u00a07). The fact that Fe and Mn minerals coexist in the Shamsabad deposit indicates that the mixing of the hydrothermal solution with seawater progressed relatively rapidly and within a restricted area (Brusnitsyn, 2013). On the other hand, the fact that the sulfur isotopic composition of galena is closer to that of magmatic sulfur than to that of seawater reveals that the ore-forming solutions did not even mix greatly with seawater. This could explain the precipitation of the ore in close proximity to the hydrothermal vent. Moreover, the presence of a negative Ce anomaly in the REE pattern of the pyrolusites could be a possible indicator that Mn was initially precipitated dominantly as oxides and hydroxides with Mn2+ and\/or Mn3+ oxidation states (Brusnitsyn, 2013). This implies that the Eh conditions during the initial deposition of the ore were not strictly oxic but suboxic, justifying the coexistence of minor sulfides (pyrite and galena) with the prevailing oxi-hydroxides of the Fe-Mn ore minerals. Oxidation of Mn to Mn4+ (i.e. pyrolusite) could occur in the later stages of diagenesis and supergenesis. Negative Ce anomalies are also reported in Mn deposits from the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) and interpreted as evidence of relatively rapid precipitation under hydrothermal conditions (Barriga, 1990).\nFerromanganese (Fe-Mn) ores are spatially related to Pb\u2013Zn deposits, as the latter are known to occur in the carbonate strata of areas adjacent to Fe-Mn deposits (e.g., Atasui region in central Kazakhstan and the Parnok deposit, Russia, Brusnitsyn, 2013). It seems that Fe-Mn and Pb\u2013Zn ores are products of related hydrothermal systems, but differences in the geochemical affinity of the elements result in Fe-Mn ores being concentrated in oxidizing geochemical barriers, while those of Pb and Zn in reducing ones (Brusnitsyn, 2013). This spatial association also applies to the Shamsabad deposit, so that the Emarat, Tekyeh and Muchan Zn-Pb deposits (Ehya et al., 2010) near Shamsabad occur in the same stratigraphic horizon in the Lower Cretaceous carbonate rocks.\n\n\n5.5\nAttribution within the tectono-metallogenetic phases of Mn mineralization in the Middle East\n\nDill et al. (2013), through a mineralogical analysis of individual Mn deposits along the western margin of the Arabian Plate (which includes the states of Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Cyprus and Turkey), in conjunction with data on plate tectonic processes over the past 500 million years, identified six tectono-metallogenetic phases for Mn mineralization in the Middle East, including (1) Late Precambrian to Early Cambrian along the Wadi Araba, Timna and Saramuj (Jordan-Valley-Rift); (2) Early Cambrian to Late Ordovician along the Wadi Araba, Timna and Saramuj; (3) Late Devonian to Late Carboniferous at Um Bogma and Abu Zenima, Egypt; (4) Middle Permian to Early Jurassic at the intersection of the Dead Sea Jordan Valley Rift and the Palmyra Trough; (5) Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic in Troodos, Cyprus, and the Gulf of Suez; and (6) Late Cenozoic to Quaternary. Manganese mineralization in the Middle East and East Africa is closely related, temporally and spatially, to the evolution of the triple junctions (i.e., the opening of the Paleo- and Neotethys oceans) that led to the breakup of the crust in northern Gondwana, and the associated linear fault zones that penetrated deep into the upper mantle, allowing alkaline magmas to use these plate boundaries as conduits for their ascent (Dill et al., 2013). On the other hand, Iranian Mn deposits formed during the following time periods: (1) Late Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian; (2) Jurassic; (3) Upper Cretaceous; and (4) Eocene-Miocene. The formation and distribution of Mn deposits in Iran are also attributed to the divergent and convergent events related to the development of Proto-, Paleo-, and Neo-Tethyan oceans (Maghfouri et al., 2019). Since Iran is a part of the Middle East, it is not surprising that the time periods and tectonic processes of Mn mineralization in Iran and the Middle East overlap. Neither in Iran nor in the Middle East is the Lower Cretaceous a metallogenic epoch for Mn. However, since Fe-Mn ore formation in the Shamsabad deposit occurred as synsedimentary in the Lower Cretaceous, the Lower Cretaceous must be considered a metallogenic epoch for Mn in Iran and the Middle East, even if it is of minor importance.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe Fe-Mn mineralization of Shamsabad is a stratabound deposit that conformably occurs in Lower Cretaceous limestones. Clear evidence such as colloform textures and lamination of the ore coupled with the presence of conformable limestone lenses within the ore supports a sedimentary-hydrothermal origin of the deposit. In addition to the above facts, the geochemistry of major, trace and rare earth elements (REEs), as well as sulfur isotopes reveal a submarine hydrothermal origin of the Shamsabad deposit. Considering the data provided in this study, a sedimentary-hydrothermal ore formation model is concluded for the deposit. According to this model, the hydrothermal fluids vented to the sedimentary basin dominantly through deep-seated faults in the basement rocks, and probably to a lesser extent through the expulsion of pore water in the proper buried sedimentary strata. The hydrothermal system may have been activated by a rejuvenation of tectonic and magmatic processes in the basement of the sedimentary sequence. Hydrothermal fluids leached the rocks with which they were in contact and were enriched in ore-forming materials. The exhaled metal-bearing hydrothermal solutions mixed with seawater at the seafloor, leading to a change in the Eh-pH conditions of the environment and eventually to the deposition of the ore. The coexistence of Fe-Mn minerals in the ore and the sulfur isotopic composition of galena reveal that mixing of hydrothermal solutions with seawater occurred rapidly, but not in large amounts, under conditions of pH\u00a0<\u00a07. The negative Ce anomaly in pyrolusite and the coexistence of minor sulfides with Fe-Mn oxihydroxide ore minerals indicate that Eh conditions were suboxic during ore deposition.\n\n","76":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nInternationally, tungsten is known as an important mineral resource (Gulley et al., 2018). Owing to its high hardness, high melting point, good conductivity, and stable chemical properties, tungsten is widely used in the chemical industry and in metallurgy, electronics, machinery, aerospace, and the national defense science and technology sectors where it is known as \u201cindustrial teeth\u201d (Fortier et al., 2018; Calvo et al., 2019). Previous studies have shown that abundant W-Sn deposits distributed in Southern China and the Variscan orogenic belt in Europe are genetically related to highly fractionated reduced granites (Blevin, 2004; Fogliata et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2018). These fractionated granites usually have high W and Sn contents that are several to dozens of times higher than the Clark value (Neiva, 1984; Poldervaart, 1955; Wu et al., 2017). Unlike W-Sn, Cu-Mo mineralization, in general, is formed in low differentiated oxidized magmatic systems (Wang et al., 2018a). However, coexisting W and Mo mineralization in a magmatic system is still poorly understood, even though models linking plutonic and volcanic rock suites to Sn\u2013W\u2013Mo mineralization have been recognized by Cheng et al. (2018). Therefore, determining the relationship between \u201cfertile\u201d and \u201cbarren\u201d magmatic rocks associated with W-Mo mineralization in a single magmatic system can aid in the assessments of the potential of regional-scale tungsten mineralization and guide its exploration. Furthermore, most scholars have accepted that S-type granite is closely related to tungsten mineralization (Huang and Jiang, 2014; Mao et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2018). However, tungsten mineralization formed in I-type granites has also been reported (e.g., Solomon, 1981; Vernon et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2012), but little is known about the genesis of tungsten deposits hosted in I-type granites. The Tibetan Plateau is the widest orogenic plateau in the world and has undergone large-scale crustal thickening (Xu et al., 2020). However, the potential for tungsten mineralization in this region has rarely been studied. There are very large quantities of Mesozoic to Cenozoic highly fractionated granitoids in the Gangdese and Nyainqentanglha belt of the Lhasa terrane, which make it an ideal laboratory for studying evolved felsic magma systems with W-Mo mineralization.\nThe Gangdese-Nyainqentanglha belt is currently the largest copper polymetallic metallogenic belt in China. Many porphyry Cu\u2013Mo and skarn Pb-Zn deposits here are closely related to granitic rocks (Rui et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2015a, 2015b; Hou et al., 2015a, 2015b; Gao et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021). The formation of porphyry Cu\u2013Mo deposits (e.g., Qulong, Jiama, Zhunuo, Tinggong, and Chongjiang) in the southern Lhasa terrane is mainly related to oxidized intermediate and felsic magmas (Rui et al., 2003; Hou and Cook, 2009; Hou et al., 2015a, 2015b; Zheng et al., 2015a, 2015b; Yang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a; Chen et al., 2020). There are also skarn Pb-Zn deposits in the central Lhasa terrane, such as Yaguila, Bangbule, Chagele, and Gaerqiong, which are mainly related to S-type felsic magmas (Gao et al., 2011a, 2011b, 2020, 2021). Recently, abundant tungsten-bearing polymetallic deposits were discovered in the Lhasa terrane, including the Hahaigang W-Mo deposit (Li et al., 2014), the Nuri W-Mo-Cu deposit (Zhang et al. 2012; Wang et al., 2018c), the Tuolangla W-Mo deposit (Liu, 2018), and the Jiagang (Xu et al., 2020) and Jiaoxi W-(Mo) deposits (Wang et al., 2018b; 2020). These findings show that the Lhasa terrane is favorable to research tungsten mineralization. There have been several studies on the mineralization style, age, tectonic setting, and petrogenesis of W-dominated deposits (Xu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018b; 2020). Nevertheless, the genetic relationships between mineralization and the magma evolution of these W-dominated deposits remain poorly understood, hindering the further understanding of the genesis and metallogenic regularity of regional tungsten mineralization.\nThe Hahaigang W-Mo polymetallic deposit is located in the central Lhasa terrane, in the eastern section of the Nyainqentanglha tectonic magmatic metallogenic belt. It is the first tungsten-dominated polymetallic deposit discovered in the belt (Li et al., 2014). A series of studies have been carried out on the geological characteristics and geochronology of the deposit (Qin et al., 2013; Li et al; 2014; Sun et al., 2017). The Re-Os dating of molybdenite veins in the W-Mo bearing granites is 63.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma, indicating that the deposit formed during the collision of the Indian and Asian plates (Li et al., 2014). Owing to a lack of studies on the genesis of ore-related magmatic rocks, the magmatic evolution sequence of the deposit is not clear, and an understanding of its dynamic metallogenic background is still lacking. To investigate the petrogenesis of the magmatic rocks associated with W\u2013Mo mineralization in the Hahaigang W-Mo deposit, in this study, zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock geochemistry, and Hf-Pb isotopic data of ore-related granodiorite and monzogranite in the deposit were analyzed. Meanwhile, metal sulfide S-Pb isotopic compositions are also reported to constrain the source of the ore-forming materials. The main aims of this study are to describe the relationship between magmatism and W-Mo polymetallic mineralization and provide insights into the relationship between W and Mo ore-related magmas in a highly evolved felsic magma system. These results may improve estimations of the tungsten metallogenic potential of granitoids in the Lhasa terrane and provide more information on regional metallogenesis and exploration vectors.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Tibetan Plateau, from north to south, consists of the Songpan\u2013Ganze, Qiangtang, Lhasa, and Himalaya terranes (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhu et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2012; Hou et al., 2015a). The Lhasa terrane, which extends to>1500\u00a0km, lies between the Bangong\u2013Nujiang and the Yarlung\u2013Tsangpo suture belt. It experienced the long-lasting subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere and the collision of the Indian-Asian continent, and, therefore, it is a typical complex continental magmatic arc (Fig. 1\n). The Lhasa terrane can be further subdivided into the northern (NLS), central (CLS), and southern (SLS) Lhasa subterranes (Zhu et al., 2011). According to zircon Hf isotope mapping, the NLS and SLS mainly consist of juvenile crust and the CLS consists of a basement of Proterozoic and Archean rocks overlain by widespread Permian\u2013Carboniferous metasedimentary rocks that include continental arc volcanic rocks and abundant glaciomarine diamictites (Pan et al., 2004; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2015a, 2015b). In the Lhasa terrane, there are abundant Mesozoic\u2013Cenozoic magmatic activities that have been documented, and these record the early subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere (220\u2013100\u00a0Ma), the subduction of the NeoTethyan oceanic ridge (100\u201380\u00a0Ma), the late subduction of the remnant Neo-Tethyan lithosphere (80\u201365\u00a0Ma), the collision of India and Asia (65\u201340\u00a0Ma), and the post-collisional stage (40\u20138\u00a0Ma) (Mo et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021). Several metallogenic events related to these magmatic activities have been identified in the CLS and SLS (Hou and Cook, 2009; Hou et al., 2015a, b). The Xiongcun and Luerma porphyry Cu\u2013Au deposits are associated with subduction-related Late Triassic\u2013Jurassic (223\u2013145\u00a0Ma) volcanic rocks and granitoids (Tang et al., 2015; Tafti et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2020). Five Pb-Zn ore concentrated areas (Yaguila-Mengya\u2019a, Xingaguo-Leqingla, Narusondo-Slondou, Chagele-Longgen, and Bangbule) are identified in the CLS, which are related to syn-collisional Paleocene (65\u201355\u00a0Ma) volcanic rocks and granitoid intrusions (Fig. 1; Gao et al., 2011a, b; Zhao et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a; Gao et al., 2020; 2021). More than ten large porphyry Cu (Mo) deposits (e.g., Qulong, Jiama, Chongjiang, and Zhunuo) are related to post-collisional high-K calc-alkaline intrusions in the SLS (Rui et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2009, 2013, 2015a, b; Zheng et al., 2015a; Yang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a).\nRecently, collision-related W-dominated polymetallic deposits have been discovered in the CLS and SLS (Zhang et al. 2012; Li et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018c; Liu, 2018; Wang et al., 2018b; 2020). The Hahaigang deposit in the CLS has a mineralization age of 63.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma, which reveals that the deposit formed during the syn-collisional environment that occurred during the collision of the Indian and Asian plates (Li et al., 2014). The Jiaoxi and Jiagang W deposit with a mineralized age of 18\u201311\u00a0Ma is related to the post-collisional granite in the CLS (Wang et al., 2018b, 2020; Xu et al., 2020). In the SLS, the skarn Nuri and Tuolangla deposits with mineralization ages from 25 to 23\u00a0Ma have been reported. They have high molybdenite Re contents (up to 665\u00a0ppm) and \u03b5Hf(t) values (+3.6- +8.7) in the ore-related magma, which indicates that the mantle material played a more crucial role in the skarn W-bearing mineralization (Zhang et al. 2012; Wang et al., 2018c; Liu, 2018).\n\n\n3\nGeology of the Hahaigang deposit\nExposed strata in the Hahaigang deposit are mainly of the Permian Pangna Group and Quaternary sediments (Fig. 2\n). The Pangna Group rocks are composed of slate, quartz sandstone, meta-quartz sandstone, chloritized sandstone, and silicified sandstone (Fig. 2). The main faults are exposed in the Dalong fault zone, controlling the distribution of skarn and orebodies (Li et al., 2014). The Dalong fault zone has an outcrop length of about 5\u00a0km and its surface width varies from 20\u00a0m to 100\u00a0m, with a dip angle of about 60\u00b0. A NE trending garnet diopside skarn is intermittently distributed along the fault zone. Three main magmatic rocks are exposed at the south of the fault zone (Fig. 2): (1) Monzogranite, occurring as small stocks and dykes, is mainly distributed in the middle and northeastern mining area near the W-dominated (No.3) and W-Mo-dominated (No.4) orebodies (Fig. 2a-b). W-Mo mineralization is developed in the contact area of the rocks and skarn, indicating that the monzogranite is closely related to the W-Mo mineralization. The rocks are light gray-white color, with fine-grained and porphyritic-like texture, with a diameter from 0.1 to 1\u00a0mm. The primary minerals are plagioclase (40\u00a0vol%), K-feldspar (35\u201340\u00a0vol%), quartz (20\u201325\u00a0vol%), and muscovite (1\u20133\u00a0vol%) (Fig. 3\na-c). (2) Two generations of granodiorite have been identified in the study area (Fig. 2). The first generation of granodiorite formed at 194.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0Ma, which is earlier than the mineralization age. The ore-related Paleocene granodiorite is mainly distributed in the southwest study area as stock or dykes near the W-Mo and Mo-dominated No.3 and No.4 orebodies (Fig. 2). Quartz-molybdenite veins are developed in the granodiorite, indicating that the Mo mineralization may be related to granodiorite. The rocks are gray in color and have a massive structure with a medium- to coarse-grained granitic texture, with a diameter from 2 to 8\u00a0mm. The primary minerals are plagioclase (50\u201355\u00a0vol%), K-feldspar (15\u00a0vol%), quartz (20\u201325\u00a0vol%), and biotite (20\u201330\u00a0vol%) (Fig. 3d-f), with a small number of accessory minerals, zircon, and apatite.\nThe estimated metal reserves in the Hahaigang Mo-W deposit includes 44,173 tons of WO3, 59,734 tons of Mo, and 195,064 tons of combined Cu\u2013Pb\u2013Zn, at an average grade of 0.09% WO3, 0.122% Mo, 0.77% Cu, 0.49% Pb, and 4.68% Zn. The main mineralization in the Hahaigang deposit hosted in skarn shows a W\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Mo(W)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization zone along the Dalong fault zones from NE to SW. Five main skarn ore bodies have been identified by trenching and drilling. They are divided into W-Mo dominated (No.4 and 5), W-dominated (No.3), and Pb-Zn-Cu dominated orebodies (No.1 and 2) (Fig. 2). The No. 4 and 5\u00a0W\u2013Mo orebodies display thick veins in the northwestern study area, with occasional stone intercalations of 1\u20132\u00a0m. The orebody group is 800\u00a0m long horizontally and extends up to 500\u00a0m deep at a dip of 58\u201372\u00b0 to 300\u2013327\u00b0. The thickness of No. 4 and 5\u00a0W\u2013Mo orebodies ranges from 1 to 78\u00a0m with an average of 26.4\u00a0m. The average WO3 and Mo grades are 0.089% and 0.125%, respectively. The No.3 orebody is a skarn-type W-Mo orebody, with a length of 560\u2013660\u00a0m and an elevation of 3736\u20134350\u00a0m. The orebody has a dip of 330\u00b0 and a dip angle of 44\u00b0\u201366\u00b0. The thickness of the orebody ranges from 1 to 18\u00a0m, the average Mo grade is 0.119%, and the average WO3 grade is 0.093%. The No.1 and 2 orebodies are located in the southeastern studied area (Fig. 2). The length of No.2 along the strike is 200\u2013240\u00a0m, its extension is 155\u2013200\u00a0m, and the thickness is 1\u201314\u00a0m with an average Zn grade of 4.73% and average Cu grade of 0.92%. The ores show stock-veins (Fig. 4\na), banded structure (Fig. 4b-c), and disseminated structures, and anhedral, subhedral, and metasomatic dissolution textures (Fig. 4d-n). They consist mainly of scheelite, molybdenite, galena, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, with minor arsenopyrite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, and pyrite (Figs. 4-5\n).\nThe five stages of the paragenetic sequence of minerals in the Hahaigang deposit are shown in Fig. 6\n. Garnet and pyroxene are precipitated in the prograde skarn stage (stage I) (Fig. 5a-e and 6). Garnet is usually green and light red with distinct oscillatory zoning and accounts for 15\u201330% of the total skarn minerals (Fig. 5a-e). Pyroxene is present in locally developed assemblages with garnet (Fig. 5a-e). Stage II is identified by the occurrence of hydrous epidote, actinolite, and chlorite (Fig. 5g-n and 6), with few disseminated amounts of scheelite, magnetite, and molybdenite (Fig. 5n). Epidote, actinolite, and chlorite replace both garnet and pyroxene in this stage (Fig. 5g\u2013h). The oxide stage (stage III) appears as quartz-magnetite-molybdenite veins, which are typical for the formation of well-developed Mo-W orebodies that crosscut the skarn (Fig. 4b-c). Some chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and small amounts of molybdenite occur in the early sulfide stage (stage IV) (Fig. 4b-f, and 6). During the late sulfide stage (stage V), sphalerite, galena, and small amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite are precipitated (Fig. 4g-i and 6).\n\n\n4\nSampling and analytical procedures\nTwenty-one intrusion, ore, and wall rock samples were collected from the surface in the Hahaigang deposit, including five granodiorite samples (H03-1, H03-2, H02, H07, and H126), four monzogranite samples (H05, H29, H47, and H49-1), five ore samples (H10, H57, H58, H107, and H27), and six slate and sandstone wall rock samples (H30, H35, H103, H06, H36, H111). All samples were examined by optical microscopy. Five granodiorite and monzogranite samples were selected for the assessment of whole-rock major elements and rare earth elements. Three granodiorite samples (H03-1, H07, and H126), two monzogranite samples (H47 and H49-1), and all ore and wall rocks samples were selected for Pb isotopic analysis. One monzonite sample (H05) and one granodiorite sample (H126) were selected for testing U-Pb zircon ages and zircon Hf isotope analysis. Nine metal sulfides from samples H57, H58, H27, and H107, and six wall rock samples were subjected to S isotopic analysis.\nZircon grains were extracted from approximately 4\u20135\u00a0kg of granodiorite and monzogranite by crushing, sieving, and heavy-liquid and magnetic separation techniques. After examination using a binocular microscope, zircon grains were selected, mounted in epoxy resin, and polished to approximately one-third of their thickness. Cathodoluminescence (CL) images were taken at the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing to characterize the internal structures and select appropriate spots for zircon isotope analyses. The detailed operating conditions of the U\u2013Pb age for the laser ablation system and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument and data reduction are identical to those described by Liu et al. (2008, 2010) at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (GPMR), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan. During the LA-ICP-MS analysis, U\u2013Th\u2013Pb concentrations were calibrated using the NIST SRM 610 external standard combined with internal standardization (Si). GJ-1, a secondary standard for controlling the accuracy of age detection, yielded results of 600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.26, n\u00a0=\u00a08), which had identical errors to the published values (Jackson et al., 2004). Isoplot (version 4.5; Ludwig, 2003) was used for plotting concordia diagrams and age spectra, as well as for calculating ages. The analytical results of zircon U\u2013Pb dating are shown in Tables S1 and S2. Zircon Ce anomalies, log fO2 values, and Ti\u2013in\u2013zircon temperatures were determined using the methods described by Ballard et al. (2002), Ferry and Watson (2007), and Trail et al. (2011, Trail et al. (2012). Detailed computational methods and processes can be found in Chen et al. (2020).\nZircon Hf isotopic analyses were carried out at the Wuhan Sample Solution Analytical Technology Co., Ltd, Hubei. The detailed operating conditions of the laser ablation system and the MC-ICP-MS instrument and analytical method are identical to those described by Hu et al. (2015). Off-line selection and integration of analytical signals and mass bias calibrations were performed using ICPMSDataCal_ver10.9 (Liu et al., 2010). Zircon 91,500 and GJ-1 were used as the reference standards, with respective 176Hf\/177Hf ratios of 0.282296\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000005(2\u03c3, n\u00a0=\u00a010) and 0.282004\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000011 (2\u03c3, n\u00a0=\u00a04). These values agreed with the published data of 0.282307\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000031 and 0.282000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000005 (Morel et al., 2008; Blichert-Toft, 2008). Calculations for zircon \u03b5Hf(t) values and depleted Hf model ages (TDM) are described in Gao et al. (2019) and the references therein.\nMajor and trace element analyses of nine granodiorite and monzogranite samples were conducted at the Hubei Province Geological Experimental Testing Center following the procedures of Zhang et al. (2006) and Qian et al. (2013) (Table S4). Major element analyses had analytical uncertainties less than 0.5% and trace and rare-earth elements had analytical uncertainties less than 5%. Whole-rock and metallic minerals S and Pb isotopic ratios were determined at the Analytical Center of the Beijing Institute of Geology for Nuclear Industry. Detailed operating conditions of the analytical method are identical to those described by Jiang et al. (2018). The results for the S-Pb isotopic ratios are shown in Tables S5 and S6.\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nLA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating\nZircons from the granodiorite and monzogranite are generally euhedral\u2013subhedral prismatic and 50\u2013120\u00a0\u03bcm in size, with distinct oscillatory zoning in the cathodoluminescence (CL) image (Fig. 7\na-b). Eighteen spot analyses on the granodiorite sample (H126) yield U (325\u20132569\u00a0ppm) and Th (225\u20131560\u00a0ppm), with Th\/U ratios of 0.26\u20130.85 (Table S1), showing typical magmatic zircon characteristics (Table S1; Corfu et al, 2003; Wu and Zheng, 2004; Chen et al., 2019). They have 206Pb\/238U ages of 63.4\u201364.6\u00a0Ma, and a weighted mean age of 64.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.35) (Fig. 7a-b), which represent the magmatic crystallization age, indicating that the granodiorite was formed in the Paleocene. Sixteen spot analyses of the monzogranite (H05) have middle U (781\u20134644\u00a0ppm), Th (317\u20131760\u00a0ppm), and Th\/U\u00a0=\u00a00.26\u20130.77 (Table S1). They yield 206Pb\/238U ages ranging from 64.0\u00a0Ma to 65.7\u00a0Ma, and a similar weighted mean age of 64.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.3) (Fig. 7a-b).\n\n\n5.2\nZircon Hf isotope systematics\nThe results of Hf isotopic analysis for zircons from granodiorite and monzogranite samples (H126 and H05) are listed in Table S3 and shown in Fig. 8\n. Eleven analyses of zircon from the granodiorite with Paleocene age yield initial 176Hf\/177Hf ratios between 0.282723 and 0.282862, and \u03b5Hf(t) values ranging from \u22120.8 to\u00a0+\u00a04.2 with two-stage crustal model ages (TDM2) from 0.84 to 1.15\u00a0Ga (Fig. 8). Zircons from the monzogranite have similar Hf isotopes compared to the granodiorite, with initial 176Hf\/177Hf ratios from 0.282717 to 0.282837 and \u03b5Hf(t) values from \u22121.0 to\u00a0+\u00a03.3 with a TDM2 between 0.90 and 1.17\u00a0Ga (Fig. 8).\n\n\n5.3\nWhole-rock major and trace elements geochemistry\nGranodiorite is characterized by high silicon content (SiO2\u00a0=\u00a068.58% to 71.51%), aluminum (Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a014.42%\u201316.07%), and alkali (Na2O\u00a0=\u00a03.05%\u20134.82%), and high zircon saturation temperatures (761\u2013793\u00a0\u00b0C; Hanchar and Watson, 2003), and low magnesium content (MgO\u00a0=\u00a00.72%\u20131.70%) (Table S4). The differentiation index (DI) ranges from 78.77 to 84.21. The monzogranite samples have high contents of SiO2 (73.69\u201376.28\u00a0wt%), Al2O3 (12.83\u201313.52\u00a0wt%), and K2O (5.01\u20135.88\u00a0wt%), with K2O\/Na2O\u00a0=\u00a01.47\u20133.27, A\/CNK (molar A12O3\/(CaO\u00a0+\u00a0Na2O\u00a0+\u00a0K2O))\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u20131.15, and DI\u00a0=\u00a087.12\u201395.66 (Table S4), but low contents of MgO (0.06\u20130.31\u00a0wt%), Mg# (19\u201346), Sr\/Y ratios (0.44\u20131.14) and zircon saturation temperatures (694\u2013699\u00a0\u00b0C; Hanchar and Watson, 2003; Table S4). On the TAS diagram, the granodiorite and monzogranite belong to the sub- alkaline series and plot in the granodiorite and granite field, respectively (Fig. 9\na). All samples are high-K calc-alkaline rocks in the SiO2-K2O diagram and fall into the calc-alkaline series, except for two granodiorite samples (Fig. 9b). The A\/CNK of all samples ranges from 1.02 to 1.27, which is in the peraluminous field (Fig. 9c). These granitic rocks with other magmatic rocks of 60\u201370\u00a0Ma in the Lhasa terrane (Mo et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2009, 2015; Wang et al., 2017) have clear linear trends in the Harker diagrams (Fig. 10\n). The monzogranite samples are distinctly more felsic in composition than the granodiorite (e.g., higher SiO2, but lower TFe2O3, MgO, TiO2, Al2O3, MnO, and CaO). Meanwhile, the monzogranite tends to have higher contents of incompatible elements and volatiles such as B, Sn, and Y (Fig. 11\n). Some metal elements (W, Sn, and Zn) and zircon saturation temperatures (Hanchar and Watson, 2003; Boehnke et al., 2013) may have decreased due to the release of ore materials from the magma to ore-forming fluids (Fig. 11).\nAll granodiorite samples are characterized by similar rare earth element (REE) signatures, with steep light rare earth elements (LREE) and flat heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns. They have (La\/Yb)N ratios ranging from 4.36 to 25.16 and weak negative Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu* =0.48\u20130.75) (Fig. 12\na). The presence of significant Nb, Ta, P, Ti, and Zr negative anomalies is seen on the primitive mantle-normalized patterns (Fig. 12b). The monzogranite samples have flat LREE and HREE patterns ((La\/Yb)N\u00a0=\u00a01.13 to 1.31) with obvious Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu* =0.08\u20130.15) (Fig. 12a). They are enriched in K, Ta, Pb, and Zr, and depleted in Ba, La, Ce, Sr, P, Eu, and Ti in the primitive mantle-normalized diagram (Fig. 12b).\n\n\n5.4\nS-Pb isotope systematics\nThe S isotopic compositions of the Hahaigang deposit are listed in Table S5. S isotopic compositions of sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite from the Haihaigang deposit have uniform \u03b434SV\u2010CDT values (2.2\u2030\u20135.4\u2030). The \u03b434S values range from 2.7\u2030 to 3.0\u2030 for two galena samples (average of 2.85 \u2030), 5.0\u2030 for two sphalerite samples (average of 2.17\u2030), and 3.1\u2030 to 4.6\u2030 for three pyrite samples (average of 4.1\u2030). Chalcopyrite and molybdenite samples yield \u03b434S values of 5.4 and 3.3, respectively. A total of six wall rock samples from the Hahaigang deposit have \u03b434S values ranging from 2.2\u2030 to 5.5\u2030 (average of 3.35\u2030) (Fig. 13\n).\nThe Pb isotopic compositions of the Hahaigang deposit are listed in Table S6. The 206Pb\/204Pb, 207Pb\/204Pb, and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios of six sulphides range from 18.479 to 18.515, 15.667 to 15.699, and 38.932 to 39.003, respectively, which are partially consistent with those of the ore-related granodiorite and monzogranite (206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a018.600\u201318.926, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.635\u201315.677, and 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a038.869\u201338.968) (Fig. 14\n). Pb isotope ratios of the granodiorite and monzogranite are corrected to a U-Pb age of 64\u00a0Ma, and the calculated initial (206Pb\/204Pb)t, (207Pb\/204Pb)t, and (208Pb\/204Pb)t ratios range from 18.434 to 18.644, 15.624 to 15.662, and 38.712 to 38.853, respectively (Fig. 14). The sandstone and slate wall rocks have a relatively large range of 206Pb\/204Pb (18.196 to 19.479), 207Pb\/204Pb (15.594 to 15.732), and 208Pb\/204Pb ratios (38.328 to 39.503).\n\n\n5.5\nCalculation of Ti-in-zircon thermometry and magmatic oxygen fugacity\nZircon trace element contents from the granodiorite and monzogranite are listed in Table S2, with their chondrite-normalized REE patterns illustrated in Fig. 15\na. No inherited zircons were identified in the samples based on the age results. These new zircons have pronounced HREE enrichment and positive Ce but negative Eu anomalies, similar to typical magmatic zircons (Fig. 14a; Table S2; Corfu et al, 2003; Wu and Zheng, 2004). Zircons from the granodiorite have Ti contents of 0.86\u20135.61\u00a0ppm for sample H126 and the Ti-in-zircon temperatures (Ferry and Watson, 2007) for sample H126 range from 557 to 694\u00a0\u00b0C (average of 619\u00a0\u00b0C). Zircons from sample H05 have Ti ppm values ranging from 0.68 to 7.51 and the corresponding temperatures range from 543 to 720\u00a0\u00b0C with an average of 606\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 15b; Table S2). The Ti-in-zircon temperature is lower than the whole-rock zircon saturation temperature. Generally, Ti-in-zircon thermometers are biased about 50\u00b0higher than the magma formation temperature (Watson and Harrison, 2005). The calculated Ce4+\/Ce3+ ratios of the granodiorite sample H126 range from 171 to 747 (average of 468) and the log(fO2) values from\u00a0\u2212\u00a016.1 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a010.6 (average of \u221212.7) along the MH buffer line in the Ti\u2013in\u2013zircon temperature vs. log(fO2) diagram (Fig. 15b-c). The calculated Ce4+\/Ce3+ of 42 to 417 (average 540) and log(fO2) values range from\u00a0\u2212\u00a024.9 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a013.2 (average of\u00a0\u2212\u00a017.1) between the FMQ and MH buffer lines for the zircons from the monzogranite (sample H126), which are distinctly lower than those of the granodiorite (Fig. 15b-c; Table S2). This finding is consistent with the result that granodiorites have higher Fe2O3\/FeO ratios as compared to monzogranite (Fig. 15d; Hart et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nPetrogenesis of granodiorite and monzogranite\nThe loss on ignition (LOI) of the Hahaigang monzogranite and granodiorite is less than 3% (Table S4), and the plagioclase phenocrysts are relatively clear (Fig. 3), suggesting that the granodiorite and monzogranite show weak alteration. There are no correlations between the LOI and the major elements (e.g., SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, and P2O5) or between the LOI and the large ion lithophile element (LILE; e.g., Sr, Ba), REE (e.g., La, Nd, Eu, Dy, and Yb) contents, indicating that these elements were relatively immobile during alteration. Therefore, petrogenesis can be constrained by the major elements, REEs, and high field strength elements (HFSEs) coupled with Hf-Pb isotope studies.\nZircon U-Pb ages of the monzogranite and granodiorite from the Hahaigang deposit are 64.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma and 64.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma, respectively, revealing that they temporally formed in the Paleogene. The granodiorite and monzogranite have high silicon, A\/CNK, and potassium contents (Fig. 9a-c). They are enriched in LILE (e.g., Rb, Ba) and relatively depleted in HFSE (e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti) with negative Eu anomalies (Fig. 12). These features demonstrate that the Paleocene granodiorite and monzogranite not only have the characteristics of peraluminous granite but also show the features of sodium-rich I-type granites and the silicon- and potassium-rich and phosphorus-poor characteristics of A-type granites. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish them through detailed geochemical studies. In the (K2O\u00a0+\u00a0Na2O)\/CaO vs (Zr\u00a0+\u00a0Nb\u00a0+\u00a0Ce\u00a0+\u00a0Y) diagram (Fig. 9d; Whalen et al., 1987), the monzogranite is mainly located in the highly differentiated granite, and the granodiorite falls within the undifferentiated granite area, suggesting that these granites are completely different from the A-type granite. The Ti-in-zircon temperatures and zircon saturation temperatures of the granodiorite and monzogranite range from 543\u00a0\u00b0C to 793\u00a0\u00b0C (Hanchar and Watson, 2003; Ferry and Watson, 2007), which are also significantly lower than the average temperatures of A-type granites (830\u2013900\u00a0\u00b0C; Creaser et al., 1991). This finding suggests that these granites are not A-type granites, but rather I-type and S-type granites.\nGenerally, the P2O5 content of I-type granites decreases with increasing SiO2 content in the whole-rock composition, whereas that of S-type granite increases significantly with SiO2 content (Chappell, 1999), and this has been demonstrated in many studies (Wu et al., 2003a; 2003b; Li et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2020). This is because apatite is saturated in meta-aluminous magmas (A\/CNK\u00a0less than\u00a01.1) but remains highly soluble in strongly peraluminous magmas (Wolf and London, 1994). Such different behaviors of apatite in I- and S-type granitic melts have been successfully used to distinguish I- and S-type granitoids (Chappell, 1999). The negative correlation between P2O5 and SiO2 contents in the granodiorite and monzogranite is consistent with the characteristics of I-type granite (Fig. 10g). Moreover, the P2O5 contents of the granodiorite and monzogranite are less than 0.15%, which are inconsistent with S-type granites (>0.20%, Chappell, 1999). Clemens and Stevens (2012) showed that as the SiO2 content increases, I-type granites gradually transit from meta-aluminous (A\/CNK\u00a0less than\u00a01.1) to peraluminous (A\/CNK\u00a0>\u00a01.1), whereas the A\/CNK value of S-type granites remains constant or slightly decreases. Moreover, S-type granites often show strong peraluminous characteristics of A\/CNK\u00a0>\u00a01.1, while I-type granites usually have A\/CNK values that are less than 1.1 (Chappell, 1999). The A\/CNK ratios of the granodiorite and monzogranite are between 1.0 and 1.27 and most of them are located in the area of A\/CNK\u00a0less than\u00a01.1, which is consistent with the characteristics of I-type granitoids (Fig. 9c). At the same time, there is a positive correlation between Th and Rb in the Haihaigang granodiorite and monzogranite (Fig. 10\nh), which further indicates that they are I-type granites. Moreover, they have moderate \u03b5Hf(t) (-1.0 to\u00a0+\u00a04.2) values that are consistent with I-type granites, indicating that they formed by the recycling of continental crust and the introduction of juvenile crust. In addition, the monzogranite has a strong REE tetrad effect with relatively flat REE patterns (Fig. 16\n) and huge negative Eu anomalies (Fig. 12a), demonstrating a highly differentiated feature.\nHighly differentiated I-type granites may have the following two origins: (1) produced by the extreme fractional crystallization of mantle-derived mafic magmas (Wu et al., 2003a; 2003b; Wang et al., 2014); (2) intrusion of mantle wedge basaltic magmas in the crust that causes anatexis, forming hybrid melts (Wu et al., 2003a; 2003b; Zhu et al., 2009). The granodiorite and monzogranite display progressively low \u03b5Hf(t) and high TDM2 values (Fig. 8), suggesting a slightly increasing crustal component. However, extreme fractional crystallization of the mantle-derived mafic magmas does not appear to be the case. The granitic rocks exhibiting relatively high (206Pb\/204Pb), (207Pb\/204Pb), and (208Pb\/204Pb) ratios (Fig. 14) are similar to the previously Proterozoic basement of the Nyainqentanglha Group (Fig. 14; Gari\u00e9py et al., 1985), suggesting that they mainly originated from anatexis of the continental crust basement. Similarly, the \u03b5Hf(t) values (-1.0 to\u00a0+\u00a04.2) of the granodiorite and monzogranite also indicate that Paleogene granitic magmatism in the Hahaigang deposit was dominantly sourced from the anatexis of old continental crust that was modified by mantle-derived melts. The hybrid granitic melt rose through the crust and formed magma chambers in the upper crust. In the magma chamber, the geochemical features of high DI, silica-richness, and marked depletion in Ba, Nb, Ta, Sr, P, Ti, and Eu indicate that these magmas underwent significant fractional crystallization (Figs. 11-12; Zhu et al., 2009). The monzogranite has higher SiO2, P2O5, Th, and Rb contents with an REE tetrad effect than the granodiorite (Figs. 11 and 16), indicating that the degree of crystallization differentiation of the monzogranite is higher than that of the granodiorite.\n\n\n6.2\nW-Mo Mineralization connections in the highly evolved magmatic systems of the Hahaigang deposit\nThe granodiorite and monzogranite in the Hahaigang deposit can be regarded as a highly evolved magmatic system with W-Mo mineralization. The pieces of evidence are as follows: (1) the age of the granodiorite is similar to that of the monzogranite (Fig. 3). (2) The granodiorite has developed medium- to coarse-grained granitic and equigranular texture, whereas the monzogranite has a fine-grained and porphyritic-like texture (Fig. 3), indicating that the granodiorite is of plutonic facies while the monzonitic granite is of hypabyssal facies. (3) The zircon saturation temperatures of the granodiorite (761\u2013793\u00a0\u00b0C) are higher than that of the monzogranite (694\u2013699\u00a0\u00b0C), which shows that the temperature decreased during the magmatic evolution (Fig. 11i; Hanchar and Watson, 2003; Table S4). (4) The ore-related granodiorite and monzogranite have consistent whole-rock Pb and zircon Hf isotopic compositions (Figs. 8 and 14), suggesting that these magmas evolved through fractional crystallization rather than the assimilation of upper-crustal materials. (5) The monzogranite also displays consistent geochemical trends with fractional crystallization from intermediate compositions through evolved granodiorite (Figs. 3 and 4). (6) The monzogranite, with a spectacular tetrad effect in its REE distribution patterns (Fig. 16), has higher negative Eu anomalies than the granodiorite, reflecting that it has highly fractionated features. Cheng et al. (2018) identified volcanic\u2013plutonic connections and the metal fertility of highly evolved magma systems in a Queensland Sn\u2013W\u2013Mo mineral field. Their results showed that the highly evolved magma is associated with Sn\u2013W\u2013Mo mineral systems (Bachmann et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2018). Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that a highly evolved magmatic system may easily cause the enrichment of tungsten and tin in the residual fluids (Lehmann, 1982; 1987; Thomas et al., 2005; Breiter et al., 2005). When the W-rich melts evolve to the late stage, low oxygen fugacity conditions may promote tungsten removal from magmas into hydrothermal fluids and result in W mineralization (Candela and Bouton, 1990). The monzogranite has lower whole-rock Fe2O3\/FeO and zircon Ce4+\/Ce3+ ratios than that of the granodiorite, suggesting that oxygen fugacity played an important role in the W-Mo enrichment during the magma evolution process. Fractional crystallization of K-feldspar and plagioclase would decrease the contents of Sr and Ba, and consequently, increase the Rb\/Ba and Rb\/Sr ratios in the residual magma. Therefore, the low Ba and Sr contents (Fig. 10i) and increased Rb\/Sr ratios (Fig. 11) in the monzogranite record extensive feldspar fractionation. The fractional crystallization of magnetite in the I-type magmatic system results in the decrease of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cr in the residual magma (Dare et al., 2014). The low amounts of TFe2O3, P, Ti, Zr, Co, Ni, and Cr in the monzogranite as compared to the granodiorite (Figs. 10 and 12) reveals that the monzogranite underwent an extensive fractional crystallization of Fe-Ti-oxide (such as rutile and magnetite), apatite, and zircon. The fractional crystallization of magnetite also supports the idea that there is a decrease in oxygen fugacity in the monzogranite as compared to the granodiorite (Fig. 15d). Meanwhile, the decrease in the Nb\/Ta ratios in the granodiorite and monzogranite can be attributed to the fractional crystallization of Fe-Ti-oxide, because Fe-Ti-oxide, in general, has high Nb\/Ta ratios in magmatic systems (Rudnick et al., 2000; Dare et al., 2014). In conclusion, in the highly fractionated magmatic system, the fractional crystallization of Fe-Ti-oxides and feldspar resulted in the monzogranite bring crystal-rich, relatively reduced, and highly evolved as compared to the granodiorite (Fig. 17\n).\n\n\n6.3\nSource of ore-forming materials\nS-Pb isotopic compositions of metal sulfides can reveal the source of ore-forming materials (Thode et al., 1961; Chiaradia et al., 2006). Metal sulfides in the Hahaigang deposit predominately consist of galena, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite, and molybdenite. The distribution sequence of \u03b434SV\u2010CDT values of sulfides is molybdenite\u00a0>\u00a0sphalerite\u00a0>\u00a0pyrite\u00a0>\u00a0chalcopyrite\u00a0>\u00a0galena (Fig. 13). This is consistent with the accumulation sequence of \u03b434SV\u2010CDT values during sulfide crystallization (Hoefs, 1997), indicating that the sulfur isotopic fractionation between sulfides may have reached equilibrium in the ore-forming fluid in the Hahaigang deposit. The \u03b434S values for sulfides have a narrow range from 3.0 \u2030 to 5.4\u2030 (average\u00a0=\u00a04.1\u2030) in the histogram (Fig. 13). These \u03b434S values of sulfides are similar to those in the wall rocks in the Hahaigang deposit, which are slightly higher than those from magmatic-hydrothermal deposits (\u22123\u2030 to 1\u2030; Thode et al., 1961; Hoefs, 2009), suggesting the addition of sulfur from the wall rocks. Similarly, the \u03b434SV\u2010CDT values of sulfides in the W-Mo polymetallic deposit are similar to the \u03b434SV\u2010CDT values of magmatic-hydrothermal Pb-Zn deposits (Chagele, Yaguila, Narusongduo, and Dongzhongla) in the Nyainqentanglha belt, but is different from the \u03b434S values of the porphyry Cu\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Mo\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Au deposits (Zhunuo, Qulong, Xiongcun, Chongjiang, Dongga, and Nanmu) in the Gangdese belt (Fig. 13b; Zhang et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018). This is mainly because the skarn deposits are more easily influenced by the contamination of sulfur from the strata during fluid evolution and interaction (Jiang et al., 2018). Metal sulfides with high Pb isotopic ratios (208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a039.932\u201339.003, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.667\u201315.699, 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a018.479\u201318.515) plot in the field between the upper crust and the orogenic belt evolution curve in 207Pb\/204Pb vs. 206Pb\/204Pb diagram (Fig. 14). The ore-related granodiorite and monzogranite have similar Pb isotopes with the metal sulfides, suggesting that they may have contributed to the ore-forming materials in the Hahaigang deposit. The Pb isotopic ratios of metal sulfides are different from the sandstone and slate wall rocks, and similar to the Proterozoic basement rocks (Nyainqentanglha Group), implying again that the ore-forming materials were mainly derived from the anatexis of basement continental crust.\n\n\n6.4\nTectonic conditions of magmatism related to W\u2013Mo mineralization\nMetallogenic age identification is the key to determining the metallogenic tectonic setting (Hou et al., 2015a, b). Li et al. (2014) obtained the Re-Os dating of molybdenite veins in the Hahaigang deposit at 63.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma. The zircon U-Pb dating of the granodiorite and monzogranite from the study area show that their formation ages are 63.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma and 64.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, respectively. According to previous studies, from the initial collision to the post-collision of the Indian and Asian plates, the remnant Neo-Tethys oceanic plate continued to subduct, rollback, and finally break off (Kapp et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2005, 2009; Lee et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2015). It is acknowledged that the India\u2013Asia continental collision took place at\u00a0\u223c\u00a065\u201345\u00a0Ma (e.g., Patzelt et al.1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Mo et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2016). The Hahaigang W-dominated skarn deposit has been determined to have formed in the Paleocene, during the initial collision stage of the Indian and Asian plates (Fig. 17; Li et al., 2014). The mineralization age is close to that of the Sharang Mo and the Yaguila Pb-Zn deposits (Sun et al., 2017). In general, it was difficult for collisional orogeny to produce giant deposits because there was a lack of fluids associated with mineralization in a compressional regime (Zheng et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020). Thus, a slab rollback of a northward subducted Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab has been proposed to explain the southward migration of Paleocene to Eocene (65\u201350\u00a0Ma) magmatism in the CLS and SLS (Lee and Lawver, 1995; Chung et al., 2005, 2009; Kapp et al., 2005, 2007; Jiang et al., 2018). This rollback of subducted Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab caused the upwelling of the asthenosphere and the creation of abundant melts\/fluids that interacted with the mantle wedge and resulted in crust-mantle interactions, producing large-scale mafic magmatism (Gao et al., 2020). The mantle-derived magma underplating to the bottom of the thickened lower crust induced partial melting to form hybrid granitic magma (Hou et al. 2015a; Fig. 17). The magma associated with W-Mo mineralization was further formed by the fractional crystallization of granitic magma in the secondary magma chamber (Fig. 17). This result is consistent with the abundant Pb\u2013Zn\u2013(Ag) mineralization events in the central Lhasa subterrane, which are mainly magmatic in origin, and are closely associated with the partial melting of the ancient basement (Fu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2020).\n\n\n6.5\nImplications for four W-dominated metallogenic events in the Lhasa terrane\nBased on the tectonic evolution of the continental collision of the Indian and Asian plates and the molybdenite Re-Os geochronology of the W-(Mo-Cu) deposits, four generations of porphyry W-(Mo-Cu) deposits are identified in the Lhasa terrane (Fig. 18\na). The first stage of the Paleocene skarn W-Mo deposit is distinguished in the Hahaigang area of the CLS (Fig. 18a; Li et al., 2014). The W-Mo deposit is associated with syn-collisional magmatism related to the initial collision of the Indian and Asian continental plates. They have middle zircon \u03b5Hf(t) values, old Hf model ages, and middle Re content in the molybdenite (Fig. 18b-c), indicating that the old continental crust contributed to W-Mo mineralization. The second stage of the Miocene (25\u201323\u00a0Ma) skarn W-Mo-Cu deposit formed in the Nuri area (Fig. 18a; Zhang et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2020). They also have higher molybdenite Re contents and \u03b5Hf(t) values than the W-related granite in the SLS (Zhang et al. 2012; Wang et al., 2018c), indicating that the mantle materials played a more crucial role in the skarn W-Mo-Cu mineralization than during the first stage of the skarn W-Mo mineralization. The third stage of the Miocene greisen-type Mo-Cu deposits formed in the Jiagang area of the CLS (Fig. 18a; Xu et al., 2020). The ore-related peraluminous S-type granites have the lowest molybdenite Re contents and \u03b5Hf(t) values of\u00a0\u2212\u00a013.8 to\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.3 (Fig. 18b-c), suggesting that they were derived from the anatexis of metasedimentary rocks (Xu et al., 2020). The fourth stage of the Miocene quartz vein-type W deposit formed in the Jiaoxi area (Fig. 19a; Wang et al., 2018b, 2020). The enriched Hf isotope data of the zircon and the low Re content of the molybdenite in the ore-related intrusions (Fig. 18b-c) indicate that the granites were derived from the partial melting of a crustal source with a minor mantle contribution (Wang et al., 2018b, 2020).\nIn the Lhasa terrane, the existence of the four generations of W-dominated polymetallic metallogenic events offers evidence that it has significant metallogenic potential for tungsten deposits. The Lhasa terrane experienced strong shortening and thickening of the continental crust (Hou et al., 2015a, b; Xu et al., 2020). Abundant Paleocene and Miocene mafic, ultrapotassic, adakitic-like magmatic rocks, potassic magmatic rocks, and highly fractionated granite were generated during the continental collision and post-collision processes between the Indian and Asian plates (Miller et al., 1999; Williams et al., 2004; Chung et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a). The ore-related magma in the Hahaigang deposit has high DI and tetrad REE patterns with large negative Eu anomalies, which demonstrates that the ore-related granite has highly differentiated characteristics. The ore-related magma in Jiaoxi and Jiagang also shows the features of post-collisional highly evolved granite related to tungsten mineralization (Xu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Many previous studies have shown that differentiated granites provide favorable conditions for forming rare metal deposits (e.g., Jahn et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 2016a). The magmatic oxidation state is also a critical factor for the occurrence of tungsten mineralization (Candela and Bouton, 1990; Bali et al., 2012). In the Hahaigang deposit, data on both the monzogranite and granodiorite fall between the FMQ and MH buffer lines in the temperature vs. log(fO2) diagram, revealing that the ore-related magmas are both relatively reduced (Fig. 15b). The zircon Ce4+\/Ce3+ and log(fO2) values of the highly fractionated monzogranite are distinctly lower than those of the granodiorite, indicating that low fugacity conditions may be more favorable for tungsten mineralization than normal magmatic rocks in a highly evolved magma system. In general, the Nb\/Ta ratios of whole-rock related to W-Sn and rare metal mineralization are usually less than 5 (Ballouard et al., 2016). The highly fractionated monzogranite in this study has Nb\/Ta ratios of 3.5\u20134.9, indicating a high metallogenetic potential. The granodiorite, with Nb\/Ta ratios from 9.2 to 16.5, falls in the field of barren granites (Ballouard et al., 2016). This is consistent with our field observations that tungsten mineralization is mainly associated with monzogranite. The ore-forming monzogranites in the Jiaoxi and Jiagang deposits are strongly peraluminous S-type granites (Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020); however, tungsten ore-related magma in Hahaigang may be related to I-type granitoids. In the Lhasa terrane, this, therefore, suggests that both the highly evolved Cenozoic I-type and S-type granitic magmas could provide greater potential for tungsten mineralization. From the perspective of structure, the Paleocene to Miocene granitic rocks and associated tungsten mineralization in the Lhasa terrane were triggered by the rollback and the gradual break-off of the Indian continental lithospheric slab (Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; also this study). The rollback and gradual break-off of the Indian continental lithospheric slab correspond to a relatively extensional tectonic setting during the collision setting. Such conditions can aid the formation of abundant magma systems associated with highly evolved features. The system is common in the thick Lhasa terrane and can provide important useful information for understanding regional-scale tungsten mineralization and its exploration.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThis study established the relationship of W-Mo mineralization with a highly evolved and relatively reduced magmatic system using whole-rock geochemistry, geochronology, and Hf-Pb isotope signatures of ore-related granodiorite and monzogranite in the Hahaigang deposit, Tibet. The W-Mo mineralization is temporally, spatially, and genetically associated with the contemporaneous monzogranite and granodiorite. These rocks represent a felsic magma system and have been derived from a similar source. The monzogranites show more highly fractionated features but lower oxygen fugacity than the granodiorite. This condition points to the fractionation crystallization of Fe-Ti-oxides during magmatic evolution. The W\u2013Mo ore-related magma formed at ca.64\u00a0Ma, in response to the syn-collisional setting of the Asian and Indian plates. Ore-related granites may have formed during a rollback of the subducting Indian slab, which caused asthenosphere upwelling and resulted in mantle\u2013crust interactions that produced highly fractionated I-type granites. S-Pb isotopes of metal sulfides indicate that the ore-forming materials were mainly derived from granitic magma with small contributions from the wall rock. Combined with results from previous studies, four W-dominated polymetallic metallogenic events are identified in the Lhasa terrane. This terrane has an abundant highly fractionated magmatic system due to the shortening and thickening of the continental crust in the collision setting. For these reasons, it has significant metallogenic potential for tungsten deposits. The results of this study greatly advance the understanding of how different magmatic rock types develop in relation to W-Mo mineralization and how this mineralization forms in highly evolved magma during collisional orogeny.\n\n","77":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe North China Craton (NCC) can be divided into the eastern block, Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO), and western block (Ordos block), respectively (Fig. 1\n). The eastern block has been completely decratonized (e.g., Yang et al., 2008; Li et al., 2020), whereas the western block remains largely stable. The lithospheric thinning and decratonization of the NCC commenced along its northern and eastern margins during the Middle-Late Triassic by post-collisional or postorogenic lithospheric delamination, and then continued into the center of the craton during the Late Mesozoic (Zhang et al., 2014 and references therein). The NCC experienced extensive hydrothermal mineralization during the late Mesozoic, forming the world\u2019s largest Mo deposit in its southern and northern margins (Mao et al., 2011; Li et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2021), as well as gold mineralized provinces (Fig. 1). Among them, the Jiaodong gold province is unique for postdating their Precambrian metamorphic wall-rocks by about 2 billion years (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014). It represents one of the largest gold provinces in the world with known gold resources of\u00a0greater than\u00a05000\u00a0t (non-JORC compliant; Deng et al., 2020).\nThe \u2018Jiaodong-type\u2019 orogenic gold deposits formed at about ca. 120\u00a0Ma during a change of the subduction orientation of the paleo-Pacific Plate and a resulting transition of the tectonic stress regime from regional compression to transpression or transtension prior to peak extension caused by thinning of the lithosphere (Yang et al., 2003; Deng et al., 2020 and references therein). The known gold reserves of the Jiaodong gold province are progressively exploited and ongoing brownfields exploration is increasingly focused on concealed orebodies. Deep Drilling for scientific research and gold exploration in the Jiaojia Gold Belt of the Liaodong Peninsula (3266.06\u00a0m deep) intersected the gold alteration belt at the depth of 2428.00\u00a0\u223c\u00a03234.16\u00a0m, with thickness of 806.16\u00a0m. The total thickness of the gold mineralization zone is 180.69\u00a0m, and 6 layers of gold ore bodies are about 25.20\u00a0m (Xiong et al., 2018). The rock types of these gold-bearing strata are pyritic sericitized cataclasite and pyritic sericitized granitic cataclastic rocks (Sun et al., 2020). These significant intercepts confirm the high exploration potential for concealed and deep gold mineralization in the Jiaodong District. However, no large and super-large gold deposits have been discovered in the Liaodong gold district to date. In order to evaluate the exploration potential for concealed gold deposits at the eastern margin of the NCC, especially in the less explored Liaodong Province, we compare relevant gravity and magnetic data from both the Liaodong and Jiaodong provinces. Our geophysical interpretation documents the similarities and differences between their respective structural settings and proposing a high exploration potential for concealed gold mineralization at the less explored Liaodong Peninsula.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting of the Liaodong and Jiaodong Peninsulae\nThe Liaodong Peninsula represents the northeastern part of the North China Craton. It is bounded by the Tancheng-Lujiang Fault Zone (TLF) to the west and the Yalujiang River Fault Zone (YRF) to the east (Fig. 2\n; Liu et al., 2020). The exposed Precambrian rocks can be divided into three regions on the peninsula: the Anshan-Fushun Archaean complex in the north, the Jinzhou Archaean complex in the south, and the Liao-He group and Liao-Ji granite between them. The Archaean basement rocks of the peninsula are mainly tonalite gneisses and granitic gneisses (Quan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2005a; Wu et al., 2005b). The Liao-He group is composed mainly of low- and medium-grade metamorphic rocks such as green-schist, gneiss, marble, and amphibolite, which cover the Archaean metamorphic rocks and form part of the basement with the Archaean trondhjemite-tonalite- granodiorite. After metamorphism, a thick sedimentary sequence was deposited during the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic, forming the Liao-He group. Many Mesozoic intrusive rocks have been identified on Liaodong Peninsula, with some volcanic rocks also exposed nearby. Three phases of igneous activity are distinguished: Triassic (233\u2013212\u00a0Ma), Jurassic (180\u2013156\u00a0Ma), and Early Cretaceous (131\u2013117\u00a0Ma; Wu et al., 2005a; Wu et al., 2005b). They are generally felsic and occur as batholiths and stocks as well as dikes. The Triassic granitoid and alkaline intrusive rocks were formed either after the collision of the North China Craton with the Siberian Craton, or during the Permo-Triassic collision of the South China Block with the North China Craton (Yang et al., 2011). However, the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous intrusive granitoids are regionally distributed along NE- and NNE-trending magmatic belts and are the products of lithospheric thinning and extension that occurred after the westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate (Sun et al., 2012). The main regional NE trending faults include the Yalujiang River Fault Zone (YRF), Zhuanghe-Huanren Fault Zone (ZHF), and Fushun-Yingkou Fault Zone (part of the TLF) from east to west (Fig. 2). These strike-slip regional faults always have a complex history of both sinistral and dextral movements from the Late Jurassic to the Cretaceous, and may have played a leading role in the tectonic evolution and gold mineralization of the Liaodong Peninsula.\nDivided by the NE-trending lithospheric Zhuanhe-Huanren Fault Zone (ZHF in Fig. 2), the eastern and western districts of the Liaodong Peninsula have different mineralization styles. The eastern part of the Liaodong Province mainly contains quartz vein-type gold deposits such as Wulong and Xinfang, respectively (refer to No. 1 and 3 in Fig. 2). However, there is still a small amount of structurally controlled alteration assemblages, for example, the Sidaogou deposit (No.2 in Fig. 2). By contrast, the gold mineralization in the western Liaodong Province is commonly controlled by structures, especially low-angle faults, such as the Baiyun, Jianshangou deposits (No. 4 and 5 in Fig. 2). Gold deposits are less commonly found in high-angle fault zones; for example, the Maoling deposits (No.6 in Fig. 2).\nThe Jiaodong Peninsula represents the southeastern part of the North China Craton. It is bounded by the Tanlu fault to the west and the Sulu UHPM orogenic belt in the East (Fig. 3\n). The Sulu orogenic belt was formed by the collision between the North China Craton and the Yangtze craton during the Triassic (Li, 1994; Zheng, 2008). The Subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North China Craton began during the Jurassic and it was accompanied by the formation of significant hydrothermal gold deposits (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhai et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2015). Precambrian metamorphic rock sequences and Mesozoic magmatic rocks are widespread in the Jiaodong region (Zhou and Li, 2000). During the late Mesozoic, extensive magmatism took place with the emplacement of a series of granitoids and mafic dikes. The granitoids of the Jiaodong area can be divided into two major suites: (1) the Linglong granite and (2) the Guojialing granodiorite. Younger mafic dikes including lamprophyres and dolerite-porphyries intersect both the Linglong and Guojialing granitoid complexes as well as Precambrian basement. The Precambrian metamorphic rocks include tonalite-throndhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) gneiss, amphibolite and mafic granulite (Zhang et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2007).\nGold deposits in the Jiaodong Peninsula are generally classified as (1) Jiaojia type (disseminated- stockwork-style) and (2) Linglong type (auriferous quartz-sulfide vein style) (Qiu et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014;Deng et al., 2015). The deposits, typically hosted by granitic intrusions and sited at the footwalls of small structures, are spatially associated with major NE- to NNE-trending oblique-slip fault zones that are related to the subparallel trending regional Tan-Lu structural corridor to the west. According to the 40Ar\/39Ar dating of hydrothermal muscovite and U-Pb dating of hydrothermal monazite (e.g., Zhang et al., 2020, and references therein), both (1) and (2) types were formed nearly at the same time (\u223c120\u00a0Ma), although their mode of occurrence and ore textures are different (Zhai et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2006).\n\n\n3\nGravity and magnetic anomalies of the Liaodong Peninsula and structural control on the gold mineralization\n\n3.1\nGravity and magnetic anomalies of the Liaodong Peninsula\nThe densities in the different strata of the Liaodong Peninsula are gradually increasing as their ages grow older. In the Liao-He Group, the average density of Dashiqiao formation is the highest, followed by the Gaixian and Gaojiayu formations (see Table. 1\n). The density value of acid intrusive rocks is generally lower than that of surrounding rocks. The vast majority of the Mesozoic intrusive rocks are granites (Table 2\n), with rare mafic intrusions appearing as dykelets. The granites are typically defined by lower density values than the marbles and schists of the wallrock sediments. As documented in Table 1, the strata of the Liaodong Peninsula generally have low magnetic susceptibilities. However, mineralized sediments may locally have high susceptibilities, probably due to the presence of hydrothermal pyrrhotites. The Archaean gneiss basement, as well as fault-controlled mafic-intermediate dikes (mainly amphibolites) typically have high susceptibilities, while the Mesozoic granitic intrusions are of weak magnetism (Table 2).\nTwo gravity highs (G1 and G2) and a large scale gravity low (G3) are illustrated in Fig. 4\na. The gravity low (G3) in the south could possibly be caused by the Moho depression beneath the Jiaoliao rift (see Fig. 6 for Moho depth estimation). The local gravity lows (\n\nG\n\nl\n\n1\n\n-\n\nG\n\nl\n\n4\n\n) are mainly the reflection of Mesozoic intermediate-acid intrusive rocks. The strata of Liaohe Group are the main ore bearing strata of gold deposits in the study area, with higher densities than the surrounding granites. Therefore, the local high gravity anomalies (\n\nG\n\nl\n\n5\n\n-\n\nG\n\nl\n\n8\n\n) could be caused by the Liaohe Group and deep supracrustal rocks. Most gold deposits are distributed in the edge of local gravity lows or around the dense gravity contour lines, which indicate that the magmatic activity provided sufficient heat sources and ore-forming materials for the gold mineralization, and shows the control of deep structures on the formation of shallow strata, rock bodies and gold deposits.\nThe large-amplitude positive magnetic anomaly (M4) corresponds to the Anshan iron ore deposit and Archaean strata. The prominent NE-trending magnetic highs (M1-M3) most likely reflect intermediate-mafic dykes in Mesozoic monzonitic granites. The gold deposits commonly sit at the margins of magnetic lows or in the transitional zones between high and low magnetic anomalies (Fig. 5\n\n), implying a stratigraphic control by the Liaohe Group and Mesozoic intrusions or a structural control by deep-seated faults on the gold mineralization.\n\n\n3.2\nStructural interpretation of gravity and magnetic data\nFelsic-intermediate intrusive rocks are defined by gravity lows while fault-controlled mafic-intermediate dikes are defined by linear high amplitude magnetic anomalies. Based on these gravity and magnetic criteria, we can infer the concealed fault system (Figs. 6 and 7\n) and buried intrusions of the Liaodong Peninsula (Fig. 8\na-c) to interpret the structural controls on the gold mineralization.\nThree NE trending (F2-F4), two NEE trending (F5, F6) and three NW trending deep faults (F7-F9) form the main tectonic framework in our study area (Figs. 6-8). They correspond to gradient zones in the regional gravity map (Fig. 4a). The Moho depth is then estimated from gravity data using a Parker-Oldenburg gravity inversion algorithm (Parker, 1973; Oldenburg, 1974). As indicated in Fig. 6, the faults are located at the transition zone between Moho uplift and depression, elucidating the distinctly deep root zones of these structures. The NE distribution of the exposed intrusive rocks implies that the magmatic activity was likely controlled by NE trending faults, especially during the Mesozoic. Mesozoic intrusive rocks are widely exposed in the Dandong and Wulong districts, probably due to tectonic uplift, while the Qingchengzi area is dominated by Paleoproterozoic granites. The Qingchengzi, Maoling and Wulong deposits are all located along the intersections of NE faults with NEE or NW faults, suggesting the structural control of the gold mineralization by deep-seated NE-trending faults (Fig. 7).\nThe concealed intrusive rocks at different depths are shown in Fig. 8a\u2013c. They are spatially associated with major NE-trending oblique-slip fault zones, suggesting the NE-trending fault zones as the main channels for magmatic upwelling. The largest intrusive pluton (YJL) is located to the west of the Qingchengzi and Maojialing deposits (Fig. 8c). The SJZ granite is probably connected with the SDG granite pluton at depth and together forming part of a large batholith. The SGL intrusion in the vicinity of the Wulong gold deposit is interpreted as a small apophysis of the partly concealed MJD stock. Magmatic activities provide an important heat source for gold mineralization in this area.\n\n\n\n4\nGravity and magnetic anomalies of the Jiaodong Peninsula and structural control on gold mineralization\nAs indicated in Table 3\n, the densities of metamorphic units in the Proterozoic and Upper Archaean are high, while the density of intrusions such as the Linglong granite is low. Magnetic susceptibility data (Table 4\n) imply high magnetite or phyrrotite contents of the Jingshan and Fenzishan Groups. The Jingshan and Fenzishan Groups form highly magnetic anomalies. The Cretaceous andesite, basalt and tuff units also have relatively high magnetic susceptibilities, at least when compared to the Linglong granite and Guojialing granodiorite.\nThe gravity lows are mainly caused by the acid volcanic rocks in the Jurassic to early Cretaceous (Yanshanian period), while the large amplitude gravity highs reflect the metamorphic strata and basement uplift. As indicated in Fig. 9\nb, a prominent gravity low (G2) (caused by the Linglong granite) is surrounded by several gravity highs (Such as G1). Gold deposits also occur near the transition zone between G2 and G1 (Fig. 9), probably reflecting a deep fault or contact zone (black dashed line). Since many gold deposits are found near the intersections of this contact zone with the NE trending faults (Sanshandao fault, Jiaojia fault and Zhaoping fault from west to east), we believe that this NEE trending fault or contact zone is closely related to the gold mineralization in the Jiaodong province.\nStrong magnetic anomalies (Table 4) usually reflect metamorphic strata such as the Jingshan and Fenzishan Groups or basement uplifts. The exposed metamorphic rocks in the southeastern part of the Jiaodong area are defined by strong, but variable, magnetic responses (Fig. 10\n). Local high magnetic anomalies usually appear at the contact zones between the intrusions and strata. The aeromagnetic anomalies in the central part of the study area (e.g., M2 in Fig. 10b) follow a NE orientation. The metamorphic rocks exposed in the southeastern part are defined by both high gravity and magnetic anomalies (Fig. 9b and 10b). Many gold deposits are located along the southern margin of magnetic high (M1) and gravity high (G1), suggesting the presence of a concealed NE- or NEE-trending deep-seated structure or lithological contact zone (dashed line in Figs. 9 and 10) representing the plumbing system for the mineralization. There are also numerous isolated gravity highs (anomaly G2 in Fig. 9b), which are correlating with NE-trending magnetic high anomalies (M2). This buried structure deserves further study for their control on the gold mineralization.\n\n\n5\nComparison between Jiaodong and Liaodong and implications for gold exploration\nThe Liaodong and Jiaodong Provinces share many similarities in terms of their lithologies, tectonic deformation history, magmatic evolution and mineral deposits, respectively. Both regions contain Archaean basement units composed of gneisses and greenstone belts that are covered by Paleo-Proterozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary sequences. The geological evolution of both provinces included tectonic extension associated with widespread and intense felsic-intermediate magmatism during the Early Cretaceous. Gold mineralization in both regions appears to be controlled by large regional structures. However, our geophysical interpretation also reveals some differences in their geological setting.\nGenerally speaking, the gravity highs are mainly caused by metamorphic strata and basement or Moho uplifts, while the gravity lows reflect low density intermediate-acid intrusive rocks, basement or Moho depressions. The Liaodong area is characterized by a large-amplitude minimum on the Bouguer gravity map (Fig. 11\n). But to the south, the amplitude of the gravity minimum in the Jiaodong peninsula is smaller, perhaps due to shallower Moho depths (Fig. 13), and the exposed Archaean basement (composed of TTG gneiss, amphibolite and mafic granulite) uplifted to the surface (Fig. 3). In the Jiaodong area, large-amplitude magnetic high corresponds to the exposed metamorphic strata, while the exposed Liaohe group at the Liaodong Peninsula can also cause positive magnetic anomalies, but their amplitude is smaller. Most Mesozoic granites generate negative magnetic anomalies. In the Liaodong Peninsula, several linear magnetic highs along NE- or NEE-trending fault zones can be seen (Fig. 12\n\n), while no such magnetic highs can be found at Jiaodong. We infer that these linear magnetic high anomalies at Liaodong are caused by basic dykes and intrusions along major faults.\nSecondly, as illustrated in Figs. 11\u201313, the gold deposits at Jiaodong are controlled by two NE trending deep-seated regional structures (the Jiaojia and Zhaoping faults, respectively), while the Liaodong gold deposits are controlled by NE-trending (F2-F4), NEE-trending (F5-F6) and NW-trending structures (F7-F9). Importantly, we propose that the Jiaojia and Zhaoping faults of the Jiaodong Peninsula are the continuations of faults F2 and F3 across the Bohai Bay (Figs. 11\u201313).\nThirdly, most intrusions of the Jiaodong and Liaodong provinces have a distinct NE orientation. Most gold deposits are controlled by faults along the contacts between Linglong granite (G2 in Fig. 9b, Yanshanian monzonitic granite) and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. In the Liaodong Peninsula, the YJL granite (also composed of Yanshanian monzonitic granite) and SJZ intrusion (Fig. 8c) also have a close spatial relationship with the gold mineralization in western Liaodong Peninsula. In addition to the above-mentioned Yanshanian granites, there are also numerous Indosinian and Paleo-Proterozoic granitic intrusions exposed in the Liaodong Province and representing potential exploration targets for gold mineralization.\nFinally, many significant gold deposits of the Jiaodong Province such as Sanshandao, Jiaojia and Linglong are located at the northern margin of the Linglong granite. They are associated with a low gravity anomaly (G2) and a magnetic high (M1) as shown in Fig. 9b and 10b. Since G2 and M1 have different orientations, we infer that they are controlled by a concealed structural intersection (black dashed line in Figs. 9\u201313). The Sanshandao, Jiaojia and Linglong deposits are all located near the intersections of this concealed structure with the JJ fault and ZP fault. At Liaodong, as implied by gravity low G1 (Fig. 4b), the YJL and SJZ intrusions are probably interconnected together at depth and forming a large, but concealed, pluton (Fig. 8a\u2013c). M5 magnetic high corresponds to the Liaohe group stratum in Fig. 5. There is a possibility that a deep concealed structure (black dash line in Figs. 11\u201313) lies beneath the contact zone between the granitic intrusions (YJL and SJZ) and the Liaohe group. The Qingchengzi gold deposit (QCZ in Figs. 11\u201313) in the Liaodong Peninsula appears to be near the intersections of this concealed structure with other faults. Other gold deposits also show strong spatial relationships with granites and regional faults. For example, the Wulong gold deposit at eastern Liaodong is situated to the northeast of the MJD intrusion (Fig. 3) and structurally controlled by the intersections between the F4 and F5 faults. Additionally, the Maoling gold deposit, located to the east of the YJL intrusion, sits on the intersection between the F3 and F8 faults (Fig. 8a\u2013c; WL and ML in Figs. 11\u201313).\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe integration of gravity and magnetic data allows us to investigate the structural elements controlling the gold mineralization in the Liaodong and Jiaodong Peninsulae, such as the fault system, granitic intrusions and the Precambrian basement metamorphic rocks.\nThe known gold deposits in both provinces are controlled by NE-trending deep, but concealed structures and their secondary faults as revealed by gravity data. On the magnetic map, the faults correspond to elongated magnetic highs. In particular, the triple-point junctions between different intrusions or structural intersections of different faults are likely the most favorable areas for gold mineralization both in the Liaodong and Jiaodong Peninsulae.\nThe gold deposits typically sit on lithological contacts between granites and basement rocks or between different granites. The incomplete cooling of host granites can induce ductile\u2013brittle conditions facilitating the final deposition of gold in the NE-trending fault system (Deng et al., 2020). The Precambrian basement metamorphic rocks, including the Archaean and Paleoproterozoic crystalline basement are defined by small-amplitude gravity and magnetic high anomalies. The shapes of concealed Mesozoic intrusions are inferred from the margins of local gravity lows, also the margins of small-scale positive magnetic anomalies.\nBased on the detailed analysis of gravity and magnetic anomalies, we interpret two significant, but concealed, structures intersecting the Liaodong and Jiaodong provinces, which are proposed to represent the contact zones between Mesozoic granites and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. The bulk of the gold mineralization at Jiaodong typically occurs at the intersections of the contact zone (S2) with the oblique NE-trending regional faults. Similarly, at Liaodong, the Qingchengzi orefield is situated at the structural intersection between the contact zone (S1) and the NE-trending faults or other secondary faults. Our data reveal that the vicinity around the Qingchengzi gold deposit, in particular along the contact zone (S1), offers significant potential for brownfields exploration. Additional integrated geological, geophysical and geochemical studies are planned to guide the ongoing exploration activities.\n\n","78":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nNumerous porphyry Mo deposits, especially Mo-only and Mo-dominant polymetallic deposits, are located in continental crust with tectonic settings including: (1) back-arc or intracontinental rifts, as illustrated by the Climax, Urad-Henderson, and Mt. Emmons\/Redwell deposits located in the Colorado mineralised zone of western USA (Wallace et al., 1978; Mutschler et al. 1981; White et al. 1981, Westra and Keith, 1981; Misra, 2000), (2) continental arc, as represented by Endako and MAX deposits in British Columbia, Canada (Selby et al., 2000; Lawley et al., 2010), and (3) orogens with major deposits such as at Shapinggou, Qianechong, and Tangjiaping in the Dabie Mountains of central East China (Mi et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017a; Chen et al., 2020). In contrast, an island-arc setting with limited continental crust is not favourable for Mo mineralisation (Chen et al., 2017b). It is therefore proposed that the contribution of ancient continental crust is critical for the genesis of Mo mineralisation (Chen et al., 2012, 2017a; Chen et al., 2017b; Zhang and Li, 2014; 2017).\nApplying the hypothesis above, the southern Great Xing'an Range (GXR) in the CAO should not to be prospective for significant Mo mineralisation, because the area is commonly thought to lack old continental crust. Furthermore, the region is commonly thought to represent Phanerozoic crustal growth characterised by the presence of immense volumes of juvenile crust (Seng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Jahn et al., 2000a; Jahn et al., 2000b; Hong et al., 2004; Windley et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2011a; Zhou and Wilde, 2013). The presence of the large-sized Bilugangan porphyry Mo deposit near the Hegenshan-Heihe Fault in southern GXR challenges this commonly held assumption. This means that the assumptions that either old continental crust is critical to the genesis of Mo mineralisation or there is no old continental crust beneath the CAO or GXR need to be questioned.\nTo address this issue, this contribution presents new data from the composite Bilugangan Granite and related Mo mineralisation. The study includes new zircon U\u2013Pb dates, precise molybdenite Re\u2013Os ages, major and trace elements geochemistry, and Nd\u2013Sr\u2013Hf isotopic systematics. The data was collected from five textually distinct granitic phases and related Mo mineralisation. This has helped us constrain the timing of the magmatism and Mo mineralisation, and gain a better understanding of the genetic relationship between porphyry Mo deposits and ancient continental crust in the CAO.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\n\n2.1\nRegional geology\nThe Xing'an\u2013Mongolia belt is located between the Mongol-Okhotsk Fault to the north and Kangbao\u2013Chifeng Fault to the south in the eastern part of the CAO. It underwent a long-term accretionary orogeny and continental crust growth related to the evolution of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean, overprinted by Mesozoic to Cenozoic interaction with the Mongol-Okhotsk and Pacific oceanic plates (Ren et al., 1990; Seng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Li, 2006; Xiao et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2015). The belt includes the Erguna, Xing'an, Songliao, and Jiamusi terranes, with the Songliao Terrane largely concealed by the Songliao Basin (Fig. 1\na, b. Each of the terranes are bound by deep-seated faults, including the Xinlin \u2013 Xiguitu, Hegenshan \u2013 Heihe, Xar Moron, and Mudanjiang \u2013 Jiayin faults (Fig. 1b; Ren et al., 1990; Seng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Li, 2006; Xiao et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2015). The southern Great Xing'an Range extends into the western part of the Songliao Terrane, and is separated from the Songliao Basin by the deep-seated Nenjiang Fault (Fig. 1c). The region includes: (1) the rarely exposed Precambrian Xilingol Complex composed of orthogneiss, paragneiss, and schist, and the age of the complex has not yet been confirmed (see discussion in Section 5.4); (2) isolated outcrops of Ordovician to Permian low-grade metamorphosed volcanic and deep-water sedimentary rocks consisting of andesite, schist, sandy slate (or shale), and marble; and (3) widespread Jurassic to Tertiary felsic to intermediate continental volcanic units interbedded with minor sedimentary units (Liu et al., 2004). The magmatism in the region took place during the Palaeozoic to Mesozoic, and mainly include: (1) limitedly ca. 321\u2013250\u00a0Ma diorite, tonalite and granodiorite; (2) locally exposed ca. 250\u2013237\u00a0Ma granodiorite, monzogranite and monzogranitic porphyry located along the Xar Moron and the Hegenshan\u2013Heihe faults; and (3) well exposed ca. 150 to 131\u00a0Ma granodiorite, monzogranite and syenogranite (Wu et al., 2011a; Zhang and Li, 2014).\nThe Mo\u2013bearing mineral deposits in the southern GXR were deposited during the Palaeozoic to Cretaceous (Fig. 1c. A small proportion of Paleozoic deposits containing subordinate Mo are known in this area, including the ca. 441\u00a0Ma Bainaimiao Cu\u2013Au\u2013Mo, ca. 298\u00a0Ma Zhunsujihua, and ca. 265\u00a0Ma Haolibao Cu(\u2013Mo) deposits (Feng et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2012c; Zeng et al., 2013). The ca. 248\u00a0Ma Baituyingzi, ca. 245\u00a0Ma Kulitu and ca. 238\u00a0Ma Bilugangan Mo deposits might represent the earliest Mo-dominant mineralisation within the region (Zeng et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a). Almost all of the large Mo-dominant deposits are Jurassic to early Cretaceous in age, such as the ca. 157\u00a0Ma Diyanqin\u2019amu, ca. 134\u00a0Ma Wurinitu, ca. 134\u00a0Ma Wulandele, and ca. 132\u00a0Ma Aolunhua Mo deposits (Tao et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2009; Bai and Zhang, 2013; Wang et al., 2017).\n\n\n2.2\nThe composite Bilugangan Granite and associated Mo mineralisation\nThe region around the Bilugangan deposit contains isolated exposures of Permian clastic and volcanic rocks, which are unconformably overlain by Tertiary to Quaternary sediments and Pleistocene basalts (Fig. 2\na; No. 6GT, 2012). The Permian sequence consist of low-grade shale, siltstone, sandstone, and lithic sandstone in the Linxi Formation unconformably overlying felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks interbedded with continental clastic sedimentary rocks in the Dashizhai Formation.\nA series of Late Palaeozoic NNE-trending composite anticlines and synclines are present in the Bilugangan area. Other structures are dominated by Mesozoic NE- and NNE- trending faults, followed by SE- and E-trending faults (No. 6GT, 2012).\nIgneous intrusions hosted by regional faults in the Bilugangan area were emplaced during the Late Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic. The Late Paleozoic intrusions are monzogranitic and dioritic porphyries located around the Chaokewenduo Obo area to the southwest of the Bilugangan deposit, which are associated with Cr-Ni-Au mineralisation. The Early Mesozoic intrusions are represented by monzogranitic porphyries around the Bilugangan area, which are related to Mo-Cu-W-Bi mineralisation (No. 6GT, 2012; Sun and Huang, 2014). Dykes are also present in this region and consist of fine-grained monzogranite, monzogranitic porphyries, quartz porphyry, aplitic granite, diorite and dioritic porphyry (No. 6GT, 2012).\nThe composite Bilugangan Granite forms discontinuous outcrops in a NE-trending area covering around 1.3\u00a0km2 and intrudes an upward-fining succession of hornfelsed sandstone and shale in the Permian Linxi Formation (Fig. 2b; No. 6GT, 2012). The types of granite include highly altered porphyritic granite (G1), porphyritic monzogranite (G2), fine- to medium-grained monzogranite (G3), and medium -grained monzogranite (G4). The exact contacts between the types of granites are difficult pinpoint due to pervasive hydrothermal alteration in the area. Diorite and monzogranitic porphyry dykes (G5) are locally present and represent the last magmatic event in the area. The characteristics of each of the phases are described in Table 1\n and shown in Fig. 3\n.\nThe top surface of the Bilugangan Granite plunges southeast forming irregular-shaped stocks (Fig. 4\n\n; No. 6GT, 2012). The granite deepens from Mineralised Zone A in the north to Mineralised Zone C in the south, with hydrothermal alteration and Mo resource increasing in the opposite direction. The mineralisation is commonly present at the top of the granitic stocks, less commonly in the bordering hornfels, and includes disseminated sulphides and stockworks of hydrothermal veins. The mineralisation forms four paragenetic stages starting with quartz \u2013 K-feldspar and progressing through quartz\u2013molybdenite and quartz\u2013molybdenite\u2013chalcopyrite\u2013pyrite to quartz\u2013fluorite\u2013calcite. The molybdenite mineralisation is closely associated with potassic \u2013 silicic \u2013sericitic alteration, and the alteration assemblage chlorite\u2013calcite\u2013fluorite\u2013clay is not spatially related to the Mo.\nThe ore at Bilugangan is stratiform and lenticular in shape, and contains molybdenite, chalcopyrite and pyrite, with lesser amounts of sphalerite, wolframite, galena, and limonite. The gangue minerals include quartz, microcline, perthite, muscovite, sericite, and minor amounts of biotite, chlorite, calcite and fluorite. Thirty-nine orebodies, including two that are Cu-rich, have been delineated in the area for a combined resource is 0.41 Mt @ 0.083% Mo and 0.016 Mt @ 0.43% Cu (No. 6GT, 2012).\n\n\n\n3\nSampling and analytical methods\n\n3.1\nSampling\nSeven molybdenite samples were collected from diamond-drillholes ZK005 and ZK305 in the Mineralised Zone B for Re-Os isotopic analyses (Fig. 2b, and 4b, c. The samples are from all of the mineralised stages of the Bilugangan deposit.\nTwelve samples were collected from the Bilugangan Granite during this study for petrographic studies, whole rock geochemistry, U-Pb zircon dating, and Lu-Hf and Sr-Nd isotope analyses (Fig. 2b and 4; Table 2\n. All samples were from diamond-drillhole core and the opencut mine. Care was taken in selecting the least altered samples for major and trace element analyses.\n\n\n3.2\nAnalytical methods\nThe Molybdenite Re-Os dating was performed using a TJA X-Series ICP-MS (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) at the National Research Centre of Geoanalysis, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), China. The zircon U-Pb dating was conducted by LA-ICP-MS at Isotopic Laboratory, Tianjin Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources of China Geological Survey. CL images of the zircons were produced using a JSM-6510 with a GATAN MiniCL detector at Beijing Createch Testing Technology Co. Ltd. In-situ zircon Hf isotope analyses were completed on dated spots using an ESI NWR193 laser-ablation microprobe, attached to a Neptune plus multi-collector ICP-MS at CreaTech Testing International Co. Ltd in Beijing. Major and trace element analysis was carried out at the Analytical Center of the Beijing Institute of Geology for Nuclear Industry (ACBIGNI).\nPlease refer to the Appendix Text for details on the analytical methods.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nSeven Re-Os isotopic analysis of molybdenite samples are presented in Table 3\n. The geochronological data for five samples from the granitic phases in the Bilugangan Granite are presented in Fig. 6\n, Table 1 and Appendix Table 1. Five dated samples from the composite granite were also chosen for in-situ zircon Hf isotopic analyses at or near the U-Pb zircon dating spots, and the results are presented in Fig. 7\na, b, and listed in Table 1 and Appendix Table 2. Twelve samples were analysed for whole rock geochemistry and the results are listed in Table 1 and Appendix Table 3. The major geochemical results are calculated and plotted in Fig. 8\n after removing the loss on ignition (LOI) values in order to reduce the impact of post-magmatic alteration. The Sr-Nd isotopic analytical results for the samples from the Bilugangan Granite are given in Table 1 and Appendix Table 3.\n\n4.1\nMolybdenite Re-Os dating\nThe total Re assays of seven samples from the Mineralised Zone B are between 1758 and 88,435\u00a0ng\/g, and 187Os assays are between 4 and 219\u00a0ng\/g. The model ages range from 237\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 234\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma, yielding a weighted mean age of 236\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.28, n\u00a0=\u00a07), which is the same, within error, as the isochron age of 235\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.56, n\u00a0=\u00a07; Fig. 5. These dates are interpreted as the age of the molybdenite in Mineralised Zone B.\n\n\n4.2\nZircon U\u2013Pb dating\nZircons from the highly altered porphyritic granite (Sample ZK1252-1 of G1) are euhedral to subhedral crystals, and range from 80 to 200\u00a0\u03bcm in length with a length\/width ratios between 1:1 and 3:1. The cathodoluminescent (CL) images show that most of the zircons are magmatic in origin with clear oscillatory growth zoning (Fig. 6a. The Th\/U ratios of nine analyses range from 0.31 to 1.08, six of which yielded 206Pb\/238U ages ranging from 296\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 to 294\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 295\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.072; Fig. 6b. Given the low MSWD value, the date is regarded as inconclusive and could represent the age of xenocrystic zircons (similar to those observed in samples BL16-26 and ZK005-29 discussed below). Spot 11 from the sample yields a 207Pb\/206Pb date of 2723\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0Ma interpreted as the age of a xenocrystic zircon. Spots 10 and 20 from the sample yielded higher 206Pb\/238U dates of 420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma, which is also interpreted as the age of xenocrystic zircons.\nSample BL16-26 (G2) of the porphyritic monzogranite has 80\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcm long colourless subhedral or euhedral zircon crystals with length\/width ratios between 1.5:1 and 3:1 (Fig. 6c. The grains exhibit oscillatory growth zoning with Th\/U values of 0.34\u20132.50 indicative of a magmatic origin. Sixteen analyses of 20 zircons from Sample BL16-26 yield a 206Pb\/238U weighted mean age of 240\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.4; Fig. 6d, which is interpreted as the crystallisation age of the porphyritic monzogranite. Spots 4, 5, 18 and 23 have higher 206Pb\/238U dates ranging from 297\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 to 294\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 296\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.17), which are interpreted as the age of xenocrystic zircons.\nZircons extracted from Sample ZK005-29 (G3) of the fine- to medium-grained monzogranite range from 80 to 200\u00a0\u03bcm in length (Fig. 6e. The grains have Th\/U ratios of 0.15\u20131.41, and oscillatory growth zoning characteristic of a magmatic origin. Eight analyses on 20 zircons yield a weighted mean age of 235\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.79; Fig. 6f, which is taken as the crystallisation age of the fine- to medium-grained monzogranite. Spots 2, 6, 9, 11, 17, 20 and 22 have higher 206Pb\/238U dates ranging from 296\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 to 292\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 294\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.31) interpreted as the age of xenocrystic zircons. Spots 1, 3, 10, 12 and 14 have much higher 206Pb\/238U ages ranging from 418\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 416\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 417\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.021) also interpreted as the age of xenocrystic zircons.\nThe zircons from Sample ZK652-31 of medium -grained monzogranite (G4) range from 100 to 150\u00a0\u03bcm in length with Th\/U ratios of 0.53\u20131.05, and have very clear oscillatory growth zoning indicative of a magmatic origin (Fig. 6g. Twenty analyses on 20 zircons yield 206Pb\/238U ages of 231\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 to 228\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 230\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a00.15; Fig. 6h, which is interpreted as the crystallisation age of the fine- to medium-grained monzogranite.\nSample ZK963-1 of monzogranitic porphyry dyke (G5) has 80\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcm long zircon crystals with length\/width ratios between 1.5:1 and 3:1, and most are bright on cathodoluminescent images due to their low U assays of 150\u2013452\u00a0ppm and Th assays of 70\u2013406\u00a0ppm (Fig. 6i. Most of the zircons are euhedral to subhedral in shape and have obscure oscillatory growth zoning. The Th\/U ratios of these zircons range from 0.29 to 0.52 indicative of a magmatic origin, 11 analyses yielded 206Pb\/238U ages of 105\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 to 96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma with a weighted mean age of 100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0Ma (MSWD\u00a0=\u00a08.6; Fig. 6j, which is interpreted as the crystallisation age of the monzogranitic porphyry dyke. Four anhedral zircons (Spots 2, 7, 8 and 12) from Sample ZK963-1 have Th\/U values of 0.46\u20130.93, and yield 207Pb\/206Pb ages of 2718\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018 to 2587\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0Ma, which are interpreted as the ages of xenocrystic zircons.\n\n\n4.3\n\nIn-situ zircon Hf isotopic analysis\nTwo xenocrystic zircon from Sample ZK1252-1 of the altered granitic porphyry and Sample ZK963-1 of the monzogranitic porphyry dyke have \u03b5\nHf(2.7\u20132.6\u00a0Ga) values of 2.7\u20134.3 and two-stage depleted mantle Hf model (t\nDM2) ages between 2922 and 2921\u00a0Ma. Five xenocrystic zircons from Samples ZK1252-1 and ZK005-29 of the fine- to medium-grained monzogranite yield \u03b5\nHf(420\u2013417\u00a0Ma) values of \u22124.9 to \u22122.4 and t\nDM2 ages between 2922 and 2158\u00a0Ma. Six magmatic zircons from Sample ZK1252-1, and nine xenocrystic zircons from Sample BL16-26 of the porphyritic monzogranite and Sample ZK005-29 have highly varied \u03b5\nHf(296\u2013294\u00a0Ma) values between \u22123.6 and 11.9 with t\nDM2 ages from 1542 to 556\u00a0Ma. Sixteen magmatic zircons from Sample BL16-26 have \u03b5\nHf(ca. 240\u00a0Ma) values of 3.5 to 14.3 with t\nDM2 ages of 1051 \u2013 352\u00a0Ma. Four zircons have exceptionally low \u03b5\nHf(ca. 240\u00a0Ma) values of \u221216.4 to \u221210.1 with t\nDM2 ages of 2302\u20131911\u00a0Ma. Six magmatic zircons from Sample ZK005-29 have variable \u03b5\nHf(ca. 235\u00a0Ma) values between \u22124.5 and 7.9 with t\nDM2 ages between 1555 and 768\u00a0Ma. The magmatic zircons from G4 (Sample ZK652-31) have positive \u03b5\nHf(ca. 230\u00a0Ma) values of 3.5\u201312.1 and t\nDM2 ages of 1043\u2013493\u00a0Ma, and the magmatic zircons from Sample ZK963-1 (G5) have \u03b5\nHf(ca. 100\u00a0Ma) values of 4.2\u201314.3 with t\nDM2 ages of 894 \u2013 302\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n4.4\nMajor and trace element analysis\n\n4.4.1\nMajor elements\nThe phases of the Bilugangan Granite have similar geochemical compositions, and are characterised by high SiO2 assays of 70.96\u00a0\u223c\u00a075.50\u00a0wt% and K2O assays of 2.92\u00a0\u223c\u00a04.73\u00a0wt%. Most samples, except for porphyritic monzogranite (Samples BL16-12 and BL16-26), plot in the high-K field in Fig. 8a and are weakly peraluminous to metaluminous with A\/CNK values between 1.02 and 1.17 (Fig. 8b. The LOI values of Samples BL16-12 and BL16-26 are higher than 4\u00a0wt%, indicating that they have undergone significant post-magmatic alteration. Thus, the geochemical data of the two samples cannot be used to determine the geochemical characteristics of the non-altered porphyritic monzogranite.\n\n\n4.4.2\nTrace elements\nThe Chondrite normalised Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns for the phases in the Bilugangan Granite are enriched in light REEs (LREEs) with LREE\/HREE ratios of 18.8 for G1, 11.8\u201312.5 for G2, 14.5\u201315.5 for G3, 7.9\u201311.5 for G4, and 3.4\u20133.8 for G5 (Fig. 8c. The (La\/Yb)N values are 31 for G1, 15\u201318 for G2, 20\u201325 for G3, 8\u201319 for G4, and 2.7\u20132.9 for G5. All the samples are characterised by depleted Eu, with the Eu\/Eu* ratios being 0.8 for G1, 0.58\u20130.69 for G2, 0.54\u20130.59 for G3, 0.35\u20130.39 for G4, and 0.007\u20130.012 for G5.\nMost of the samples have uniform trace elements patterns in the primitive mantle-normalised trace element spider diagram (Fig. 8d. The samples are characteristically enriched in Rb, Th, U, K, Pb, Nd and Hf, and depleted in Ba, Nb, Ta, Ce, P and Ti. The granite porphyry dyke has pronounced Ba, P, Zr, and Ti negative anomalies. The calculated zircon saturation temperatures (TZr) are 777\u00b0C for G1, 778\u00b0 \u2212 812\u00b0C for G2, 754\u00b0 \u2212 761\u00b0C for G3, 727\u00b0 \u2212 744\u00b0C for G4, and 638\u00b0 \u2212 751\u00b0C for G5.\n\n\n\n4.5\nWhole rock Sr-Nd isotopic analysis\nThe calculated initial 87Sr\/86Sr ratios are 0.705869 for G1, 0.702665\u20130.703757 for G2, 0.706372\u20130.707912 for G3, 0.708887\u20130.710408 for G4, and 0.0.718806\u20130.723922 for G5. The \u03b5\nNd(t) values for G1 are \u22120.1 with two-stage depleted mantle Nd model (TDM2) ages of 1067\u00a0Ma, \u03b5\nNd(t) values for G2 are +1.3 to\u00a0+\u00a02.7 with TDM2 ages from 907 to 799\u00a0Ma , \u03b5\nNd(t) values of \u22121.9 to \u22121.3 with TDM2 ages from 1166 to 1113\u00a0Ma for G3, \u03b5\nNd(t) values of \u22121.0 to\u00a0+\u00a00.5 with TDM2 ages from 1086 to 969\u00a0Ma for G4, and \u03b5\nNd(t) values of\u00a0+\u00a05.0 to +5.1 with TDM2 ages from 493 to 481\u00a0Ma for G5.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nGeochronology of the granite and related Mo mineralisation at Bilugangan\nFive granitic phases have been recognised in the Bilugangan mine area and in diamond-drillholes. The granites range in age from 296 to 96\u00a0Ma recording two protracted magmatic lulls lasting around 52 and 123 million years. In addition, xenocrystic zircons yielding U-Pb dates of 420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0Ma for G1 and 417\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma for G3 point to the presence of Silurian to Early Devonian units at depth in the area.\nThe highly altered granitic porphyry (G1) represents the cupola of the Bilugangan Granite, which has been altered by the fluids originating from it, or from the later phases of intrusions. The ca. 242 \u2013 237\u00a0Ma magmatic activity represented by the G2 phase is exposed in the open pit mine and in diamond-drillholes in the Mineralised Zone A. New U\u2013Pb zircon ages obtained for this study are nearly identical to a SHRIMP zircon date of 241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0Ma (Liu et al., 2012b). These dates are also coeval with the Re-Os model dates of ca. 239\u2013237\u00a0Ma for molybdenite from Mineralised Zone A (Li et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019a).\nThe subsequent G3 event is ca. 236\u2013232\u00a0Ma represented by the fine- to medium-grained monzogranite in diamond-drillholes from Mineralised Zone B and C. The G2 and G3 phases are present in separate mineralised zones and are not seen in contact. Molybdenite samples from Mineralised Zone B yield Re-Os model ages varying between ca. 237 and 234\u00a0Ma, which are similar to the zircon dates for G3 showing they are coeval in Mineralised Zone B. Furthermore, both of the G2 and G3 phases are characterised by silicic-sericitic (-potassic) alteration with Mo-mineralisation at the contact with the hornfels. These observations pointed to a genetic association between the G2 and G3 phases with the Mo mineralisation at Bilugangan. The non-mineralised ca. 231\u2013228\u00a0Ma G4 phase at the bottom of diamond-drillholes at Mineralised zones A and B is associated with a weak sericitic-silicic-clay alteration interpreted as being younger than the Mo mineralisation, which would place the mineralised between ca. 239 and 234\u00a0Ma. The G5 phase is between ca. 105 and 96\u00a0Ma and represents the last magmatism in the Bilugangan area.\nThe geochronology documented here and elsewhere indicate that multiple magmatic events have been active around Bilugangan during the Early Permian to Early Cretaceous (Fig. 9\na, and the Mo mineralisation is constrained between the Middle to Late Triassic, which is included in the period between 248 and 235\u00a0Ma in the southern GXR (Fig. 9b; Zeng et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a).\n\n\n5.2\nDuration of magmatic-hydrothermal activity at Bilugangan\nThe duration of magmatism associated with mineralising hydrothermal fluids can extend from tens of thousands to millions of years (e.g. Li et al., 2013 and references therein). Studies have revealed that the timescale for each porphyry-type mineralising pulse can be shorter than 800,000\u00a0years based on numerical thermal modelling of the lifetime of upper-crustal magma chambers (Cathles et al., 1997; Weis et al., 2012). Another estimate is shorter than 600,000\u00a0years based on diffusion modelling of titanium gradients in different quartz generations (Mercer et al., 2015). High precision chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon studies also reveal that the porphyry deposits can develop in a period of 100,000\u00a0years (e.g. Von Quadt et al., 2011; Chelle-Michou et al., 2014; Tapster et al., 2016; Buret et al., 2016). Long-lived mineral-bearing hydrothermal activity spanning millions of years may formed by short-lived episodes of hydrofracturing, dyke emplacement, and stockwork venting with discrete thermal pulses repeated over millions of years (Cathles et al., 1997; Li et al., 2013; Mercer et al., 2015).\nIn this scenario, granitic emplacement, hydrothermal circulation and mineral deposition should be closely associated in time and space, thus the age of the granites should be the same as the age of molybdenite. It is therefore proposed that the Mo mineralisation at Bilugangan was deposited during short-lived magma-related hydrothermal during at least two magmatic-hydrothermal pulses represented by the ca. 239\u2013237\u00a0Ma hosted by G2 phase in Mineralised Zone A and the ca. 237\u2013234\u00a0Ma hosted by G3 phase in Mineralised Zone B resulting in the deposition of the large-scale Bilugangan Mo deposit.\n\n\n5.3\nPetrogenesis and source of the Bilugangan Granite\nIn general, the granitic phases in the Bilugangan Granite have high SiO2, alkali, and K2O contents, and low Mg content, indicating a negligible involvement of mantle-derived magma. Most whole rock samples are weakly peraluminous to metaluminous affinity, enriched in LREE and LILEs, and depleted in HFSEs with moderate negative Eu anomalies (Eu\/Eu* =0.35\u20130.8). These features are commonly found in crust-derived rocks such as the granitoids of the Lachlan Fold Belt (Chappell and White, 1992). In addition, the Nb\/Ta ratios for the Bilugangan granites vary between 5.3 and 14.7, also indicating their crustal melt origin (Green, 1995). This interpretation is suggested by a large range of \u03b5\nHf(297\u2013293\u00a0Ma) values of \u22123.6 to 11.9 for six xenocrystic zircons from the G1 granitic phase and nine xenocrystic zircons from G2 and G3 phases. The positive \u03b5\nHf(297\u2013294\u00a0Ma) values of 3.9\u201311.9 with two-stage depleted mantle Hf model ages (t\nDM2) ranging from 1066 to 556\u00a0Ma for the G1 to G2 phases are indicative of a juvenile crustal source (derived from depleted mantle during the Meso- to Neoproterozoic). Early to Middle Mesoproterozoic crustal components in the source of the magma are also implicated based on their relatively negative \u03b5\nHf(296\u2013293\u00a0Ma) values of \u22123.6 to 1.1 with t\nDM2 dates of ca. 1542 to 1244\u00a0Ma.\nAll the \u03b5\nNd(t) and (87Sr\/86Sr)i values for the G2, G3 and G4 samples plot in the Mesozoic granitic rock domain of southern GXR, as defined by Guo et al. (2010) in Fig. 10\n. However, the parental magma for the G2 and G3 phases are much more complex than that of the G4 phase as indicated by the Hf isotopic data. The source of the G4 phase is derived from a single and homogeneous Neoproterozoic protolith with a narrower and similar positive \u03b5\nHf(231\u2013228\u00a0Ma) values of 4.2 to 12.1, similar Nd two model (TDM2) ages of ca. 1086\u2013969\u00a0Ma, and Hf two model (t\nDM2) ages of 1043\u2013493\u00a0Ma. In contrast, the G2 and G3 phases have highly varied \u03b5\nHf(242\u2013237\u00a0Ma) values of \u221216.4\u201314.3 for G2 and \u03b5\nHf(238\u2013233\u00a0Ma) values of \u22124.5\u20137.9 for G3. The largely positive \u03b5\nHf(242\u2013237\u00a0Ma) values of 3.5 to 14.3 for G2 and \u03b5\nHf(238\u2013233\u00a0Ma) values of 4.0\u20137.9 for G3 show that the source of the magma of the granitic phases are derived from depleted mantle during the Late Mesoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous with Hf two model (t\nDM2) ages of 1051\u2013352\u00a0Ma for G2 and 1021\u2013768\u00a0Ma for G3. The negative \u03b5\nHf(236\u2013235\u00a0Ma) values of \u22124.5 to \u22121.3 for G3 suggest involvement of Early to Middle Mesoproterozoic lower crust with Hf two model (t\nDM2) ages between 1555 and 1350\u00a0Ma. The G2 phase has large negative \u03b5\nHf(242\u2013238\u00a0Ma) range of \u221216.4 to \u221210.1 with t\nDM2 ages between ca. 2302 and 1911\u00a0Ma, further supporting incorporation of older (Palaeoproterozoic) crustal components derived from depleted mantle. Furthermore, the presence or older xenocrystic zircon from G1 and G5 show that the source has older components dated between ca. 2723\u20132587\u00a0Ma, coeval with gneisses in the North China Block (e.g. Bagas et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021). The Halatu Granite located almost 100\u00a0km to the southwest of Bilugangan yields a SHRIMP zircon age of 234\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 with a large variation in \u03b5\nHf(t) values between \u221226\u20139.1 and t\nDM2 ages between 4042 and 600\u00a0Ma, showing that Precambrian sources for Triassic granites are widespread in the region (Chen et al., 2009). This places an interesting question on how far Archaean units extend at depth northwards from the North China Block.\nThe G5 phase have an overall flat normalised REE pattern with large negative Eu anomalies with Eu\/Eu* values of 0.007\u20130.012, which is characteristic of the REE tetrad effects documented for highly evolved granitic rocks. The tetrad effect is also indicative of a highly differentiated felsic magma interacted with the coexisting volatile-rich fluid during the late stages in the evolution of the parental magma (c.f. Jahn et al., 2001, Zhao et al., 2002, Wu et al., 2004; Jiang, et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019b). The combined \u03b5\nNd(t) values of 5.0\u20135.1 and \u03b5\nHf(105\u201396\u00a0Ma) values of 4.2\u20132.7, with TDM2 ages of ca. 493\u2013481\u00a0Ma and t\nDM2 ages of 894\u2013350\u00a0Ma, are indicative of Neoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous sources for G5 originating from a depleted mantle. The initial Sr isotopic composition of the granite may be difficult to measure accurately considering fractional crystallisation has taken place (Chappell et al., 1998; Jahn et al., 2001, 2004; Wu et al., 2004). The highly evolved G5 phase has a low Sr content of 40\u201368\u00a0ppm, with a calculated (87Sr\/86Sr)i value of 071881\u20130.72392, but these values are not accurate due to the low Sr assays and cannot be used to constrain its paragenesis (Fig. 10.\nFurthermore, the unexposed wall rock inferred from the ca. 420\u2013417\u00a0Ma xenocrystic zircons in the G1 and G3 phases have \u03b5\nHf(420\u2013417\u00a0Ma) values of \u22124.9 to \u22122.4 with t\nDM2 ages of ca. 1700\u20131600\u00a0Ma (indicative of a Late Palaeoproterozoic to Early Mesoproterozoc source). The 2700\u20132600\u00a0Ma xenocrystic zircons from the G1 and G5 phases also have positive \u03b5\nHf(2.7\u20132.6\u00a0Ga) values of 2.7 to 4.3.\nIn light of the (87Sr\/86Sr)i, \u03b5\nNd(t) and \u03b5\nHf(t) values, and two-stage depleted mantle Nd and Hf model ages discussed above, we suggest that the Bilugangan Granite formed by partial melting of two or more sources although magma mixing has produces similar Sr and Nd isotopic compositions. The protoliths of the G1 to G5 phases include a dominant juvenile lower crustal component indicated by the whole rock \u03b5\nNd(t) values of \u22121.9 to 5.1 and large variations in the zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) values of 3.5\u201314.3 with TDM2 and t\nDM2 ages of 1086\u2013350\u00a0Ma. The \u03b5Hf(t) vs t diagram in Fig. 7a shows that the samples plot between the depleted mantle and ca. 1000\u00a0Ma crust evolution line, recording juvenile crustal growth from the Neoproterozoic.\nThe source for the Bilugangan Granite also includes subordinate Precambrian continental crust with negative \u03b5\nHf(t) values. The source can be further divided into two components. One has \u03b5\nHf(296\u2013235\u00a0Ma) values of \u22124.5 to 1.1 and t\nDM2 ages of 1600\u20131200\u00a0Ma, which plotted between the 1800 and 1000\u00a0Ma crust evolution lines in Fig. 7(a, b). The other component is represented by the ca. 2700 and 2600\u00a0Ma xenocrystic zircons and ca. 242\u2013238\u00a0Ma magmatic zircons. These zircons have large negative \u03b5\nHf(242\u2013238\u00a0Ma) values of \u221216.4 to \u221210.1 with t\nDM2 ages of 2300\u20131900\u00a0Ma that plotted between the 2500 and 1800\u00a0Ma crustal evolution lines (Fig. 7a-c.\n\n\n5.4\nNew evidence for Precambrian rocks in the southern Great Xing'an range\nIt is commonly accepted that the CAO is a huge and complex accretionary collage containing voluminous Phanerozoic juvenile crustal growth characterised by a large number of positive whole-rock \u03b5\nNd(t) values (e.g. Seng\u00f6r et al., 1993; Jahn et al., 2000a; Jahn et al., 2000b; Hong et al., 2004; Windley et al., 2007). Kr\u00f6ner et al. (2014), Kr\u00f6ner et al. (2017) recently reassessed the continental growth of the orogen during its accretion and argues that the production of juvenile continental crust had been grossly overestimated. New field observations and isotopic data have been provided indicating that the volume of truly juvenile crustal material accounts for\u00a0\u223c\u00a020%, instead of the excessive (50%) of crustal growth proposed by Seng\u00f6r et al. (1993).\nThe reason for this reassessment of the CAO includes: (1) extension of the timing of the deformation by around 800\u00a0Ma starting with the opening of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean at ca. 1020\u00a0Ma and its closure during the Early Permian corresponding to the reduction of juvenile crust by 270 million years (Khain et al., 2003; Kuzmichev and Larionov, 2013); (2) the significant variation in zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) values shows that many magmas in the orogen were assembled through mixing of juvenile magma with old crustal material, which is supported by the Precambrian xenocrystic zircons in magmatic rocks, rather than purely juvenile crust based on the whole-rock Nd isotopic systematic studies (e.g. Kovach et al., 2011; Kr\u00f6ner et al., 2014; 2017 and references therein); and (3) the recognition of Precambrian crustal mantle lithosphere in the orogen (Wang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015a).\nStrongly deformed and metamorphosed Late Mesoproterozoic supracrustal and Neoproterozoic mafic to ultramafic rocks are sporadically exposed in the southern GXR from the Xilingol (or Xilinhot) Complex between Erlianhot in the west through Sonid Left Banner to the Xilinhot and Xi Ujimqi areas in the east (BGMR-IMAR, 1991; Shao, 1991; Li and Gao, 1995; Xiao et al., 2003; Shao et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013; Zhou and Ge, 2013; Xu et al., 2015). The age of the Xilinhot Complex has long been a matter of discussion with one view regarding the complex as being Palaeoproterozoic in age, based on geological mapping and imprecise Rb-Sr isochron dates of ca. 1900\u20131700\u00a0Ma (BGMR-IMAR, 1991; Li and Gao, 1995; Xiao et al., 1995). A second theory regards the complex as being Meso- to Neoproterozoic in age based on Sm-Nd isochron dates of 1511\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076\u00a0Ma for an actinolite schist around Sonid Left Banner and ca. 1286\u20131025\u00a0Ma for amphibolite in the Xilinhot area (Xu et al., 1994; Xu et al., 1996; Hao and Xu, 1997). A third theory proposes the complex as being an Early Paleozoic forearc accretionary prism with minor oceanic crustal components, based on the dates of detrital zircons from paragneiss near the Xilinhot area with age populations between ca. 3141 and 837\u00a0Ma and between ca. 494 and 419\u00a0Ma (Fig. 1c; Shi et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009; Jian et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). Recent zircon U-Pb dates ranging from ca. 1516 to 1360\u00a0Ma for orthogneiss outcropped south of the Sonid Left and Abaga banners provide new evidence supporting that the Mesoproterozoic age of that part of the Xilingol Complex (Fig. 1c; Sun et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2018a; Sun et al., 2020; Han et al., 2017). This interpretation is also supported by the widespread zircon \u03b5\nHf(445\u2013439\u00a0Ma) values between \u22124.7 and 9.2 with TDM2 ages of ca. 1724\u2013835\u00a0Ma typical of arc-related volcanic rocks. The Halatu Granite south of the Sonid Left Banner has \u03b5\nHf(234\u00a0Ma) values of \u221226 to 12 corresponding to two sources with TDM2 dates of ca. 2900\u20131524 and 900\u2013780\u00a0Ma (Fig. 1c and 7a; Chen et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2016).\n\nIn addition to the xenocrystic ca. 2700\u20132600\u00a0Ma zircons dated in this study from the Bilugangan Granite with negative \u03b5\nHf(242\u2013238\u00a0Ma) values of \u221216.4 to \u221210.1 and t\nDM2 ages of 2300\u20131900\u00a0Ma), the positive zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) values of 3.5\u201314.3 and t\nDM2 ages of 1086\u2013350\u00a0Ma from the granite also record a Neoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous juvenile continental crustal source. This was synchronous with the evolution of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean. In addition, the predominantly negative \u03b5\nHf(296\u2013235\u00a0Ma) values of \u22124.5 \u2013 1.1 with t\nDM2 ages of 1600\u20131200\u00a0Ma further strengthen the interpretation that Mesoproterozoic (pre-CAO) rocks are present in southern GXR (Sun et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2018a; Sun et al., 2020; Han et al., 2017).\n\n\n5.5\nContinental crustal source for the Bilugangan Granite and related Mo mineralisation\nIt is proposed that Mo mineralisation is intimately related to the mature continental crust according to the closely spatial relationship between the continental crust and Mo mineralisation: Numerous porphyry Mo deposits, especially Mo-only and Mo-dominant polymetallic deposits, are underlain by the mature continental crust in tectonic settings including back-arc or intracontinental rifts, and the collisional orogeny; in contrast, an island arc setting with limited continental crust is not favourable for Mo mineralisation (Misra, 2000; Chen et al., 2017b; Zhang and Li, 2017). The close spatial relationship between continental crust, granites and related Mo mineralisation in the CAO lead us to propose that the continental crust is the source of the mineralisation at Bilugangan. These observations are also supported by the variable Hf isotopic compositions in composite intrusions, such as the Bilugangan Granite that includes the pre- to syn-ore G1-3 phases and post-ore G4 and G5 phases. The syn-ore phases have a more complex source with distinctly \u03b5\nHf(t) values characteristic of crustal sources for their magma (the details are discussed above).\nIn addition, we have integrated our whole-rock Nd and zircon Hf data from the Bilugangan Granite with that of 24 other porphyry deposits in northeastern China, which shows that there is a generally positive correlation between the \u03b5\nNd(t) or \u03b5\nHf(t) values and Mo\/Cu ratios where the Mo-dominant porphyry deposits have negative \u03b5\nNd(t) or \u03b5\nHf(t) values (Fig. 11\n; Table 4\n. Examples are the Sadaigoumen, Dasuji, Caosiyao, Bilugangan and Chalukou deposits with both negative \u03b5\nNd(t) and \u03b5\nHf(t) ratios characteristic of a continental crustal source (Jiang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017; Zhang and Li, 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a). Other examples include the Chaganhua, Xingwen, Jiguanshan, Huojihe, Luming, Daheishan and Haisugou deposits, which have \u03b5\nNd(t) or \u03b5\nHf(t) values indicating the presence of crustal contamination in the parental magma (Liu, 2013; Lai et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014, 2019; Shu et al., 2014, 2016; Zhou et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2018a; Zheng and Yu, 2017; Zeng et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020). In contrast, almost all of the Cu-dominant porphyry deposits have positive \u03b5\nNd(t) and \u03b5\nHf(t) values indicative of a relatively juvenile source for the copper\u2019s parental magma, including the Duobaoshan, Yanghuidongzi and Naoniushan deposits (Liu et al., 2012a; L\u00fc et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2018; Ma, 2020). The Mo-Cu and Cu-Mo types of deposits, such as the Wurinitu, Aolunhua and Xing\u2019a Mo-Cu type, and Badaguan, Laojiagou and Wunugetushan Cu-Mo type, generally have similar \u03b5\nNd(t) or \u03b5\nHf(t) values (Ma et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011b; Bai and Zhang, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang, 2015; Duan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b; Gao et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2016, 2018; Mi et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe NE-trending and sporadically exposed composite Bilugangan Granite consists of monzogranitic phases (G1 to G5) at the large-sized Bilugangan porphyry Mo deposit. The associated Mo mineralisation includes is hosted by the G2 and G3 phases and adjoining hornfels. Zircon U-Pb and molybdenite Re-Os dates from the study area define multiple magmatic events during the emplacement of the composite granite during the Early Permian to Early Cretaceous, with the significant Mo related magmatism at ca. 242\u2013228\u00a0Ma during the Triassic. Magma-related hydrothermal activity took place during ca. 239\u2013237\u00a0Ma in the Mineralised Zone A and ca. 237\u2013234\u00a0Ma in the Mineralised Zone B at the deposit. This defines a mineralising event synchronous with the host granitic phases over a period of around 5 million years.\nOur Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic systematics indicate that the Bilugangan Granite is the product of the partial melts from at least two sources including: (i) a Neoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous lower crust with \u03b5\nNd(t) values between \u22121.9 and\u00a0+\u00a05.1, and zircon \u03b5\nHf(t) values ranging from\u00a0+\u00a03.5 to\u00a0+\u00a014.3 with TDM2 and t\nDM2 ages of 1086\u2013350\u00a0Ma, which probably relate to the evolution of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean; and (ii) Archaean to Mesoproterozoic continental crust. The Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic component is indicted by ca. 2700\u20132600\u00a0Ma xenocrystic zircons with negative \u03b5\nHf(t) values between \u221216.4 and \u221210.1, and t\nDM2 ages of ca. 2300 to 1900\u00a0Ma. The Mesoproterozoic crustal source has \u03b5\nHf(t) values between \u22124.5 and\u00a0+\u00a01.1, and t\nDM2 ages of ca. 1600\u20131200\u00a0Ma. These data show \u2018pre-CAO\u2019 crust existed in the southern Great Xing'an Range, and suggest the incorporation of old crustal components in the parental magma, which is critical for the genesis of the Mo mineralisation.\n\n","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":""},"Creator":{"0":["Ni,

upstream oil and gas industry, which has been the subject of numerous studies during the last two decades. Although the role of geomechanical parameters has rarely been considered in these studies. Therefore, this study aimed to optimize the controllable drilling parameters using a novel geomechanics-based workflow. For this purpose, data for 4229\u00a0m drilling from 4 wells located in one of the oil fields in southwestern Iran were studied. A 1D geomechanical model was developed for each well following the data pre-processing. In the feature selection stage, using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) integrated by the artificial neural network with multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP), bit diameter (BS), equivalent circulating density (ECD), weight on bit (WOB), revolution per minute (RPM), flow pump rate (FPR), depth (Depth), formation resistivity (RT), static Young's modulus (E), and minimum horizontal stress (Sh) were selected to develop intelligent prediction models for drilling rate of penetration (ROP) and torque (TRQ), so two models ROP and TRQ were then developed using ANN-MLP. Subsequently, the coupling of ROP, TRQ, and mechanical specific energy (MSE) models and the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm were performed to achieve the best controllable parameters including WOB, RPM, and FPR at any depth (real-time), so that ROP was maximized and TRQ and MSE were minimized. Then, the optimal parameters for each formation thickness, 50\u00a0m and 100\u00a0m intervals were presented. In addition, the scenario of the set of optimal parameters for each geomechanical unit (GMU) was provided for the first time. Finally, the drilling performance results obtained from the two optimization techniques based on geomechanics and best practices were compared to each other. According to the results, the application of optimal parameters obtained from the best practices significantly leads to a doubling of mechanical specific energy. However, the application of geomechanics-based optimization technique with different scenarios successfully improved the performance of drilling operations; so that in the real-time scenario, the drilling time by 62%, 82%, 56%, and 68% and the MSE by averagely 7%, 29%, 11%, and 15% were reduced for wells A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, the application of scenarios of GMUs, formation thickness, and 50\u00a0m and 100\u00a0m intervals had the best performance, respectively. Therefore, the application of geomechanics-based drilling optimization for carbonate formations within the studied parameter ranges is strongly recommended according to the information range in this study.\n               ","1":"\n                  Deep learning algorithms have shown great potential in geophysical areas such as seismic interpretation and seismic inversion. However, when applied to seismic inversion, high dependence on label data amount and lack of geophysical constraints severely influences the feasibility and accuracy of results predicted by deep learning-based methods. To address these two problems, we design an improved cycle-consistency generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) to mitigate the dependence on labeled data amount. Only a small amount of label data (less than 1%) can render high accuracy of predict results with this method, eliminating the need for an initial model. Besides, novel geophysical constraints are added to the network. Firstly, the deterministic inversion results and labeled data are substituted into hybrid-geophysical data as a training set. Then the residuals between field data and synthetic seismic data are used as part of the loss function to make the predicted results meet the geophysical laws. The geophysical inconsistency factor is introduced as an index to quantitatively evaluate the consistency between synthetic seismic data and field data. The Marmousi model test results prove that this method significantly improves the prediction accuracy and the matching degree of synthetic seismic data compared with other methods such as Cycle-GAN and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We apply this method to field data, and the prediction results show that the predicted impedance of this proposed method is highly correlated with the real impedance.\n               ","2":"\n                  Asphaltene molecules are one of the main sub-fractions of heavy crude oils. During matrix acidizing operation, these polar molecules are highly susceptible to interact with acid and form a third phase called asphaltic sludge. Deposition of the formed sludge on the rock surface and plugging their pore throats alters the rock wettability state and consequently its permeability. In the present study, the impact of acid and oil on the volume of the formed sludge as well as on the wettability of three rock types including sandstone, fractured and vuggy carbonate rocks were experimentally explored. A new environmentally friendly bio-surfactant which is extracted from Zizyphus spina-christ shrub (ZSCS) leaves was used as an inhibitor to control the potential damage causing by wettability alteration and the following pore plugging. Two common commercial additives were also evaluated against the bio surfactant performance that was used in this study. As a complementary step, molecular dynamic simulations were also conducted firstly to shed the light on the affinities between asphaltene and acid molecules and then check how the presence of ZSCS intervene the interaction between asphaltene molecules and rock surface. Our findings prove that using ZSCS provides optimal solution concerning production issues (i.e., Prevention of acid-induced sludge formation), both economically and environmentally; economically as it simply costs less than other commonly used chemicals, and environmentally as it extracted from nature.\n               ","3":"\n                  Al-Baraka is the first explored oil field in the Komombo basin. The formation and evolution of Komombo basin were influenced by tectonic processes from the pre-early Cretaceous period. The main objectives of this study are to; identify hydrocarbon potential in this remote part of Egypt, evaluate and determine the interesting zones within the early cretaceous rocks for hydrocarbon accumulations in Al-Baraka reservoir. Using well logging data, the stratigraphic section and reservoir extent of Al-Baraka field were examined. Three-dimensional geometrical and structural models were also created using seismic reflection data. Al-Baraka reservoir rocks are made up of non-marine sands and shales that were accumulated in a confined marine environment. By the careful interpretation of petrophysical data, different hydrocarbon-bearing zones (R2, R4, and R5) can be identified within west Al-Baraka-2 well. These zones were recognized in the Six Hills Formation members E and F of the early Cretaceous. Petrophysical analyses showed that these zones have moderate to good porosity (18.2\u201320.1%), low shale distribution (8.5\u201320%), and high average hydrocarbon saturation (42.5%) with high movability. Five zones were recognized based on the interpretation of 3D geometrical modeling. 3D structural modeling shows lateral extension and thickness variation controlled by the effect of faulting. The exploration of hydrocarbon in Komombo basin will contribute to the exploration of more rift basins in southern Egypt.\n               ","4":"\n                  Lower Paleozoic source rock (SR) characteristics and paleo-depositional environments are not well understood in the Barents Sea region. Organic and inorganic geochemical analyses of 17 carbonaceous samples from the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation, the Lower to Middle Ordovician Kirtonryggen and Valhallfonna formations in Ny Friesland, north-east Spitsbergen, show that there is a striking difference in petroleum generation potential and bulk geochemical properties between the Cambrian and Ordovician samples, and also within the Ordovician samples. TOC contents of <0.20\u00a0wt% for the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation samples indicate poor source rock richness. TOC contents in the range between 0.3 and 2.1\u00a0wt% and HI values between 123 and 424\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC for the Valhallfonna and Kirtonryggen formation samples suggest significant variation in remaining petroleum generation potential with oil-prone (Type II) to mixed oil- and gas-prone (Type II\/III) kerogen. Source rock maturity parameters such as T\n                        max\n                      (range 435\u2013449\u00a0\u00b0C) and production indices for most Ordovician samples suggest relatively uniform maturity levels, ranging from the early-, to the peak-, of the oil generation window (i.e. ca. 0.70\u20130.85% Ro). This maturity level could have significant implication on the original petroleum potential assuming early generation from carbonate source rocks. Bulk carbon isotope data show that the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation samples are heavier (\u03b4\n                     13C range from \u221228.4 to \u221228.8\u2030) than the Lower to Middle Ordovician Valhallfonna Formation samples (\u03b4\n                     13C range from \u221229.7 to \u221230.9\u2030). The differences in the source rock richness and kerogen type within the Ordovician samples are attributed to organic facies variation. Tentatively, three categories of source rock organic facies (B, BC and C) are supported based on assumed-initial hydrogen index values for the Ordovician samples. The reliability of the indicated organic facies could be supported by addition of biomarker data from bitumen extracts. To our knowledge, this is the first study revealing the existence of a potential Lower Paleozoic source rocks in this part of the High Arctic, and this facies may also exist on the continental shelf to the north and NE.\n               ","5":"\n                  In this paper, the expandable packer rubber with nylon 66 cord was selected as research object. By carrying out a single pull-out experiment of nylon 66 cord rubber, it was gotten that the critical failure energy of the adhesive interface between the cord and the rubber matrix was 3.21\u00a0kJ\/m2. The Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) was used to describe the bonding state of interface between nylon cord and rubber matrix and the debonding failure criterion was then established for the adhesive interface between nylon 66 cord and rubber matrix. The mechanical properties and working performance were analyzed systematically for the expandable packer rubber under different pressures and well temperatures. The results showed that:1) When the fracturing pump pressure was 50\u00a0MPa\u223c80\u00a0MPa, the shear stress of the packer rubber matrix was less than the allowable shear stress of 17.5\u00a0MPa, and the matrix didn't appear shear tearing damage. So the packer rubber filled with nylon cord could effectively protect the rubber matrix and avoid shear tear damage. 2) When the fracturing pump pressure was 80\u00a0MPa, the interface failure energy of the lower rubber was greater than the critical failure energy of 3.21\u00a0kJ\/m2, and the interface debonding failure occurred between cord and matrix. 3) When the well temperature was 25\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013175\u00a0\u00b0C, the shear stress of the rubber matrix increased with the increase of well temperature, but he maximum shear stress of the matrix was less than the allowable shear stress of 17.5\u00a0MPa. The failure energy of the adhesive interface was less than the critical failure energy of 3.21\u00a0kJ\/m2. So there was no shear tear on the matrix of the rubber and the adhesive interface was well bonded. Therefore, the expandable packer rubber with nylon 66 cord could work well in a higher well temperature environment. It is concluded that the research results can provide theoretical guidance for exploring the performance of the expandable packer rubber with nylon cord.\n               ","6":"\n                  The purpose of utilizing hybrid nanofluids is to improve the heat transfer rate of the base fluid. An electromagnetically conducting flow of zinc-oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes suspension submerged in engine oil is explored on a biaxially, planarly, and perpendicularly stretching\/shrinking surface. Dual solutions, as well as linear stability of the considered problem are studied. The energy transport analysis includes the impact of thermal radiation, heat source\/sink, and Ohmic heating. In addition, similarity ansatzes are used to develop ordinary differential equations. Bvp4c technique in Matlab is applied to find the numerical solutions. It is perceived that the magnetic field's motional electromagnetic force drives the system's energy transfer rate to rise, while velocities drop causing an increment in skin friction. Moreover, the stretching parameter along the x-axis gives an increasing behavior of velocity field for the first solution; however, it declines for the second solution. It is noted that radiation causes thermal transport to exalt. Moreover, the frictional drag along the x-axis is inclined due to an increment in stretching parameters but declines along the y-axis.\n               ","7":"\n                  Despite the crucial role of the variability of pore type across a rock unit in determining the outputs of the corresponding rock physics model, existing models are known to consider a limited number of pore types. Expectedly, relatively high levels of uncertainty associated with such models have been reported in recent studies on some carbonate reservoirs. In this research, I proposed a modification to conventional rock physics models for carbonate rocks, where different pore types can be adequately addressed by means of an intelligent approach. For this purpose, I integrated a pore type classification scheme for carbonate rocks into a pattern recognition technique to come up with a comprehensive rock physics model that can accommodate so many (virtually unlimited) different pore types: multi-pore rock physics model (MP-RPM). Beginning by extending the porosity term of the Xu and White's rock physics model to a multi-pore-type domain, the proposed model estimated the pore geometry based on digital image analysis of images acquired from thin sections. The pore geometry herein refers to pore type and aspect ratio, which were obtained by implementing a multi-class classifier algorithm. As a reference, the pore geometry was further assessed by an expert geologist who developed a pore geometry catalog (reference database). A case study was performed by applying the modified model to a carbonate reservoir to estimate the P- and S-wave velocities, with the results compared with those of the conventional model as well as measured values. Results showed that, compared to the conventional model, the proposed modification provided for a better correlation to the ultrasonic and measured well-logging data. The most significant advantage of the proposed modification was the elimination of the restrictions on the different pore types that can be addressed appropriately, making the modified model able to capture the reality of sedimentary facies even more closely.\n               ","8":"\n                  Growing evidence indicates that wellbore in hydrocarbon reservoirs exhibits an anisotropic shape. In this study, the dual strength and toughness criterion is used to study the fracture initiation characteristics from oval wellbores subject to a far-field stress field. First, a critical value of the ellipse shape factor, defined as the length ratio between the difference over the summation of the two semi-axes, is derived under the condition that the fracture nucleation site is random on the oval circumference and the corresponding initiation pressure is solely dependent on the remote mean stress and the tensile strength. If we specified the length of the semi-minor axis, the results show that the critical ellipse shape factor at a given stress field can be used to divide the borehole shapes into two classes based on the fracture nucleation site. If the elliptical wellbore is enclosed inside the critical ellipse, the fracture is initiated along with the maximum principal stress; otherwise, the fracture is initiated along the wellbore elongation direction perpendicular to the maximum principal stress. Moreover, the initiation pressure and fracture nucleation size show completely different varying trends between these two cases. Next, the fracture initiation for an ellipse-like wellbore shape, modified by an exponent from the ellipse, is considered. Of interest, for the ellipse-like wellbore outside its counterpart ellipse, the fracture nucleates in an inclined direction within one quadrant circumference and the four nucleated fractures exhibit an X-shape. As the semi-axis lengths are fixed, with increasing the exponent, the nucleation site renders an asymptotic angle determined by two semi-axis lengths. With an increase of the remote stress ratio, when the ellipse-like wellbore is enclosed inside an ellipse, the fracture nucleation site tends to align with the principal stresses, and otherwise, it shifts clock-wisely within a narrow range.\n               ","9":"\n                  Over the last decade, giant hydrocarbon reservoirs were discovered in lacustrine (Barremian-Aptian) and lagoonal (Aptian) carbonate reservoir systems, under Aptian evaporites, in the Santos and Campos basins. These pre-salt carbonate reservoirs contributed to placing Brazil among the world's top ten petroleum producers, and intense scientific interest has arisen to improve the characterization and understanding of these formations. The study of outcrop analogs is one of the most common techniques employed for such a goal. Several studies have pointed out that the Lagoa Salgada stromatolites are a potential analog of one of the important reservoir facies of pre-salt rocks. In this work, we used Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) data obtained on these stromatolites for evaluating porosity, pore size distribution, surface area, tortuosity, permeability, and pore compressibility. These results provided insight into the pore system of these rocks and allowed a comparison to pre-salt reservoir data. This comparison highlighted that such permo-porosity and pore compressibility behaviors of two facies of these outcrop rocks are analogous to the Brazilian pre-salt stromatolites.\n               ","10":"\n                  Cyclic steam injection, electric heating and air injection are commonly used as enhanced oil recovery method for heavy oil production. Previous studies have found that oil production rates decrease with the number of steam injection cycles. In this study, the potential of three hybrid thermal recovery processes: air assisted steam injection, electric heating assisted air injection and cyclic steam injection was investigated. Different hybrid thermal injection scenarios were simulated to examine the production performance of heavy oil reservoirs. The results revealed that air-assisted steam injection outperforms other approaches. It was observed that the cyclic steam with air injection obtained the highest oil recovery, while electric heating combined with cyclic air injection yielded the lowest oil recovery. The key factors controlling heavy oil production performance are the size and temperature of the heated chamber. As there are no conclusive remarks regarding the geomechanical effect on well deliverability, thermally induced geomechanical effect in the hybrid injection process was considered in this study. The behavior of cyclic injection and production causes the redistribution of in situ stresses. The geomechanical displacement was influenced by the injected steam and air volume. It was clearly observed that the reservoir vertical uplift occurred in the injection period which was caused by thermal injection.\n               ","11":"\n                  The use of foam technology in Pre-Salt reservoirs is a potential solution to control gas mobility in highly heterogeneous reservoirs. However, achieving stable CO2-foams under reservoir conditions can be challenging since high solubility in water of supercritical CO2 enhances coarsening and coalescence of bubbles. Coarsening is the evolution of foam structure with time due to gas diffusion between bubbles. In this phenomenon, gas normally diffuses from smaller to larger bubbles, which for confined foam is relevant because this ends up decreasing the number of bubbles in a determined area\/volume of the pore space (foam texture). When foam texture coarsens, gas mobility control is impaired, and it can also affect foam rheology. Therefore, it is important to characterize bubble growth kinetics to compare strategies to reduce coarsening and investigate their impact on gas mobility reduction due to foam injection. In a previous work, we reported the use of nanoparticles and a CO2\/N2 gas mixture as strategies for improving gas mobility of CO2-foams formed with a zwitterionic surfactant in a micromodel experiment. The present study focuses on quantitatively assessing the bubble growth regime related to coarsening for these two strategies. Indeed, bubble growth is a key parameter for population balance mathematical models that simulate CO2-foams in porous media. Image analysis was used to characterize the foam texture by calculating the bubble density and bubble size distribution of the foam confined in dead-end pores areas of the micromodel. Our results showed that, the number of trapped bubbles was twice as high for the foam formed with the gas mixture compared to those containing nanoparticles, and this higher bubble density was correlated with the higher pressure drop observed for this system, indicating lower gas mobility. The coarsening rates obtained by analyzing the change in trapped bubble area with time of CO2-foam containing nanoparticles (0.25\u00a0\u03bcm2\u00a0s\u22121) was in the same order of magnitude compared to that obtained by a CO2\/N2 gas mixture-foam (0.44\u00a0\u03bcm2\u00a0s\u22121), under the same high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. These results meant that both strategies were able to stabilize the weak foam formed between zwitterionic surfactant and CO2, and that the initial foam texture determined resistance to flow. The semi-automatic algorithm successfully identified the bubbles trapped within the system during the period of analysis, which allowed us not to add dyes that could change interfacial behavior at the water-gas interface. The novel results that evaluate the coarsening rate for CO2-foam under HPHT conditions can positively impact the estimation of foam destruction parameters for population balance models for more representative reservoir conditions of trapped gas. Our findings fill part of the gap in terms of evaluation of coarsening rate under more representative reservoir conditions, improving the understanding of kinetics of foam destruction. This information is relevant for establishing a correct range of the destruction term for populational balance models. Moreover, our results reveal that the type of strategy chosen to delay coarsening can significantly impact gas mobility reduction and that using nanoparticles impacted significantly interfacial properties of the formed foam.\n               ","12":"\n                  Proppants are often used in hydraulic fracturing to prevent fracture closure. However, there are few studies on the mechanism of proppant placement on the conductivity of fully supported fractures and the stress sensitivity of the conductivity under cyclic loading by using shale split cores. In this study, the Brazilian splitting method was used to simulate the reservoir fractures after hydraulic fracturing in the cylindrical shale cores of Shengli Oilfield. Then, different types of proppants with different particle sizes and fluids with different viscosity were selected to test the stress sensitivity and conductivity of fully supported fractures under cyclic loading. The results reveal that the selection of proppants with a large particle size and the adoption of the sand paving method with a high particle concentration will increase the conductivity of fractures. In the experimental test range, the fracture conductivity of 40\u201360 mesh quartz sand was one order of magnitude higher than that of 60\u2013100 mesh quartz sand. The fracture conductivity of the two magnitude orders was higher than that of 100\u2013200 mesh quartz sand. The conductivity of the large-sized proppant placed at the front end of fractures was 6.21 times higher than that of hybrid placement. Under cyclic loading, irreversible damage to the conductivity of fully supported fractures is mainly caused by the concave embedding, fracture, sliding of proppants, and the adsorption retention of fracturing fluids. Under the influence of multiple factors, the fracture conductivity has a linear relationship with the change of confining pressure. This study can provide a reference for improving the conductivity of fully supported fractures and the variation of conductivity under cyclic loading.\n               ","13":"\n                  The stratigraphic correlation of well logs is a fundamental and important topic in seismic well log interpretation. As the number of well logs increases, the automatic stratigraphic correlation of well logs is difficult and time-consuming. With the development of the deep learning (DL) models, several of them have been applied to solve the stratigraphic correlation. However, most of these DL models do not consider the multi-scale features of well logs, which makes against with the accurate and automatic stratigraphic correlation. In this study, by utilizing the multi-scale Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model, we propose an edge-guided FPN (EFPN) model for the automatic stratigraphic correlation. The proposed EFPN model first extracts the multi-scale features of well logs, which benefits for the automatic stratigraphic correlation. Then, the EFPN model integrates the multi-scale features via the concat operation, where a side output is added for the further edge guidance. Moreover, we propose a hybrid loss function by combining the edge loss and the cross entropy loss for the automatic stratigraphic correlation. Based on the well logs from Daqing Oilfield, China, we first divide the well logs into the training data set and the blind test data set. After training the EFPN model, we make detailed comparisons with the widely used SegNet model. The numerical results show that the proposed EFPN model could obtain the stratigraphic correlation of well logs more accurately than the SegNet model, especially for the stratigraphic sequence boundaries and the boundaries of well logs.\n               ","14":"\n                  Gas hydrate is mainly explored through seismic methods, which, however, are bedeviled by the problem of uncertainty due to lack of constraints.

A number of models were proposed to simulate the elastic properties of gas hydrate bearing sediments, addressing different mechanisms and applications. However, they are generally miscellaneous, making it difficult to choose the proper model in a specific scenario. Besides, since the simulation usually involves multiple sub-models and steps, determining the uncertainty sources is troublesome. We summarize the previous models and classify them into five categories according to different principles, which include hydrate morphology, frame structure, research purpose, hydrate generation stage, and lithology. We also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different models and explain the application scenarios. Moreover, we also generalize the modeling workflow, enumerate the feasible models in each step, and indicate the possible uncertainty sources. In the end, we summarize the problems in the current modeling and suggest multiple research directions.

Moreover, there are few research results on the mechanism of residual oil retention and stripping on pore surfaces during CO2\u2013N2 combined gas flooding, which need to be improved and supplemented. In this paper, the microscopic interaction process among gas phase, oil phase and pore surfaces were explored by molecular dynamics, the changes in microstructural between n-decane molecules and the spatial distribution of gas molecules and n-decane molecules in the system was clarified. The interaction energy between gas, n-decane and pore surfaces were analyzed to reveal the mechanism of remaining oil retention and stripping. The results indicated that when only CO2 in the gas phase, the oil films were easily divided by CO2 molecules, and the adsorption layer formed by CO2 molecules on the quartz surface could well detach the oil phase from the quartz surfaces. With the increase of the proportion of N2 in the mixed gas, the interaction energy between the gas and n-decane phase and between the gas phase and pore surfaces decreased, and the capacity of the gas phase to peel off the oil films from the pore surfaces was weakened. When the proportion of N2 in the gas phase exceeded 25%, the gas phase has no ability to peel off the oil films from the quartz surfaces.

The uncertainty of the microscopic rock characteristics (grain, mineral, porosity, permeability, and pore-throat structure) and the flow behaviour in the rock matrix, however, hinders effective and efficient exploitation of tight oil reservoirs. In this paper, microscopic rock characteristics together with flow behaviour of the Chang 7 member in the LD and SHB areas have been critically reviewed. Firstly, the effects of provenance, sedimentation, and diagenesis on microscopic rock characteristics are summarized and compared. Then, fluid flow behaviour and appropriate improved oil recovery (IOR) methods in distinct pore-throat structures were evaluated and discussed. In the LD area, provenance comes from the southwest with a high content of quartz, and the lacustrine facies are dominant. The total content of cements and matrix is higher than that of the SHB area with a high content of illite. In the SHB area, the feldspar content of northeast provenance is higher and its river delta facies has a coarser grain size than that of the LD area, and its chlorite cementation is found to be more popular. These petrology characteristics lead to the fact that, in the LD area, compared with the SHB area, the distributions of porosity, permeability, and pore-throat radius are more concentrated (i.e., a narrower distribution range). In the LD area, the diversified pore-throat characteristics lead to a higher microscopic sweep efficiency than that in the SHB area, and displacement efficiency can be increased by choosing appropriate IOR agents; however, decreasing the minimum movable throat radius can improve the oil recovery factor in the SHB area.

Only if hydraulic fractures connect the natural fractures and caves are there obvious hydraulic fracturing effects. However, the faults, caves, and natural fractures distributed in the bedrock resulted in the distribution of the complex in-situ stress field, which restricts the direction and geometry of hydraulic fracture, thus deciding whether hydraulic fracture could connect with natural fractures and caves. Therefore, an accurate description of the magnitude and direction of the stress field in different regions of faults and caves is of great significance. In this paper, a series of hydraulic fracturing experiments on artificial carbonate samples with presetting faults and caves were performed. And high-precision strain sensors prefabricated in the rock sample were used to monitor the stress field during fracturing. Four kinds of fault-cave geological combinations are investigated, and the results show that the presence of fault-karst can significantly change the distribution of in-situ stress and result in deflecting of the fracture, which may or may not be beneficial to connection of caves and faults, depending on well placement. There is high stress concentration at the end of the fault, and the maximum and minimum principal stresses are obviously higher than the far-field stresses. The lateral stress of a single fault is very low in the direction perpendicular to the fault plane, and there is little change in the direction parallel to the fault. Due to low maximum and minimum stress, the intersection of intersecting faults will exert a kind of \u201cattraction\u201d to hydraulic fractures. The stress distribution around the cave is lower than that in the distance.

These estimates are very close to the true permeability, measured or computed, of the host sample in rocks with well-connected pore space, including high-porosity sand, glass bead packs, low-to-medium porosity sandstones, and some carbonates. They are higher than the true permeability in carbonates with relatively large pores connected by constricted conduits. They fail in impermeable synthetically constructed samples with disconnected pores. Still, this extremely simple method proves to be viable for a large class of natural rocks. Moreover, it can be used to construct a permeability-porosity trend from a microscopic 2D image by selecting subsections of this image and computing their permeability-porosity pairs. Because the measured or computed permeability-porosity pair of the host 3D sample falls upon such a trend, we argue that this trend may be applicable at a spatial scale much coarser that of the pore-scale image.\n               ","20":"\n                  The extraction of oil and gas typically involves drilling boreholes through various subsurface strata. Abrupt variations in the formation properties can severely compromise the borehole stability if the drilling process is not adequately controlled.

This causes a destabilization in the drilling operation known as a \u201ckick\u201d which, if not controlled, may lead to serious well incidents. Modern drilling operations are continuously monitored using various logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools including ultrasonic imaging to assure a high degree of control over the drilling process.

An automatic grid refinement procedure is developed to iteratively conduct LGR around complex fractures. In each iteration, the cells intersected by or close to fractures are selected and refined. The size of the refinement region and the level of refinement can be adjusted. Through this process, the cell size in the near-fracture region is reduced rapidly, while the total cell count remains at a relatively low level.

The new shear rates are used to predict model parameters of Bingham plastic (BP), power-law (PL), Herschel\u2013Bulkley (HB), and Robertson-Stiff (RS) models, and corresponding frictional pressure drops. The efficacy of the above rheology models with improved model parameters is tested by validating the literature-reported experimental pressure drop data of low to high yield stress water-based drilling fluids. The validation results are consistent and accurately predict frictional pressure drops using HB and RS models with the lowest MSE-values. The above methodology is applied to predict frictional pressure drops in a pipe for ten test high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) drilling fluids of varying base fluids at the surface and HPHT conditions in laminar and turbulent flow regimes. For this, isothermal compressibility and thermal decomposition temperature of drilling fluids are measured to forecast the temperature- and pressure-dependent densities and shear viscosities. The proposed density model is experimentally validated and found to predict density at downhole conditions adequately with mean absolute- and standard-deviation, i.e., 1.67 and 1.36%, respectively. Temperature- and pressure-dependent viscosity and density have been used to predict pressure drop under downhole conditions using HB and RS models with improved model parameters from the phenomenological model. The HB model is found to be more accurate than the RS model for predicting pressure drop. The proposed frictional pressure drop estimation method in the present study is more general and accurate under the surface and downhole conditions than the conventional practice.\n               ","24":"\n                  The Qaidam Basin is a Cenozoic continental salt-lake basin in China. The lakes within this basin develop various salinities. This paper studies the geochemical characteristics of source rocks and petroleum in different salinity environments. Our results indicate that from the Paleogene to the Neogene, the salinity in the western Hongshi Sag gradually decreased and that the salinity in the eastern Zhahaquan Sag gradually increased, reflecting the eastward movement of the sedimentary center of the Paleogene basin. However, the salinities of western strata are still higher than those of the eastern strata. Due to the salinity differences between sedimentary water sources, the geochemical characteristics of source rocks and their products are also different. We can categorize these oils into two types according to their geochemical characteristics: Type A and Type B. Type A materials are produced around the Hongshi Sag and are the product of salt water deposition, while Type B materials are produced around the Zhahaquan Sag and are the products of freshwater deposition. Compared with Type B, Type A has the advantages of a high gamma paraffin index, a low Pr\/Ph value, and a uniform carbon number of n-alkanes. Simultaneously, some geochemical parameters (Ts\/Tm, OEP, Pr\/Ph, etc.) lose their significance due to high salinity during formation. Geochemical differences between these sedimentary environments make it relatively easy to distinguish the source rocks for each type: Type A materials come from the E3\n                     2 source rock in the Hongshi Sag and Type B materials come from the E3\n                     2 source rock in the Zhahaquan Sag.

This phenomenon has led to considerable uncertainty in determining the gas hydrate layers and measuring the gas hydrate saturation. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the underlying factors appropriately to optimize exploration and production. In the present study, digital rock technology was combined with field-scale well-logging data to analyze the conductivity mechanism and identify the causes of the observed low resistivity. The obtained results and sensitivity analysis indicated that the rock porosity was the main controlling factor, and then the formation water salinity, pore structure, micro-fractures, clay components, heavy minerals, and gas hydrate pore-habits were the other significant parameters in the order of high to low significance with the corresponding significance values of 3.64, 2.51, 1.97, 1.72, 1.36, 1.04, and 0.56, respectively. Moreover, wells DK-8, DK11-14, and DK12-13 were taken as examples to analyze the formation mechanism of low-resistivity gas hydrate, and the results showed that the high reservoir porosity, developed micro-pores, high irreducible water saturation and good pore connectivity are the main reasons for the low-resistivity gas hydrate in DK-8; and micro-fractures and the banded distribution of clay are responsible for the low-resistivity gas hydrate in wells DK11-14 and DK12-13, respectively.

The biological sources and sedimentary environments of the E2s1 source rocks were studied based on the analyses of organic geochemistry and organic petrology. The results indicate that E2s1 source rocks were deposited in a lacustrine environment with relatively high salinity, which caused the stratification of water body and anoxic bottom conditions. The abundant and stable presence of regular steranes, dinosteranes, 4\u03b1-methyl-24-ethylcholestanes, 24-norcholestanes, 24-n-propylcholestanes, hopanes, 2\u03b1-methylhopanes, and 3\u03b2-methylhopanes in the studied samples indicate that dinoflagellates, diatoms, pelagophyceae, cyanobacteria, rhizobiales and aerobic methanotrophs were the main biological sources of the E2s1. Among them, dinoflagellates are closely related to the formation of organic-rich E2s1 source rocks, which is supported by the positive correlation between TOC or HIvalues and 4\u03b1-methyl-24-ethylcholestane (biomarker of dinoflagellates) contents. Trace amounts of terrestrial higher plant biomarkers in the studied samples indicated that their contributions to organic matter were limited. This is consistent with the abundance of lamalginite and mineral-bituminous groundmasses observed in the E2s1 samples under optical micrographs. Widely occurring marine incursion events in the Eocene in the Bohai Bay Basin may have also occurred during the deposition of the E2s1 in the Liaodong Bay subbasin, supported by the presence of a typical marine pelagophyceae biomarker (24-n-propylcholestane).\n               ","27":"\n                  The pumping unit is the most important lifting equipment in the rod pumping system, which transmits ground power to the downhole pump through its sucker rod. Trajectory identification of the rod pumping system can be used to study the motion law of the pumping unit, and it is the basis for the design of the pumping parameters and the analysis of the working conditions. Most of the studies on the dynamics of the pumping unit are to discuss the simple harmonic motion of the suspension point or the motion of the crank-slider in the ideal state, which is quite different from the actual situation. In this paper, a key point detection method for oil pumping units based on high-resolution representation learning is proposed. The model adopts a multi-resolution parallel network, which connects multiple network branches with different resolutions in parallel. Then it performs multi-stage processing on the input pumping unit images and outputs the predicted Gaussian heatmaps of key points to realize the trajectory recognition of the pumping unit. Different from the traditional series convolutional network structure, which needs to recover high resolution from low resolution, the parallel structure of this model is able to maintain the high resolution of the backbone network and thus the learned representations are more accurate in spatial location. This method is also experimentally verified and compared with the latest convolutional network structure. The results show that the model accuracy of the high-resolution representation learning method is more than 6% higher than that of the comparison methods. In addition, the results of this model can be used to judge the balance of the pumping unit, automatically calculate the maximum stroke and polished rod stroke, and have guiding significance for the working condition diagnosis of the rod pumping system.\n               ","28":"\n                  The pore structure and mineral composition play a crucial role in controlling the water flow behaviors of low-permeability media, which is characterized by threshold pressure gradient (TPG) and nonlinear flow curve. To figure out the coupling effects of these two factors on pre-Darcy flow regimes, water flow experiments were conducted on four tight sandstones, three shales and one fractured shale. The results indicate that both the TPG and pseudo threshold pressure gradient (PTPG) decrease with an increase in total porosity and macropores porosity. The variation of the nonlinear exponent (n) with total porosity and macropore porosity can be described by an exponential function with three parameters. The clay minerals and brittle minerals exert completely opposite influence on the variation of pre-Darcy flow parameters (PTPG, TPG and n). Both TPG\/PTPG and n increase with increasing clay content while reduce with increase in the brittle minerals content. Theoretical analyses based on the disjoining pressure demonstrate that immovable water and electro-viscous effect are mainly responsible for water flow deviating from Darcy's law in tight sandstone and shale. Calculation results show that the proportion of immovable water of intact samples ranges from 23.46% to 89.73%, the movable water content ranges from 10.27%\u201376.54%. The pre-Darcy flow parameters exponentially increase with increase in immovable water content while exponentially decrease with increasing proportion of movable water. For the shale sample used in this work, the immovable water and electro-viscous effect contributing to the pre-Darcy flow account for 81.11%\u201390.35% and 9.58%\u201318.51%, respectively. The different flow regimes are controlled by the pore diameter and the thickness of water with shear fluidity. If the diameter of interconnected pores is larger than 10\u00a0\u03bcm, the Darcy flow regime dominates. When the diameter of minor pore throat of the flow channels are less than 33.82\u00a0nm for sandstones and 37.68\u00a0nm for shales, the movement of water in this flow channel would generate the TPG.\n               ","29":"\n                  Multi-objective differential evolution with hybrid local dynamic search algorithm (HMODE-DLS) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are applied successfully in a reservoir sector model of a Middle Eastern real-world oil field under waterflood development. The Pareto solutions of the two objectives of maximum oil production and minimum water production obtained by the two algorithms are analyzed and compared in this study. The sector model consists of four oil producers and three water injectors and it is run for ten years with twenty time-steps of six months each. A total of 140 decision variables are defined as bottom-hole pressures for the four producers and water injection rates for the three water injectors at each time step (i.e. 7 variables by 20 time-steps). The optimal Pareto solution is obtained at 12,600 function evaluations by HMODE-DLS with 70% convergence improvement compared to 42,000 objective evaluations by NSGA-II. Results show that NSGA-II generated more optimum solutions in the lower range (i.e. less than 480 thousand m3 (Mm3) total oil production) whereas, the hybrid MODE-DLS has a more optimum solution in the higher range of the Pareto front. The net flow method (NFM) is usedin this study to select the best optimal solutions from the Pareto front solutions based on the weight of the objective function chosen by the decision-maker. By using the entropy weight criteria, the best optimal solution of high oil production determined is 540.45\u00a0Mm3\u00a0at the HMODE-DLS Pareto front.

For carbonate reservoirs, this process is benefited by the reaction of the fluid with the matrix. However, generally the process is restricted to occurs only in regions of high permeability. In order, to solve this problem, acid diverting fluids based on viscoelastic surfactants (VES) are commonly used. The divergence in this case is caused by viscosity changes of VES triggered by chemical stimulus, such as pH variations. Formulations based in VES can be prepared to respond to [H+] and [Ca2+], tuning the rheological properties of the surfactant solution and producing polymer-like aggregates named as wormlike micelles. When increasing the viscosity due to these responses, the divergence phenomenon occurs, and the fluid changes its direction heading regions of low permeability. As consequence, desirable corrosion patterns known as wormholes are formed. A laboratory scale investigation might be required to properly adopt such special fluids, so a protocol for neutralization of acid fluids was stablished and tested by using two commercial fluids. The rheology of the fluids upon different neutralizing degrees were studied and simulates the rheological behavior when they are flowing and reacting into the carbonate matrix. Additionally, several generations of a new responsive diverting fluid based on VES, named as QuoVadis (from the Latin \u201cWhither goest thou\u201d), were developed and their rheological characteristics, in linear and non-linear regimes, were obtained in different H+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Such formulations are subject of a patent application filed in the National Institute of Industrial Property of Brazil (INPI patent application number BR102020006183-6). The QuoVadis samples were submitted to the neutralizing protocol and their rheological behaviors were considered to evaluate their performance in several core-flooding experiments.

Conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have difficulty obtaining a large number of real fault samples. These approaches usually train on artificially synthesized samples, bringing about challenge for accurate prediction of different faults, especially for buried hill faults.

First, we construct two traditional semantic segmentation networks, i.e., U-Net and SegNet, to form a new 3D U-SegNet network. Next, we train this network using plenty of 3D synthetic seismic data. Finally, we implement transfer learning by model fine-tuning using a few labeled real data. The method is applied to the buried hill field data, and the result proves that the U-SegNet network, after transfer learning, can reduce the cases of fault miss and false detection and can effectively improve the accuracy, which verifies the value of this research for complicated buried hill fault detection.\n               ","32":"\n                  Scale and corrosion issues of well pipelines become more prominent in geothermal exploitation at temperatures exceeding 100\u00a0\u00b0C.

The functional groups and molecular weight of PZGS were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The scale inhibitor contains carboxylic acid groups, amide groups, phosphonic acid groups, and sulfonic acid groups. These groups ensure the capability of PZGS to chelate Ca2+, thus promoting the lattice distortion of calcium carbonate scale and improving its scale inhibition performance and temperature resistance. The number average molecular weight and the weight average molecular weight of PZGS are 5446\u00a0g\/mol and 7139\u00a0g\/mol respectively. The scale inhibition rate of 480\u00a0mg\/L PZGS could reach 95% at 150\u00a0\u00b0C which is better than common scale inhibitors such as nitrogen trimethyl triphosphonic acid (ATMPA) and diethylenetriamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid (DTPMPA), whose inhibition rates are just 62% and 60% at 150\u00a0\u00b0C respectively. With the increase of the concentration, the formation of aragonite and vaterite gradually increased while calcite decreased because of the chelation and lattice distortion of polycarboxylic acid groups, phosphonic acid, sulfonic acid, and other groups from PZGS over the calcium carbonate scale.

In this work, we first experimentally verify an image-based dynamic pore-network model of spontaneous imbibition that is computationally efficient. Then, case studies of a Nubian sandstone are conducted.

It is found that the filling mode evolves from the co-filling of neighboring pores to the preferential filling of small pores as the nonwetting viscosity increases.

We address such an issue by presenting a methodology, driven by the data and applied to a real case history, where basic pressure transients are used to tag and track, along a pipeline, different batches of a multiphase medium. Several statistical indicators, computed from the pressure data and on different window lengths, are employed to train a machine learning model, which learns to distinguish the characteristic behavior of two different oil-gas slugs: in practice, each different combination of fluid phases (in terms of gas\/oil ratio in a given batch of product) and each different sequence of slugs (in terms of gas\/oil ratio variability between successive batches) behaves like a coded tag linked to the flowing fluid. The key innovation consists in the possibility of tracking such multiphase slugs along the flowline and at each monitoring station: this allows one to determine in real-time the fluid composition entering\/exiting the line, its position, and its movement along the pipe. As such, we obtain also a virtual metering system, able to provide estimates of the flow rate and phases ratio. Moreover, by having several recording stations accurately synchronized, one can also leverage real-time transmission and multichannel processing of the data, enabling the opportunity for online monitoring applications.

As a result, the HAP NF proved very effective in reducing IFT and altering wettability under both low and high salinity environments, and it is thus suggested for EOR operations.\n               ","40":"\n                  The Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi shale is the main producing layer of shale gas in the northern Sichuan Basin. Natural fractures are considered an important factor that influences the exploration and development of shale gas. In this study, outcrops, drill cores, thin sections, fluid inclusions and rare earth element (REE) were analyzed to determine the characteristics, changes in fluid chemistry, and fluid source of different types of fractures and then reveal their effects on the accumulation and preservation of shale gas. Natural fractures of Qiongzhusi shale are mainly composed of non-strata-bounded fractures (NSBFs), strata-bounded fractures (SBFs), and bed-parallel fractures (BPFs). NSBFs span multiple layers, which can significantly enhance the vertical connectivity of shale reservoirs. There are three dominant orientations of NSBFs, as N-S, NNE-SSW, and E-W trends. The E-W trending fractures, which intersect with the maximum principal stress (NWW-SEE) at a small angle, have larger permeability and control the vertical leakage of shale gas. SBFs are confined to individual layers. Homogenization temperatures of aqueous inclusions in SBF veins vary from 149.7 to 172.3\u00a0\u00b0C. Calcite veins exhibit positive Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a011.71, 27.9). Analysis of fluid inclusions and rare earth elements indicated that SBF vein-precipitating fluids were derived from the surrounding wall rock. The development of SBFs contributes to shale gas enrichment. BPFs are parallel to bedding planes or intersect at a low angle (<20\u00b0). Microstructural analysis suggests that cemented BPFs form from the multiple crack-seal processes. The temperature of fluid during mineral precipitation exceeds 200\u00a0\u00b0C. REE concentrations vary significantly across the BPF veins (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a02.31\u2013119.37), donating that fluid characteristics episodically changed during vein growth. The methane inclusions trapped in cements and mixing externally sourced fluids indicate that BPFs are the preferential fluid-flow pathway of shale gas and controls the lateral migration of shale gas.\n               ","41":"\n                  Recently, a new type of carbonate reservoir, the fault-karst carbonate reservoir has attracted lots of attention, which usually develops large-scale karst caves, vugs, and high-angle fractures along the strike-slip fault zones. Despite containing plenty of hydrocarbon resources, the complex geological structure and the strong heterogeneity make it difficult to develop this kind of reservoir effectively and economically. To perform water-drive experiments and investigate the production performance under different well patterns and injection-production modes, two 2D visualized physical models were designed and fabricated based on the typical geological structures of the fault-karst carbonate reservoir in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. According to the experimental results, the average oil recovery can reach 62.96% for the vertical model and 58.18% for the horizontal model. In fact, gravity effect due to density differences can greatly improve the displacement efficiency of oil by water in the vertical direction; hence, the horizontal heterogeneity would have a relatively greater impact on waterflooding development. When water is injected into the reservoir from the middle section, a large amount of un-swept oil will remain at the bottom fractures. Thus, the Bottom Injection & Top Production (BI & TP) mode should be adopted in all well patterns to increase recovery. If non-inverted well patterns are employed, dominant water channeling would form quickly in the horizontal direction, and the swept area will be hugely limited. Therefore, the Center Injection & Edge Production mode (inverted well patterns) is recommended for water-drive applications. It is also found that the water breakthrough time negatively correlates with the effective flooding time for the vertical model and the total oil recovery is more impacted by water breakthrough for both models. Additionally, the oil-water exchange ratio is introduced to evaluate the utilization efficiency of injected water. Calculation results have shown that the BI & TP mode is optimal in terms of either total recovery or oil-water exchange ratio in the vertical direction, but the well pattern layout in the horizontal direction could impact the oil recovery and oil-water exchange ratio, which, in turn, affect the project economics. This study provides novel insights for optimizing well patterns and waterflooding measures in actual fault-karst carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","42":"\n                  Fractured tight reservoirs have widespread exploration and development prospects. For these types of reservoirs, fractures provide pathways for fluid flow and storage spaces for tight oil and gas, which play a significant role in increasing production. In order to explore a fine fracture evaluation scheme for tight reservoirs, we firstly proposed an intelligent calculation method for the relative sonic attenuation; and then developed a novel semi-quantitative evaluation approach for the equivalent fracture width based on relative sonic attenuation and physical experimental results of the effect of fracture on sonic attenuation. The acoustic experimental results of the models with fractures show that the S-wave relative attenuation coefficients have a good correlation with the fracture attribute parameters. This lays a foundation for the fine fracture evaluation based on attenuation information. Field application results of the intelligent calculation method for relative attenuation and the inversion method for fracture width have been validated by comparing them with results from image logging, S-wave anisotropy estimation, and production test data, which demonstrates the feasibility and correctness of the proposed methods. The investigation depth of the proposed fracture evaluation scheme based on acoustic attenuation is significantly larger than that of the image logging, which provides a new optional scheme for fine fracture evaluation, especially for effective fracture evaluation; and it makes up for the deficiencies of the image logging fracture evaluation method.\n               ","43":"\n                  In this study, the performance of a large number of anionic (SDS, SLS, and SDBS), cationic (CTAB), and non-ionic (Triton X-100 and Tween 80) surfactants on the surface activity, emulsion size, and surface charge of five oil samples was investigated in aqueous solution with two different salinities, with the aid of interfacial tension (IFT) measurement, zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. In addition, the most important parameters that can affect the IFT of crude oil\/surfactant solutions (i.e. charge of the hydrophilic group and chain length of the hydrophobic hydrocarbon group of the surfactants and different characteristics of crude oil such as \u00b0API, acidity, weight percentage of the asphaltene and resin fractions, their aromaticity and polarity, and asphaltene stability parameter) were comprehensively analyzed. The results showed that IFT values, surface charge of the aggregates, and the size of microemulsions depend on the crude oil type, ionic strength, and type of surfactants, however, without any straightforward proportionality with the examined parameters. Among the considered surfactants, the cationic and non-ionic surfactant showed the lowest and highest dependency to the crude oil type, respectively. A paramount efficiency was obtained for CTAB cationic surfactant with the microemulsion size of 102\u00a0nm and surface charge at near isoelectric point (zeta potential of 3.5\u00a0mV).\n               ","44":"\n                  Re-using existing infrastructure has become a standard approach for the development of marginal offshore oil fields. Many small discoveries are, however, located in remote areas or require unreasonably high costs to be tied back to already installed production facilities. Feasible solutions must be found to develop such prospects in a cost-efficient way. In this paper, we analyze whether sequential development of two stand-alone small fields (A and B) using the same production facilities can be an economical strategy compared to the investment in parallel development. We apply and compare two different approaches to evaluate such a sequential strategy. The first considers that the decision maker maximizes the recovery factor of Field A first and then invests in Field B disregarding the information about uncertain factors (\u201cmyopic\u201d approach). The second approach allows accounting for the decision maker\u2019s ability to optimize the development strategy given it can learn about uncertainties over time and initiate switching between two fields when it is optimal, or leave Field B undeveloped (\u201coptions\u201d approach). We account for several sources of uncertainty affecting the project value: Fields A and B reservoir uncertainty that is replicated by a benchmark reservoir model, oil price, operational expenditure (OPEX), and capital expenditure (CAPEX) to switch between two fields. Our findings are threefold: (1) sequential investment can be the preferred development concept for small stand-alone discoveries; (2) the sequential development strategy allows the downside risks of the investment to be partly hedged, including the reservoir, oil price, and cost risks; (3) the \u201coptions\u201d approach is needed to capture the additional monetary value of such a strategy and is considered to be a superior method to assess the value of the sequential production as opposed to a \u201cmyopic\u201d approach.\n               ","45":"\n                  The lacustrine conglomerate reservoirs of the Lijin sag, Bohai Bay Basin, East China, were studied to understand the roles of depositional and diagenetic events on reservoir quality, using integrated seismic data, well logs, core observations, optical petrography, SEM-EDS, cathodoluminescence, and fluid inclusion microthermometry. The results show a fan delta with well-connected conglomerate bodies deposited during a highstand system tract (HST) and a nearshore subaqueous fan with weakly connected conglomerate bodies deposited in a transgressive system tract (TST). The conglomerates are mainly classified as feldspathic litharenite. The porosity and permeability of the fan delta vary from 0.1% to 17.4% and 0.01 to 457.6 mD, respectively. The porosity and permeability vary from 2.02 to 16.2% and 0.02 to 237.2 mD in the nearshore subaqueous fan. Mechanical compaction, dissolution, and cementation together are noteworthy diagenetic processes. Compaction is the dominant factor in reducing porosity; cementation has a destructive effect, while dissolution improves reservoir quality. Feldspar dissolution leads to kaolinite, illite, dickite precipitation, and deteriorating reservoir quality. The probable sources of meteoric water flux in the deep-burial environments are related to the falling lake level during the HST. Fluid inclusion analysis revealed that quartz overgrowths were formed during the mesodiagenetic stage. The depositional environment and grain sizes are essential factors controlling reservoir quality. The effect of grain size and sorting coefficients on reservoir quality varies as a function of retrogradation and progradation sequences. The higher the porosity and permeability, the coarser the particle sizes in the retrogradation sequences. In the progradation sequences, poorly sorted sediments have higher porosity and permeability than well-sorted sediments. The braided channel embodies the best reservoir quality in the TST, while the distributary channel represents the best reservoir in the HST.\n                  The formation mechanism of the high-quality reservoirs is ascribed to the sedimentary facies, compaction resistance, and mineral dissolution. Overall, the conglomerate reservoirs developed in the HST are relatively better than those in the TST because they have greater labile fragments, resulting in more dissolution. This study demonstrated that for successful assessment of conglomerate reservoirs in the Lijin area and similar reservoirs elsewhere, reservoirs characterization must link sequence stratigraphy, facies, and diagenesis to understand the high-quality reservoir distribution to support the predrill evaluation of reservoirs.\n               ","46":"\n                  Surfactant-based foam drainage technology is a favored method of liquid accumulation removal, and it has been demonstrated as an efficient way to improve gas production efficiency. However, foam properties are extremely complex and the same surfactant can produce foam systems with widely varying properties under different environmental conditions. This has a huge impact on the multiphase flow containing foam and thus on the efficiency of fluid removal. To further explore the influences of changing foam properties on the flow characteristics and the liquid-carrying capacity of foam, this study experimentally investigated the gas\u2013liquid multiphase flow containing different foams in a hilly terrain pipeline with different properties in pipelines by adding SDS surfactant and MgCl2. The results show that the foam stability can significantly affect the gas\u2013liquid multiphase flow characteristics. Adding MgCl2 enhances the stability of SDS foam. This narrows the range of intermittent flow conditions and leads to a significant fall in the critical gas velocity corresponding to the transition from intermittent to separated flow. Meanwhile, under the same gas and liquid velocities conditions, the foam with higher stability has a more pronounced suppression effect on the velocity of liquid in the upward inclined section, both the slug velocity and the liquid reflux velocity. The reduction in the holding rate also indicates that a more-stable foam improves the liquid-carrying capacity of gas and the discharge efficiency. In addition, as the gas velocity increases, the enhanced stability promotes the transition of the flow pattern from stratified to annular flow, resulting in a remarkable increase in the pressure drop gradient. This suggests that a more stable foam system is suitable for environments with lower gas velocities.\n               ","47":"\n                  An exploration breakthrough was made in the Paleogene strata in the Binhai fault nose of the Huanghua Depression, but the distribution of hydrocarbons remained insufficient to understand. A series of fault-controlled traps were formed around the Gangdong fault, especially a large number of fault-block traps, which gave us a unique opportunity to use seismic data to study the distribution of the hydrocarbons under the control of normal fault and caprocks. By analysing the vertical and lateral changes of the fault throws (T-x and T-z plots), combined with the expansion index (EI), the characteristics of the Gangdong fault were studied and the evolution process of the fault was reconstructed. The fault has undergone the evolution process of lateral and dip linkage, and finally, the Gangdong fault was formed. The reconstruction of the evolution process and determination of charging stages found that the Gangdong fault was formed dip linkage just before late Neogene, providing an excellent vertical pathway for hydrocarbon migration. Besides, when the fault throw exceeds than 39\u00a0m, hydrocarbons were found near the fault, indicating a lower limit of fault throw. However, there were differences in the spatial distribution of hydrocarbons in the study area, which may be related to the integrity of the caprock. A lower thickness limit was found by analysing the relationship between the difference in hydrocarbon distribution above and below the regional caprock and the effective caprock thickness. When the effective caprock thickness is greater than this lower thickness limit, hydrocarbons can only accumulate below the caprock. When the effective caprock thickness is less than this lower limit, there is hydrocarbon accumulation above the caprock. This work highlights the evolution of normal fault and the control effect of fault-caprocks on hydrocarbon accumulation and further understands the spatial distribution of petroleum near the fault.\n               ","48":"\n                  The radial jet drilling (RJD) technology is an efficient formation stimulation and injection technology that drills multiple laterals perpendicular to the central well. Extensive research has been on jet rock breaking, lateral extension, productivity prediction, and technological processes. However, little public literature illustrates the overall drilling performance of the RJD systems. Herein, a field test is conducted in the surface sandstone formation. Eight laterals are successfully drilled using the self-rotating multi-orifices nozzle with a 35\u201340\u00a0MPa (5.08\u20135.80 ksi) jet pressure. The cumulative length of the eight laterals is 21.1\u00a0m (69.2\u00a0ft), with the longest one being 5.7\u00a0m (18.7\u00a0ft). The lateral diameter is 50\u00a0mm (1.97 in), drilled at the fastest drilling rate of 3.6\u00a0m\/h (11.8\u00a0ft\/h). The auxiliary traction device can provide extra feed-in force to the high-pressure hose. The lateral trajectories are measured with their accuracy confirmed by the coring well. During the field test, a lateral trajectory up-warping problem is found, of which the possible causes and the suggestions are provided. According to the internal shape of the lateral obtained by endoscopic imaging, the lateral section exhibits a ring structure, indicating the high rock breaking efficiency of the self-rotating multi-orifices nozzle. The formation anisotropy and natural fracture have little influence on the lateral trajectory but affect the lateral section shape.

Numerous laboratory experiments and field tests have demonstrated this effect in both clastic and carbonate rock Samples and reservoirs.

With this in mind, copper ion's potential for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) was studied, combining different conditions usually employed on smart water experiments, such as depleting the total salinity and removing the PDI to highlight the real effect of copper on additional oil recovery. The investigation was carried out with Brazilian pre-salt reservoir Samples in imbibition experiments using Amott cells at ambient pressure and 63\u00a0\u00b0C. The evaluation of the copper effect on oil recovery for coreflooding was proved in a previous paper by Bernadinelli et al. (2021), however the analysis with imbibition experiments in this study aim to clarify the effect of copper on the capillary pressure, by analyzing the eventual additional oil production. These Samples were prepared and aged, and the oil production was monitored during the experimental time. The experiments were carried in four sequences to evaluate the effect of copper on oil recovery, consisting first of salinity reduction from 0% of sodium chloride to 100% of the original amount in the seawater (SW), followed by the removal of PDI salts, the study of the production mode (secondary or tertiary), and the analysis of the copper chloride concentration on the final recovery. The results using copper at the secondary recovery showed remarkable increases (from 6.3% to 10.0%) of the original oil in place (OOIP) compared to the oil recovered from the formation water (FW). In tertiary mode, the best recoveries occurred at salinities between 8 and 18\u00a0kppm and copper chloride (1\u00a0g\/L), and presented increasing recoveries 3.9%, 5.8%, and 9.3% of OOIP.

This study introduces the fractal dimension based NMR permeability estimation for tight sandstone. Core permeability and NMR measurements were performed on thirty tight sandstone samples selected from the Jurassic rocks in the Sichuan Basin, China.

However, in the NGD measurement, the initial energy spectrum, source intensity, and spatial distribution of the secondary inelastic gamma-ray source vary with formation components. Moreover, the energy of inelastic gamma rays is at the MeV level, leading to a non-negligible pair production effect. All these factors affect the accuracy of the bulk-density measurement. In addition, the impact of borehole configuration on NGD is evident, and correction for borehole effects is essential. To improve density accuracy: first, we forgo exploring an explicit theoretical formula for density calculation and instead treat the NGD mathematically as a regression problem and introduce the machine learning regressor, a powerful and popular tool for solving regression problems, into the NGD for the first time; second, we select features less affected by changes in formation chemical composition as input features. Our results show that the final three tuned machine learning regressors selected from the 39 candidate regressors outperform the optimized polynomial model (an optimization of conventional density calculation models) in both accuracy and generalization ability.

Performance of the hybrid nano-smart water solutions as dispersion media at optimum salinity and NC concentrations was assessed. Stability, IFT, zeta potential, and wettability alteration of the solutions were assessed to find the optimum concentrations. Two groups of single and binary salts were used in the smart waters. Smart waters with individual NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, Na2SO4, MgSO4, CaSO4, and K2SO4 salts at concentrations of 1000, 2000, 4000, and 10,000\u00a0ppm in one group.

The optimum concentration of MgSO4 for the carbonate sample obtained was 10,000\u00a0ppm with 250\u00a0ppm of the NC. The lowest IFT (15.42\u00a0mN\/m) was obtained for the nanofluid with an NC concentration of 250\u00a0ppm.

However, it is still a challenge to quantify the influence of stylolites on the Longwangmiao Formation carbonate reservoirs. To better understand the controls on the formation and distribution of stylolites, the Longwangmiao Formation is selected as an example to evaluate the effect of stylolites on the carbonate reservoirs. The mineralogy of the Longwangmiao Formation reservoirs is mainly dominated by dolomite (79.6%) with minor calcite (11.4%), and terrigenous minerals (clay and quartz) (5.6%). The rocks with dolomite content of more than 80%, calcite content of less than 30%, and terrigenous minerals of less than 1% have lower stylolite density and amplitude. The content of dolomite can affect the occurrence of stylolite indicating that the higher abundance of dolomite has a lower density and amplitude of stylolite. Based on the multiple techniques, four types of carbonate lithofacies were recognized, including the grainstone (dolo-grainstone, grainstone), packstone (dolo-packstone, packstone), wackestone (dolo-wackestone, wackestone), and mudstone (dolo-mudstone, mudstone). The distribution of stylolite also shows the lithofacies-specific behavior in the Longwangmiao Formation carbonate reservoirs. The lithofacies of grainstone shows the lowest density and amplitude of stylolite, while the occurrence of stylolite in the mudstone shows the highest abundance. Vertically, the stylolite density and amplitude in the lower part of the fourth-order sequences is higher than this in the upper part.

It has become one of the world's important strategic natural gas reserves and emergency peak-shaving facilities. However, salt cavern gas storage in China is mainly built in the layered salt formation, which is characteristic of thin salt layers with high contents of insoluble mudstone interlayers. During the construction of this type of gas storage, these insoluble interlayers can be left at the bottom of the storage and reduce the storage by 30%\u201370%. It is urgent to study how to effectively control the volumetric expansion of insoluble mudstones and enlarge the storage capacity. In view of this, we first characterize and quantify the rock salt, interlayer mudstones, and clay minerals by XRD. Then, 12 kinds of organic and inorganic shrinkage agents were compared in the shrinkage experiments. Five factors affecting the shrinkage are considered, including the concentration and diffusion distance of shrinkage agents, the mass ratio and particle sizes of mudstones, and the temperature. The optimal recipe and concentration of chemical agents suitable for mudstone shrinkage in salt cavern reservoir are obtained. Finally, based on the shrinking performance of mudstones, SEM scanning, EDS analysis and Zeta potential test, the shrinking mechanism of insoluble mudstones at the bottom of the cavern was proposed. The results show that: The content of swelling clay in the target gas storage is low and the clay swelling is not the main reason for the volumetric expansion of mudstones. High valence cationic salts or polymers can shrink. Among which, the order of shrinking effectiveness is: inorganic polymers\u00a0>\u00a0Inorganic salts\u00a0>\u00a0Organic polymers. When the dosage of PAC-30 is 0.7\u00a0g\/L, the volumetric shrinkage effect of mudstones is more than 40%. It has a great potential to expand the storage capacity of the salt cavern. The study shows that there is an optimum dosage of the shrinkage agent. The increasing temperature and the small particle sizes of mudstones are beneficial to shrinkage. The shrinking process is a diffusion control process, and the shrinkage agents are easy to form a dense layer on the mudstone surface, which hinders the further diffusion of the shrinkage agents. Mechanism studies show that: After the addition of cationic polymer, the Zeta potential on the mudstone grain surface decreased significantly.

The available wax deposition data in the literature are currently insufficient to construct viable predictive numerical methods that capture all wax deposit features. Therefore, more research studies are required to improve our understanding of the physics of wax-deposition phenomena. In the present paper, a numerical study is performed to predict the temporal and spatial distribution of the porous wax deposit during laminar flow in a pipe. A mathematical model which combines the energy and momentum balance equations and molecular diffusion model by Fick's law is employed to better describe the wax deposit. Validation with experimental data as well as numerical results and characteristics of wax deposition are presented. The results revealed that an increase in the deposition time and porosity leads to a significant increase in the wax deposit content and pressure drop, and a decrease in the fluid temperature, heat transfer coefficient, and flow rate. However, an increase in porosity leads to larger variation of these parameters over a short period of time. Further, it is demonstrated that the wax deposit is concentrated over a short axial length, and its maximum which appears at X\/L\u00a0=\u00a00.014 is kept unchanged with time and porosity variation.\n               ","57":"\n                  The Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin contains large quantities of deep coal which can be produced as coal bed methane (CBM) reservoirs. The Mannville Formation of Alberta is an attractive CBM play because of its high gas-in-place potential of 4\u201310 BCF per section depending on coal seam thickness and gas content. One requirement for enhanced reservoir access and gas production is detailed geological models that highlight the heterogeneity of the coal seams \u2013 this provides more insightful understanding of the architecture of the system enabling improved well planning. Here, we describe an ultrarefined Mannville Formation coal bed geological model which was constructed with input data derived from logs, core, core photos, adsorption isotherms, and gas composition analysis. This model reveals the structure of the underground coal beds and shows that they are laterally discontinuous and interbedded between sandstone and shale layers. Since they are subjected to high in-situ stress, low porosity and permeability is observed in these coal seams. The heterogeneity of the coal seams in the Mannville Formation is clear with \u2018lenses\u2019 of coal within the domain.

The real-time analysis of the pressure curve is helpful to evaluate the hydraulic fracture status, and provide guidance for the adjustment of the fracturing treatment. However, the response pattern of hydraulic fracture propagation and fluid flow in the pressure curve is still unclear and difficult to capture. In this paper, the 2D hydraulic fracturing model was built to investigate the effects of different stress differences, elastic modulus, and variable rate. Simultaneously, the wavelet analysis method was introduced to observe its response characteristics. Taking the peak energy of the wavelet as the standard, the db5 wavelet basis is selected as the optimal wavelet basis and the first decomposition level is the optimal recognition level. There is a positive correlation between the pressure drop value and the wavelet peak energy under different stress difference and elastic modulus. In addition, we compared the pressure drop ratio and the wavelet energy ratio found that the wavelet energy can greatly amplify the impact of pressure fluctuations. Comparing the wavelet energy of pressure and rate can eliminate the influence of rate fluctuation on pressure. Finally, the field treatment curve was decomposed and explained by wavelet analysis, then it is compared with the results of microseismic interpretation for the first time.

To validate the proposed fuzzy control strategy, the authors developed a flow loop system for real-time monitoring and controlling the viscosity of carboxymethylcellulose's aqueous solutions. For apparent viscosity monitoring, a tubular viscometer was developed based on volumetric fluid flow and pressure drop in a defined tube length. The control strategy used in this work was based on Fuzzy Logic, with the Mamdani inference method, which was based on the possibility of transferring the linguistic information from the expert process operator's knowledge to the machine domain language, thus establishing the knowledge basis of the fuzzy controller.

Mechanical stratigraphy is evaluated using dipole sonic and density data from the same boreholes in these six gas fields. This study shows that the effect of mechanical stratigraphy on the fracture system in carbonate reservoirs can be evaluated in two scales. Large-scale mechanical stratigraphy, represented by rock strength variations within units with more than 1-m thickness, influences the overall fracture intensity. At the same time, the effect of small-scale mechanical stratigraphy is more pronounced on aperture and continuity as two elements of the morphology of natural fractures. This scale of rock mechanics is practically discernible using high-resolution borehole images. Both scales of mechanical stratigraphy were crucial when building predictive models of reservoir performance in naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","61":"\n                  Spectral data of 193 shale samples collected from Cleveland and Wessex Basins in the United Kingdom were generated from the mid-infrared (MIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum using two types of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic techniques, attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform (DRIFT).

A pair of new rotor and stator with variable clearances were designed, and a novel AMPCP was proposed. Furthermore, the changing law of clearances between the rotor and stator along the axial position of the rotor was studied and controlled, and equations of both their cross-sectional profiles of the rotor as well as stator and the flow area of the AMPCP were derived. The working process including the special internal fluid compression process of the proposed AMPCP and the fluid flows were analyzed by numerical simulations, and the distributions of its internal pressure fields and velocity fields were obtained. Study results show that the proposed AMPCP has a higher outlet pressure and a smaller axial leakage speed than the conventional progressive cavity pump with constant clearances for the same values of other parameters, and the internal compression process of the AMPCP will contribute to increasing the discharge pressure.

The synthesized surfactant was used to formulate and stabilize environmentally-friendly oil-in-water (O\/W) emulsion drilling muds, having soybean oil itself as a dispersed phase, for drilling shale formation. A comparative study on the rheological and filtration properties of soybean oil based emulsion mud systems and a conventional diesel oil based emulsion mud system, prepared in the presence of the synthesized surfactant, was also performed. The properties of soybean oil based emulsion mud systems were found to be superior to diesel oil based emulsion mud. The effect of varying oil content and mud additives (i.e., gum acacia or xanthan gum, and bentonite) on the rheological and filtration properties of drilling mud was also investigated in detail in order to achieve an optimum formulation. Considering the high-temperature application, the thermal stability of rheological and filtration properties of developed muds was investigated up to a temperature of 125\u00a0\u00b0C, and muds were found to be having excellent thermal stability. The developed emulsion mud systems were also found to be showing an excellent tolerance towards mud constituents like salt (KCL). The lubricity of the mud was evaluated, and it appeared that the soyabean oil based mud possesses an excellent lubricity compared to that of diesel oil based mud. The lubricity of the mud increases significantly with the increase in oil concentration. The shale recovery test and core flooding study, respectively, suggested a high shale recovery performance and low formation damage effect for the developed soybean oil-in-water emulsion mud system.

In this article, based on lithological combination characteristics, the source-reservoir spatial assemblages of the Triassic Chang 7 Member in the Qingcheng area of the Ordos Basin are systematically divided into three categories, namely, reservoir-sandwiching source (RSS), source-reservoir interbed (SRI) and source-sandwiching reservoir (SSR). Moreover, the tight sandstone reservoirs in different assemblages were characterized by a combination of macro observations from cores and geophysical logs and microscopic analysis from cast thin sections, FE-SEM, HPMI and XRD data. The results demonstrate that the tight sandstone reservoirs within different source-reservoir assemblages have similar lithological properties, but vary greatly in reservoir quality and natural fracture networks. In general, the RSS sandstones have the broadest pore-throat size distribution and the best physical properties due to the prevalence of residual intergranular pores, and the reservoir quality is slightly better than that of the SRI sandstones and significantly better than that of the SSR sandstones. Additionally, natural fracture types and fracture intensities vary greatly in different source-reservoir assemblages. The RSS assemblage contains mainly high-dip angle fractures with relatively low fracture intensities, the SSR assemblage is dominated by low-dip angle bedding-parallel fractures with relatively high intensities, and the SRI assemblage is characterized by a combination of these two assemblages. Under the control of overpressure derived from hydrocarbon generation, tight reservoirs with different source-reservoir assemblages present different lower limits of petrophysical properties for tight oil charging, and the effective reservoir proportion leads to a decreasing enrichment degree in the RSS, SRI and SSR assemblages successively. Furthermore, the natural fractures in different source-reservoir assemblages enhance the storage capacity while contributing to disparities in the vertical migration of tight oil. The natural fracture network of the vertically stacked RSS assemblage allows tight oil to migrate upward for a relatively long distance, while the SSR assemblage can effectively prevent the upward migration of the tight oil, thus forming differential tight oil accumulation and distribution characteristics in the different source-reservoir assemblages.\n               ","68":"\n                  In this paper, solvent bubble nucleation and liberation processes in the heavy crude oil\u2212CO2 systems, heavy crude oil\u2212CH4 systems and heavy crude oil\u2212C3H8 systems were experimentally studied and theoretically analyzed. First, two respective series of tests were conducted for different heavy crude oil\u2212solvent systems. The first series included eleven conventional isothermal constant-composition-expansion (CCE) tests and the other series consisted of three new isothermal constant-composition-expansion & compression (CCEC) tests. Second, the amount of the evolved gas (i.e., the dispersed gas and free gas) in each pressure reduction step was determined from the measured CCE test data to study the solvent bubble nucleation process in each heavy crude oil\u2212solvent system. A new quantity named the bubble nucleation index (BNI) was introduced and used to represent the solvent bubble nucleation strength. Third, the respective amounts of the dispersed gas and free gas in each pressure reduction step were obtained from the measured CCEC test data to examine the solvent bubble liberation processes in three heavy crude oil\u2212solvent systems. A second new quantity named the bubble liberation index (BLI) was defined and applied to represent the solvent bubble liberation strength.

Region I was the one-phase region. Region II was the foamy-oil region, in which the solvent bubble nucleation started and the solvent bubbles were dispersed in the heavy oil. Region III was the two-phase region, in which the free-gas phase was formed and started to dominate the total compressibility of the heavy crude oil\u2212solvent system. In addition, the solvent supersaturation vs. reduced pressure data indicated that the heavy crude oil\u2212CH4 system had the lowest solvent supersaturation at the same reduced pressure in comparison with the heavy crude oil\u2212CO2 or C3H8 system. Thus CH4 was easier to be nucleated from the heavy oil in comparison with CO2 or C3H8. Moreover, the BNI vs. solvent supersaturation data showed that the BNI of the heavy crude oil\u2212CH4 or C3H8 system was slowly increased at lower solvent supersaturations but quickly increased at higher solvent supersaturations, whereas the BNI of the heavy crude oil\u2212CO2 system was almost linearly increased with solvent supersaturation. Furthermore, the BLI vs. reduced pressure data revealed that in comparison with C3H8\/CO2, CH4 was the most difficult solvent to be liberated from the heavy oil once its bubbles were nucleated. A large amount of CH4 bubbles could be trapped in the heavy oil to induce the strongest and most stable foamy oil in comparison with C3H8 and CO2. The above experimental findings help to better understand the foamy-oil strengths and stabilities in different heavy crude oil\u2212solvent systems and determine the most suitable solvent to optimize a solvent-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process in a heavy oil reservoir.\n               ","69":"\n                  Jetting has been widely used in the petroleum fields, the nozzle has been investigated for a long time and the structure has been optimized for different applications as the key part of jetting.

Different pressure drops, from 5 to 15\u00a0bar were tested and described in terms of free gas removed (desired event) and hydrates destroyed (undesired event) before the injection of carbon dioxide. A few pronounced pressure drop might be not enough to ensure an effective replacement, while an excessive one might be not sustainable due to the high quantity of hydrates destroyed before the process. In this work, variation of hydrates and free gas was evaluated before and after depressurization; it was then compared and employed to define an optimum range of pressure drop to optimize the process. It was proved that the quantity of hydrates destroyed increases with the pressure drop imposed, while the removal of free gas shows a maximum. When depressurization was close to 10\u00a0bar, only 18.57% of hydrates dissociated, while the quantity of free gas removed was three times higher (59.27%).

In situ upgrading of bitumen through co-injection of steam and oxygen is evaluated in this work. Three different types of laboratory experiments, including one static thermal cracking experiment, one ramped temperature oxidation (RTO) experiment, and one combustion tube test, were performed to examine the produced oil properties and the potential of bitumen in situ upgrading. A comprehensive analysis of produced oil properties and gas composition was performed. Bitumen was significantly upgraded in the thermal cracking experiment at a temperature of 430\u00a0\u00b0C, in which Saturates fraction increased to 56%, while Resin and Asphaltene fractions reduced to 6.7% and 6.8%, respectively. The thermal cracking of Resin and Asphaltene contribute to the production of the light oil and gases, leading to the upgrading of the bitumen. Dynamic properties of produced oil were measured in the RTO and combustion tube test in terms of produced oil viscosity, density, boiling point temperature distribution, and produced oil compositions, etc. In the RTO test, the extent of bitumen upgrading is greater with the increase of temperature, further proving that the high temperature generated by the combustion front is able to effectively crack the bitumen. Furthermore, the lack of light hydrocarbon in the produced oil indicates light hydrocarbon participates in the high temperature oxidation reactions. Different from thermal cracking experiment and RTO test results, combustion tube test results indicated that the bitumen was slightly upgraded in late stage of the combustion tube test and most produced bitumen are similar with original bitumen. By examining the temperature distribution along the combustion tube, it is found that upgraded bitumen cannot be effectively displaced to the producer.

In a temperature range of 250\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C and a pressure range of 4.2\u201321\u00a0MPa, the mixture of hetero-PAHs and Sub-CW shows an equilibrium between water-rich and oil-rich liquid phases, characterized by a significant dissolution of water in the oil phase. The solubility of Sub-CW is 1.9\u20133.8\u00a0wt% in N-containing hetero-PAHs and 1.0 to 2.7\u00a0wt% in S-containing hetero-PAHs. Compared with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the same ring number, the presence of the thiophenic ring in hetero-PAHs leads to a decrease in the solubility of Sub-CW. The particularity of N-containing hetero-PAHs lies in the hydrogen bond between the pyridinic ring and water molecules, which increases the solubility of Sub-CW at temperatures below 300\u00a0\u00b0C. The solubility of Sub-CW in hetero-PAHs\/PAHs can be correlated with the Gibbs solvation free energy of water dissolved in the oil phase and the cohesive energy density of the oil phase as parameters.\n               ","75":"\n                  Lost circulation is a great challenge during drilling and results in high financial costs. Despite the extensive advances in recent decades, lost circulation materials (LCMs) still have low success rates that fail to address lost circulation in fractured formations. This study proposes a novel temperature-responsive adhesive lost circulation material (TALCM) to control such losses. TALCMs consist of bridging and adhesive LCMs, which can be activated by formation heat. Once activated, the surfaces of the adhesive LCMs bond to the bridging LCMs through interdiffusion and entanglement of polymer chains. First, the thermodynamic properties of three kinds of thermoplastic resins were studied, namely low-density polyethylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and polyamide 6. Then, one of these resins was chosen as the adhesive LCM for its better adhesive and viscoelastic properties. Finally, a series of experiments was conducted on the plugging efficiencies of TALCMs. The results show that TALCMs achieve adhesive plugging when activated by formation heat during lost circulation control. The maximum pressure-bearing capacity of a TALCM was observed to be 14\u00a0MPa, with the compressive strength being higher than those of conventional bridging LCMs (7.5\u00a0MPa) when plugging a 1-mm-wide slot. More importantly, TALCMs can control severe lost circulation that the conventional LCMs or crosslinking polymers cannot address.\n               ","76":"\n                  Humic substances and salts are widely distributed in marine sediments, a phenomenon that undoubtedly increases the complexity of recovering methane from hydrate. In this work, kinetic experiments were carried out to determine the role of fulvic acid (FA) on methane hydrate formation and decomposition in marine sediments. We used the mixed clay-rich silty with pore water, containing 3.0\u00a0wt% NaCl, to simulate the sediments, with experimental pressure (12.7\u201314.6\u00a0MPa) and temperature (8.6\u201316.2\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions adopted from the hydrate reservoir of Shenhu area, South China Sea (SHCS). Results revealed that FA has favorable\/unfavorable effects on methane hydrate formation in the sediments, in a concentration-dependent manner. FA solutions, at concentrations of 6.0 and 10.0\u00a0wt%, inhibited the formation of methane hydrate, because the high-water holding capacity itself could reduce water activity. Conversely, 2.0\u00a0wt% FA solution accelerated methane hydrate formation by arranging surrounding water molecules with H-bonds. Interestingly, it was found that the addition of FA could significantly weaken NaCl's inhibitory effect on methane hydrate formation, while water conversion ratios increased \u223c2\/3-fold relative to NaCl without FA solution containing systems. These results suggested that presence of FA in marine sediments promoted hydrate reformation during reservoir production. Besides, we found that there is a synergistic effect between FA and NaCl in the process of methane decomposition.\n               ","77":"\n                  The accurate characterization of capillary pressure is essential in determining multiphase flow behavior in subsurface conditions.

This setting is a determining factor in the organic matter content. Geochemical pyrolysis, palynofacies, biomarkers, and carbon isotope analyses were conducted on 152 samples from 27 oil wells. The formation represents a regressive cycle deposited in a shallow carbonate ramp that was under clastic influence from the nearby land. Based on pyrolysis analyses, the source rocks have poor to excellent hydrocarbon potential. The kerogen types of the Yamama source are varied, including II, II\/III, III, and I.

A non-uniform fracture width model considering the nonlinear deformation of fracture and the embedment of proppant pillars is established. Then, an improved model based on LBM-CFD is proposed to simulate the flow field within the fracture and calculate the fracture conductivity. Finally, parametric analysis is carried out to understand the effects of closure stress, elastic modulus of the reservoir rock, proppant pillar's shape and proppant pillar's spacing on fracture width and conductivity. The results showed that the conductivity decreases gradually with closure stress and increases with elastic modulus. The proppant pillar with the smallest shape ratio can provide the highest conductivity. When the ratio of the proppant pillar's diameter to spacing is about 0.5, the conductivity for channel fracturing is best. The time of proppant-laden fluid (PLF) pulse and proppant-free fluid (PFF) pulse are the keys to the successful implementation of channel fracturing. The simulation results have been applied to the optimization of the pulse time in Shengli Oilfield. The field application proves that channel fracturing design based on our method could result in a large increase in well production.

The proposed framework consists of a machine learning based (ML-based) reconstruction method for small-scale porous media and an adjustable splicing algorithm to achieve the REVs reconstruction. On this basis, four special neural networks are established to reconstruct the porous media and ensure the connectivity between the adjacent porous media during the splicing process.

Depleted shale gas reservoirs with high adsorption capacities, excellent sealing properties, and complete infrastructure are potential sites for CO2 storage. However, hydraulic fracturing and extensive CO2 injection can result in fault reactivation, leading to CO2 migration and an increased risk of environmental contamination. Given this problem, a partially permeable boundary is introduced to characterize permeable faults. Herein, a novel methodology based on rate transient analysis that considers CO2 adsorption, diffusion, and leakage is proposed for evaluating the CO2 storage capacity of depleted shale gas reservoirs. The analytical solution for a multiple fractured horizontal well with finite conductivity is derived from the principle of potential superposition, Laplace transform, and correction functions. Subsequently, according to the analytical solutions, a rapid and robust CO2 storage capacity assessment technique is established. Using field data of the Marcellus shale, a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the effects of the reservoir and well parameters on the injection performance, carbon storage potential, and CO2 leakage risk. The results indicate that the proposed model is consistent with previously reported semi-analytical models and numerical simulations. The injection rate and cumulative leakage ratio increase with the leakage ratio, resulting in gas migration and an increased risk of leakage. Reservoirs with large drainage radii, high Langmuir volumes, and small Langmuir pressures are suitable for carbon sequestration, significantly increasing the adsorption capacity and reducing the leakage risk.

Data were collected from various experimental studies conducted at high-flow rates through different proppant packs and using different experimental procedures. The study was conducted in order to validate the Barree and Conway (2004), which yields accurate flow predictions across all flow regimes in porous media. This study examines output data such as pressures, temperature, and mass flow rate given a proppant pack design and specific flowing fluid.

If the CO2-rich IWG could be used directly or after simple treatment for underground storage and replacement, then clean utilization of CO2-rich IWG will certainly be promoted. In this paper, the feasibility of CO2-rich IWG for underground storage and replacement in carbonate gas reservoirs was studied from the perspective of gas adsorption characteristics. Firstly, the reliability of the molecular model was verified by fitting Monte Carlo simulation data of four representative gases with isothermal adsorption experimental data. Then, molecular dynamics simulation was used to study the adsorption mechanism of various components on the calcite surface in CO2-rich IWG. Finally, the competitive adsorption mechanism between CO2-rich IWG and methane, and the multi-component competitive mechanism between dominant gases are studied. The results show that the adsorption capacity of each component on calcite surface is HF\u00a0>\u00a0CO2>SO2>H2S\u00a0>\u00a0NO2>CH4>CO. Hydrogen bond and electrostatic force are the main adsorption forces of HF. The electrostatic force between negatively charged atoms in the molecule and Ca2+ is the main adsorption force for CO2, SO2 and H2S. The weak van der Waals force is the main adsorption force for NO2, CH4 and CO. In the competitive systems, the absolute adsorption capacity of CO2-rich IWG is reduced by 25\u201350% compared with single component adsorption. However, in the competitive adsorption systems of HF\/CH4, CO2\/CH4, H2S\/CH4 and SO2\/CH4, the relative adsorption capacity of the four industrial waste gases to methane is increased by 9 times, 5.5 times, 4 times and 3.75 times as compared with the non-competitive ones. In the competitive adsorption systems of HF\/CH4, CO2\/CH4, H2S\/CH4, and SO2\/CH4 the negatively charged atoms are more likely to combine with Ca2+ to generate strong electrostatic attraction, while generating electrostatic repulsion to the negatively charged C atoms in CH4, leading to the weakening or even disappearance of CH4 adsorption.

The results show that the pore size distribution of coal hardly changed with the change in axial stress, while 45.26% of the micropores and small pores were transformed into mesopores and macropores with the increase in adsorbed gas content within the tested range. Due to different microdeterioration mechanisms, the strength and elastic modulus of gas-bearing coal do not obey a single damage evolution criterion, and their deterioration rates with increasing adsorbed gas content were 27.96% and 11.20%, respectively, within the tested range. The trends of the variations in strength deterioration rate, fracture fractal dimension and pore volume fractal dimension of gas-bearing coal were consistent, and their correlations were greater than 99.2%, but the degrees of the changes in these factors were quite different, indicating that the damage factor at the macroscale cannot be extended to the microscale.

Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), a kind of ensemble learning, is demonstrated as one state-of-the-art solver for a variety of regression issue, and therefore can be regarded as a potential candidate to address the fitting of permeability via some logs. However, for this model, as the embedded exclusive feature bundling (EFB) algorithm appears incompatibly to logging data and meanwhile a great deal of hyper-parameters are employed during the training, a raw usage of LightGBM seems to be ineffective for a logging-based permeability regression. Thus, continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) and artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) are adopted as assistants to enhance the predicting capability of LightGBM, which will respectively deal with the transition of input logs and the optimization of hyper-parameters. Accordingly, a new hybrid predictor for the permeability fitting is proposed and named as CRBM-AFSA-LightGBM. To further verify the working performance, robustness, and generalization of the new predictor, the dataset collected from the tight sandstone reservoirs of member of Chang 4\u00a0+\u00a05, Ordos Basin, Northern China, is applied to implement a validation. Simultaneously, to highlight the validating effect, two sophisticated fitting models, support vector regression (SVR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), are introduced as competitors. To fairly conduct the designed competitions, the integration of CRBM and AFSA also will be embedded in SVR and XGBoost, and then the real forms of two competitors are CRBM-AFSA-SVR and CRBM-AFSA-XGBoost. Given a comprehensive analysis of the gained experimental results, four points are summarized as the critical conclusion: 1) compared to SVR-cored predictor, the closer permeability results fitted by XGBoost-cored and LightGBM-cored predictors are proved more reliable, but the latter hybrid model only averagely spends 1\/23 shorter times on the regression, hence argued as a higher-efficient fitting solver for the permeability of sand-mud reservoirs; 2) training more learning samples is testified effectively to raise an enhancement on the predicting capability of LightGBM-cored predictor, and then the application of a larger-volumetric learning dataset is encouraged during the training; 3) LightGBM-cored predictor will perform worse under the employment of a learning dataset derived from different study zone, thereby presenting an undesirable generalization, while such unsatisfactory predicting circumstance can be improved if more samples are learned during the establishment of input-output mapping; 4) since LightGBM-cored predictor has the capability to figure out the reasonable permeability outcomes even utilizing a sparse learning dataset, a strong robust nature is demonstrated for CRBM-AFSA-LightGBM.\n               ","89":"\n                  Because of their effectiveness in identifying geologic features, seismic attributes are usually used as input to machine learning (ML) models for facies classification.

Microseismic evidence indicates that the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) may have originated in the overlap region created by multi-well fracturing. However, the majority of SRV modeling studies have concentrated on a single well, ignoring the interference from offsetting wells. In this study, a novel model for modeling the SRV and multiwell horizontal pad in unconventional reservoirs is developed using an effective semi-analytical method. The proposed semi-analytical model is capable of simulating the behaviors of a multiwell horizontal pad with an irregularly shaped SRV and an impermeable boundary. The transient pressure behaviors of the multiwell horizontal pad with SRV are significantly different than that of a single isolated well, as demonstrated by the results. The linear flow between wells, the pseudoradial flow (PRF) of the multiwell pad in SRV, the transitional flow, and the final pseudoradial flow (PRF) of the multiwell pad all correspond to an extremely unusual transient pressure response. Due to the high flow capability of SRV, pressure diffusion occurs at a faster rate, resulting in the appearance of these flow regions in advance. Sensitivity analysis confirms that as the scale of SRV increases, the duration of the flow influenced by the SRV increases. The SRV and compensating wells result in a negligible PRF, while the pressure behaviors exhibit a gradual rise. This phenomenon may serve as a demonstration of the extremely rare occurrence of radial flow or PRF in unconventional reservoirs. The horizontal line value for the PRF in SRV is proportional to the total production of the well pad. The horizontal line value for the final PRF is also related to the unstimulated region's mobility ratio, the well pad's production rate and 0.5.

For an optimal exploitation of the reservoir fluids, it is necessary to introduce advanced digital tools and account for geological uncertainty when making decisions. This paper discusses an ensemble-based probabilistic decision-making workflow for closed-loop reservoir management. The reservoir model is a synthetic but realistic model with oil, gas, and water. We show how to use ensemble methods in a workflow for integrated uncertainty prediction, history matching, and robust optimization. The workflow uses advanced ensemble-based history-matching techniques to update a reservoir model in the annual maturation process. After the history-matching update, an optimization process decides the best wells to drill next to gain the highest net present value. An additional robust decision step evaluates the wells over the ensemble of reservoir models to ensure they lead to a positive ensemble-averaged net present value.

These models have many practical applications such as calculating the time for sand to settle and designing separators and setting tanks. To visually observe and record the sand settlement process, transparent industrial white oil is used to simulate heavy oil in this study. The settling of individual particles of sand under the gravity force is experimentally studied, and drag coefficients are determined.

The results are analyzed to explore the influence of sand particle morphology on the prediction of drag coefficients. Two dimensionless settling velocity models are established and used to analyze the behavior of sand particles in heavy oil; the results prove the reliability and applicability of the settling velocity model. In this study, a nonspherical particle drag coefficient model has no advantage over a spherical particle drag coefficient model in terms of prediction accuracy. Thus, it is not necessary to consider the influence of sand particle morphology when making predictions of the characteristic parameters of sand sedimentation in heavy oil.

However, fracture conductivity under a sparse distribution of rod proppants is rarely investigated theoretically, and the existing spherical model cannot be used owing to the different shapes of proppants.\n                  Based on the contact mechanisms between cylinders, deformation and embedment models of rod proppants are developed to calculate the fracture width. To solve the problem of sparse distribution, the axial and radial distance coefficients between rod proppants are defined, and a dimensionless permeability model is derived. Finally, a model for fracture conductivity under a rod proppant is developed based on the fracture width and permeability models. The model can predict the fracture conductivity when a rod proppant is used during pulse fracturing.\n                  The results show that in both the radial and axial flow directions, the fracture conductivity under radial proppant spacing is higher than that under axial proppant spacing, and the radial optimal proppant spacing is smaller than that the axial optimal proppant spacing. A critical proppant spacing exists that reverses the fracture conductivity. A larger radial proppant spacing renders it more difficult to obtain an axial optimal proppant spacing. This phenomenon is particularly evident when the closure pressure and proppant size are increased. Increasing the fracture width and improving the radial distribution of the rod proppant can effectively improve the fracture conductivity.

This article presents a comprehensive review of the status of research on the use of nanoparticles in drilling fluid in the aspect of filtration and formation damage, highlighting the experimental techniques, the influence of different critical variables on particle bridging and permeability alteration, recent advances, technical challenges, and directions for future works. Results from previous studies showed that several critical parameters such as size, concentration, type, and surface properties of nanoparticles play important role in controlling drilling fluid filtration. In general, engineering drilling fluid with nanoparticles would improve the drilling fluid filtration with exception of several nanoparticle types such as copper, aluminium, and zinc. Despite that, the optimum size and concentration have yet to be found which leads to many discrepancies. A review of the effect of surface properties suggests a strong relationship between surface charges and the filtration properties of drilling fluid.

Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian and Eulerian\u2013Eulerian methods are two commonly used numerical methods.

To date, only a few laboratory experiments have been conducted using supercritical CO2 directly to carry the proppant. In this study, an experimental system was designed to allow investigation of supercritical CO2 transport of proppants within a fracture. To determine the supercritical CO2 transport proppant mechanism and the impact of key operational variables, a series of laboratory experiments were performed considering various pumping schemes. The results demonstrate that the mechanism of supercritical CO2 transport proppant includes various flow patterns such as scouring, throwing and fluidization, among which fluidization is the key to the further migration of proppant. Continued injection of clear-fluid after the addition of proppant is complete, will help the dunes extend deeper into the fracture. Fluid velocity has a significant effect on supercritical CO2 transport proppant. While under the premise of constant mass flow rate, increasing the injection temperature, decreasing the injection pressure or reducing the proppant concentration will make the dune equilibrium height lower and the dune laying distance longer. Meanwhile, small-sized proppant particles can still be easily lifted and suspended in supercritical CO2, and reducing proppant size significantly increases the transportability. Furthermore, dune equilibrium height correlates significantly with the variation of the Reynolds number of the fluid flow. Therefore, from a practical field operation point of view, using Reynolds number as a controlling parameter seems to be a viable option for selection of optimum pumping operational variables and prediction of proppant migration within the fracture. The results of this study are expected to provide guidance for field operators to better design operational variables (e.g. CO2 injection rates, proppant load and pumping schedule, etc.) used for supercritical CO2 fracturing.\n               ","99":"\n                  The article discusses the problems of asphaltene, resin and paraffin deposition and paraffin control methods in an oil production well.

We studied the multi-dimensional imbibition characteristics by establishing numerical simulation models considering nine boundary conditions. On the basis of the capillary diffusion equation of counter-current imbibition, the equations of normalized oil recovery versus imbibition time were obtained under different boundary conditions. Then, we derived a new shape factor by processing and comparing these equations. The results show that the relationship between front distance and imbibition time of 2D and 3D models is different from that of 1D models. The shape factor for the multi-dimensional counter-current imbibition processes is time-dependent and varies with normalized recovery, which is also the reason for the difficulty of using a constant shape factor to scale imbibition data.

WBE can cause serious damages to the low-permeability reservoir but has not been paid sufficient attention to in CBM studies. To enhance understanding of the dynamic WBE in the multiphase flow process, we conducted core flooding experiments on two typical Chinese bituminous coal and anthracite coal samples. During the flooding experiments, real-time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the change of water signal in the core were used to calculate the gas-water relative permeability and to evaluate the dynamic WBE. The results highlight that a more pronounced WBE occurred in anthracite coal compared with bituminous coal.

The results reveal that the water-blocking TPGs for both samples follow a positive power-law relationship with the normalized water saturation. The water-blocking TPG is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of the conventional gas TPG. A high water-blocking TPG value reflects stronger gas\/water interference during multiphase flow, exerting a negligible impact on the gas migration through the coalbed, which should be prioritized in CBM production.

The weathered and fresh basalt zones were integrated with permeable zones to identify four reservoir facies (Fractured basalt, Massive basalt, Weathered basalt having permeability, and Weathered Basalt with no permeability) in the studied wells. The micro resistivity image data proved to be of great help in identifying vesicular and brecciated basalt facies along with weathered\/fractured basalt and the conventional log signatures of these basalt facies were standardized in this study. Two sets of natural fractures were also identified from resistivity image data in Deccan basalts. The main trend has strike orientation in NE-SW and the other set in NW-SE direction.

Accurate assessment of PIPR is very important for polymer selection to define the relative merits of polymer flooding for a certain reservoir and avoid polymer injectivity loss during field operations. A severe PIPR can be due to excessive polymer retention inside the reservoir rock, fluid incompatibility of polymer with formation fluids and rocks, clogging of pore throats (accumulation of large polymer molecules at the pore throat), shear thickening due to high shear rate in the near-wellbore area, Improper preparation of the polymer solution, and bad quality of the injection brine used to prepare the polymer solution.\n                  In this paper, coreflooding as an assessment technique for PIPR is reviewed and a new interpretation technique is presented to correlated the polymer retention to permeability reduction measured from coreflooding experiments.

The specific energy for breaking the rock mainly comes from the impact energy. To increase the drilling efficiency, the propelling pressure should be set maximally in its reasonable threshold but the percussive pressure is not the higher the better.\n               ","112":"\n                  Casing deformation is a severe problem in shale gas well development. The field data show that multiple deformations usually occur in the same casing well, and the distance is close, and the degree of deformation is different. In this paper, firstly, based on the distribution of micro-seismic event points in the Ning M well, the fracture group is inverted, and to establish the finite element numerical model to simulate the multi-stage fracturing, Then, the stress at each point of the casing is analyzed with the fracturing time, the circumferential stress at each point after fracturing and the axial stress of casing, and the displacement variation of casing in the directions of maximum, minimum and vertical principal stress are discussed. Finally, the effect of the intensive fracturing technology on controlling casing deformation is discussed. The results show that: a) Casing stress increases in different amplitude at a local point, circumferential direction, an axial direction, and regional stress difference is formed; b) Some local areas around the wellbore are subjected to twice or more re-fractures, and the corresponding rock properties (such as elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio) will change differently; c) Casing deformations with different directions and displacements appear in some reconstructed areas, showing \u201cS\u201d shape deformation, consistent with the actual deformation situation on site; d) The intensive fracturing technology can alleviate the non-uniformity of fracturing and reduce the non-uniform load of the casing, and effectively reduce the casing deformation rate after field application.\n               ","113":"\n                  Refracturing is one of the most effective techniques to enhance the production of tight sandstone gas (TSG) well. Many TSG gas wells are facing the problem of water invasion after refracturing, the formation water may gradually occupy the gas-producing channels, preventing high gas productivity. In this paper, we newly developed a fuzzy-ball temporary plugging fluid (FTPF) with diverting fractures and water cutting after refracturing in one operation. The temporary plugging and water breakthrough control capabilities of the FTPF system were evaluated through the true triaxial large-scale core diversion fracturing experiment and matrix core and artificial fracture waterproof experiments. Meanwhile, the permeability damage evaluation experiments were performed to analyze the reservoir recovery ability. Results showed that the pressure-bearing capacity could reach up to 62.6\u00a0MPa, the rock fracture pressure was increased by 5\u201310\u00a0MPa compared with the initial hydraulic fracturing and an apparent fracture network structure was formed after refracturing. The breakthrough pressure gradients of simulated formation water were 2\u201310 times higher than that of nitrogen after the cores (including matrix and cores with 4\u00a0mm fractures) were plugged with FTPF, indicating its good water cutting ability. Before and after gel breaking, the permeability recovery value of the matrix core and the artificial fracture core was about 85\u201398%. The on-site application of FTPF to the refracturing of two TSG wells in the Sulige Gas Field in Northwest of China displayed that the average gas production has been enhanced by 64.8%. It is proposed that fuzzy balls can easily enter and gather at the tip of the initial fractures and form a stable pressure-bearing structure due to its viscoelastic properties and deformability. In addition, the hydrophilic fuzzy-ball core agents can adsorb on the rock's surface and form a polymer membrane, increasing the resistance of water flow.\n               ","114":"\n                  Exploration campaigns focusing on Paleozoic plays in the Egyptian north Western Desert Sallum and Faghur basins have been limited to date, and little has been done to investigate their hydrocarbon generation potential. A total of 284 shale, calcareous shale, coaly shale and siltstone side-wall core and cuttings samples, covering the rock succession that ranges from the Silurian Kohla Formation to the Turonian Abu Roash Formation were analyzed for source rock potential. In addition, eight reservoired Paleozoic\u2013Mesozoic oil samples were geochemically analyzed. This paper systematically investigates (1) organic enrichment, hydrocarbon generation potential, and thermal maturity of Mesozoic as well as possible Paleozoic source rocks, and (2) composition and biomarker characteristics of crude oil samples in the study area from the far north Western Desert basins of Egypt.\n                  The Silurian Kohla and Basur and the Carboniferous Desouqy and Dhiffah siltstone and shale rock samples show overall poor and fair to good source rock potential for the Lower and Upper Cretaceous rock units, respectively. In contrast, high TOC (up to 4.83\u00a0wt%) and Rock-Eval S2 (up to 6.57\u00a0mg HC\/g rock) for the Devonian Zeitoun Formation samples indicates fair to very good source potential. The Middle Jurassic Khatatba Formation samples, compared with the Devonian Zeitoun Formation or other rock units in the stratigraphic column of the study area, have the highest TOC (30.1\u00a0wt%) and the highest S2 (26.9\u00a0mg HC\/g rock), indicating fair to excellent source rock potential. These high values of the Khatatba Formation are locally related to organic-rich coaly shales and calcareous shale intervals. The Rock-Eval results indicate an overall dominance of Type-III kerogen with strongly varying OI values. This highly gas-prone character for most samples was confirmed petrographically by abundant vitrinite phytoclasts and recycled organic matter. Coals and coaly shale facies from the Alam El Bueib and Khatatba formations that contain liptinitic materials may represent Type-III kerogens that are capable of generating gas with minor oil. Based on Rock-Eval Tmax and HI results, the Zeitoun and Khatatba samples range from early to peak oil window. This is consistent with the Ro measurements of the Paleozoic Zeitoun samples (0.65\u20131.02%) and the Middle Jurassic Khatatba samples (0.59\u20131.01%).\n                  The Faghur oils are light (35\u00b0\u201346\u00b0 API gravity), belong to a single genetic family and are non-biodegraded based on wide-ranging n-alkanes. Abundant tricyclic diterpanes, C24 tetracyclic terpane, C27 Ts trisnorneohopane, diahopane, cyclohexanes, C29 steranes and rearranged steranes and low to very low gammacerane and extended hopanes are common molecular signatures of the analyzed light oil and condensate samples. These findings indicate a relatively oxic fluvio-deltaic environment for the corresponding clay-rich coaly shale and calcareous shale source rocks that contain predominantly higher land-plants with negligible algal\/bacterial organic materials. Based on saturated- and aromatic-maturity parameters, the analyzed oils were inherited from peak\u2013late mature source rock.\n               ","115":"\n                  Asphaltenes are the heaviest compound group in crude oil. The complex and porous macromolecular network of asphaltenes both adsorbs and occludes small hydrocarbon molecules, which are considered source-related petroleum biomarkers as they are shielded from secondary alterations. The current method to isolate the occluded content involves mild oxidative degradation of asphaltenes with CH3COOH\/H2O2, but it is generally not suitable for quantitative studies, as side reactions that chemically alter the bound hydrocarbons are difficult to mitigate. In the current study, we compared the performance of dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) and mild oxidative degradation in isolating asphaltene-occluded hydrocarbons, using Lower Cambrian solid bitumen from northwestern Sichuan and Ordovician crude oil from the Tazhong area of Xinjiang, China. We demonstrated that DSPE was effective in extracting occluded hydrocarbons from asphaltene aggregates without undesirable chemical alterations, thereby allowing subsequent quantitative analysis. Further investigations revealed that the chemical composition of the occluded n-alkanes provided useful information with regard to the origin of the petroleum. Importantly, the enrichment of aromatic hydrocarbons inside the asphaltene aggregates, particularly the relative abundance of different methylphenanthrene isomers, provided crucial experimental evidence in support of our earlier hypothesis that the occluded hydrocarbons were protected from secondary alterations, and therefore had remained relatively stable over a long geologic period.\n               ","116":"\n                  Precipitation of paraffin wax during crude oil transportation in low ambient temperature presents many technological challenges in petroleum industries. During a complete shutdown, the precipitation intensifies to form a gel-like structure which usually demands high restart pressure during flow restart operation. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the gelation process in the shutdown pipeline and subsequent non-isothermal flow start-up operation in a heterogeneously gelled pipeline. A Finite volume method is used to solve the mass, momentum and energy conservation-based governing equations over an orthogonal static grid setup. The gelation model utilizes a modified Eyring-based viscosity model to account for temperature-dependent changes in gel strength. On the other hand, the flow restart process follows the deformation and temperature-dependent shear-thinning based rheological model. The pipeline under consideration in the present work is vertical, replicating flow in risers. Our gelation model considers natural convection-driven flow inside the pipeline, which incites the hot oil in the core to mix with cooler fluid at the wall. The gelation is achieved through cooling the static crude oil in the pipeline for different timespans varying from 3\u00a0h to 15\u00a0h. The gelation stage ends up producing spatial heterogeneity in gel strength. Such heterogeneity leads to weaker gel structure in the core causing early flow restart due to cohesive failure of the gel medium at some interior radial location. Hence, it can be concluded that depending on the cooling stage, the heterogeneous gel with a weaker gel in the pipe core can restart faster than when the pipeline is filled with the gel having an equivalent average temperature. The findings provide realistic insights into the mechanism of gel failure in the pipeline, and the knowledge can be utilized to develop a better flow assurance strategy.\n               ","117":"\n                  A \u201cpass-by\u201d (also known as a \u201cfly by\u201d) is performed during the locate phase in a relief well when using the magnetic ranging technique to realise triangulation for reducing the relative borehole uncertainty. The pass-by from the relief well to the target well is essential for fixing the target well in a relative 3D space. In triangulation model, the projections of the observed points in the pass-by phase are treated as one point on the O-NE plane because the target well trajectory is considered vertical; the point is observed by ranging shots in different directions in the pass-by phase. The least square method is applied to improve the uncertainty resulting from active magnetic ranging because of the redundant observations of the observed point. However, the triangulation model omits the uncertainty between the fix points resulting from the wellbore position uncertainty. In practice, the trajectory of the target well is not strictly vertical, and occasionally, the observed points cannot be treated as one point on the O-NE plane. Currently, a verification method for model correctness remains lacking. Therefore, in this study, a new geometric model is applied using the analysis results of the pass-by phase and relative borehole uncertainty results obtained from ranging and traditional inclinometer tools. In this model, the observed points are not treated as one point, and therefore, the redundant observations of each observed point are executed using ranging and traditional inclinometer tools. The least square method is applied to improve the relative borehole uncertainty, and a statistic test is conducted to confirm the validity of the proposed and the triangulation models. Two other statistical tests are applied to determine whether the uncertainty between fix points could be omitted. A flow chart is also employed to ensure that the fix points were reasonably determined. A comparison of the results of the proposed and traditional triangulation models indicates that the proposed model achieves validity with a larger measured depth between fix points compared to that for the triangulation model. Further, the well position uncertainty is introduced in this model, and the relative borehole uncertainty is reduced. This study therefore presents a theoretical basis for the design of survey plans in the pass-by phase.\n               ","118":"\n                  Unconventional oil and gas resources are important and have recently attracted attention. High temperature stimulation can effectively release the damage of water phase trapping, which was caused during the drilling and completion of hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs. The changes of physical and mechanical properties of shale under high temperature is of significance to the safety and efficiency of hydraulic fracturing. This study investigated the effect of temperature on seismic velocity, porosity, permeability, and mixed-mode fracture toughness of shale. Shale samples are separated into two groups, one group of 12 samples to test porosity, permeability and velocity, and the second group of 12 samples to test the fracture toughness of shale. The results showed that as the temperature increased, the color of the shale sample lightened, and seismic velocity decreased while the permeability and porosity increased. The results also revealed that as the temperature was raised to 400\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C, seismic velocity, shale permeability, and porosity all increased. Furthermore, the mixed-mode fracture toughness was reduced, indicating that the threshold temperature of the shale was around 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The threshold value obtained can provide a basis for field evaluation and the potential application of high-temperature treatment. A numerical model was developed to simulate fracture propagation in SCB (semi-circular bend) samples subjected to thermal treatment. The numerical simulation agreed with the experimental results, indicating that the high temperature promoted fracture propagation and had a higher stress concentration at the fracture tip.\n               ","119":"\n                  For the effective exploration and development of shale gas, it is important to understand the transport and adsorption mechanisms of methane, the main composition of shale gas. The wide variety of mineral components in shale matrices makes the pore surface complex, causing difficulty to understand the mass transport and adsorption behaviors within shale pores. Molecular dynamics (MD) have high fidelity to simulate the domains with complex geometries at nanoscale. However, most of the previous MD studies focused on the mechanisms of methane in slit nanopores, which could not reflect the real adsorption and transport behaviors of shale gas in nanopores with complex structures. This work studied the fluid properties in shale nanopores with high relative roughness and complex boundary geometries. The graphene sheets with different geometrical structures are used to characterize the complex boundary of shale pores. In addition, the effects of temperature, pressure, driving force, relative roughness, and absolute roughness on the adsorption and transport behaviors are investigated. In this study, shale gas diffusion is developed by the Einstein method to calculate the spatial diffusion coefficient D, planar diffusion coefficient D\n                     xy, and vertical diffusion coefficient D\n                     z of gas molecules to quantify and analyze the effects of temperature and pressure on shale gas diffusion. The results indicate that the main diffusion mechanism of methane is planar diffusion. Diffusion coefficients are sensitive to temperature and pressure changes for rarefied gases. Then, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method is carried out to investigate the adsorption behavior. The simulation results show that the adsorption density increases with the increase of pressure and the decrease of temperature. The pressure-driven flow behavior of methane in nanopores is investigated by using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). The results indicate that the flow velocity of methane increases with the driving force. Moreover, the rough elements near wall dampen the transport of methane molecules.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"","1":"","2":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMatrix and fracture acidizing are effective methods to achieve higher production rates like the other available stimulation techniques in carbonate oil and gas reservoirs (Morales and Diaz, 2017). Acids dissolve induced skin and increase the permeability of the near wellbore region by dissolving the rock by which opens the plugged pores by fines and\/or in carbonated reservoirs creates penetrable channels called wormhole (Asaadian et al., 2017a). Matrix acidizing is typically designed in three different stages: pre-flush, main treatment, and over-flush. The rock surface of formation is prepared for a more efficient acid\/rock reaction during the pre-flush stage (Karimi et al., 2018). The formation fluid is pushed back by the nonreactive fluid from the damaged zone to the reservoir. This stage has a critical effect on the formation of sludge and emulsion during the main treatment stage of stimulation. The success of any stimulation operation depends on the accurate prediction of the sub-surface condition during the acidizing treatment (Asaadian and Soulgani, 2016; Abdollahi and Shadizadeh, 2012). Before acidizing execution, final studies on the spreading of the wormhole, fluid viscosity alteration, possible further treatment damages must be carried out. To this end, the knowledge of formation damage mechanisms, acid treatment and chemicals are required for a successful acidizing plan (McLeod, 1984; Garrouch and Jennings, 2017).\nHydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used as the base treatment fluid in carbonate reservoirs and while forms a mixture with hydrofluoric acid (HF), it has the same application in formations with sandstone rock type (Wong et al., 1996, 1997; Xie et al., 2005; Shafiq and Mahmud, 2017). After acid injection into the formation, the interaction between crude oil and acid cause two major damages named asphaltic sludge and rigid-film emulsion. Moore et al., 1965 studied the reason and the probability of sludge formation by conducting several laboratory experiments and examined stabilizing agents as prevention solution method (Moore et al., 1965). These two forms of acid stimulation damages cause rock wettability alteration, pore plugging and phase trapping (Garrouch et al., 2006; Houchin et al., 1990; Aghajanzadeh et al., 2019). Furthermore, formed asphaltic sludge in the near wellbore makes the clean-up slower resulting in the disruption in oil production (Jacobs and Thorne, 1986).\nAsphaltene, one of the main elements in forming the induced sludge process, is defined as the heaviest component of crude oil with high polarity and active surface with solubility in aromatic solvents such as toluene, benzene and insoluble in alkanes (Asaadian et al., 2017b; Ahmadi et al., 2019a; Azari et al., 2018). Asphaltene molecules are made of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon rings with peripheral alkane chains (Ahmadi et al., 2019b; Langevin and Argillier, 2016). Limited percentage of heteroatoms like N, O and S exist in the polyaromatic asphaltene molecules with paraffinic rings, alkyl linkage and aliphatic side chains decorating them. The following main functional groups are defined for existing heteroatoms. S: thiophene, sulfidric, sulfoxide; N: pyrrolic, pyridine, quinoline; and O: hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl. Also, the brownish-black color of asphaltene molecules reflects the extended conjugation of aromatic structure (Adams, 2014; Shahsavani et al., 2019).\nAccording to the charge of acid-base pairs, they may exist in the asphaltene molecules, normally between oxygen and the functional groups containing nitrogen. Metal porphyrins or related chelating metal structures are also present. The majority of these metal compounds are coordination complexes containing vanadium, nickel, and iron. Porphyrins (and metal complexes in general) are proven to contribute to fouling and are highly enriched in asphaltene deposits, despite their modest concentration. They are particularly troublesome as they can cross-link and become entrapped within asphaltene supramolecular structures, making them difficult to remove (Olayiwola and Dejam, 2019; Ayirala et al., 2006).\nSeveral additives are used along with acids to prevent further damage due to unwanted possible reactions with equipment, rock and reservoir fluids and decrease the risk of sludge deposition in the pipelines (Weidner, 2011; Rabie and Nasr-El-Din, 2015; Frenier and Hill, 2002). When asphaltic sludge is formed, it is insoluble in most treating chemicals expect toluene. Hence, sludge removal from the formation is not as easy as wellbore clean-up because of the difficulties caused by solvent injection into the formation (Campbell, 2002; Lu et al., 2021). Therefore, prevention of sludge formation is preferred to curing. Anti-sludge agents that are used to prevent sludge formation are mostly alkyl phenols, fatty acids and certain oil-soluble surface-active agents (Houchin et al., 1990). Similarly, ionic and non-ionic surfactants encourage to maintain the asphaltene molecules in the organic phase (Olayiwola and Dejam, 2019). On the other hand, the probability of sludge precipitation on the reservoir rock poses the rock wettability alteration toward oil-wetting condition that is considered as subsidiary damage (Kudrashou and Nasr-El-Din, 2019). In this case, surfactants are used to keep the wettability intact or become more water-wet and stabilize the asphaltene molecules in pre-flush stage and reduce oil\/water IFT in the main stage of the treatment (Taylor et al., 2003; Maley et al., 2015).\nMany research groups have attempted in various ways to prevent asphaltene molecules from being aggregated in order to stop forming the induced sludge (AlMubarak et al., 2015; Almubarak et al., 2021; Khurshid et al., 2022; Shirazi et al., 2019). An ester of sulfonic acid, including such monoethoxylated dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, was presented by Loony and McDougall in 1984 as an anti-sludge agent for acid stimulated hydrocarbon containing formations (Looney and McDougall, 1984). The compositions Dyer invented in 1997 contain an alkyl aryl sulfonic acid or salt thereof, a nonethoxylated glycol, and an acetylenic alcohol in an alkyl alcohol solvent. (Dyer, 1997). During acid treatment and stimulation of hydrocarbon wells, these compositions have proven to be helpful at controlling sludge and emulsion growth. Campbell (2002) invented certain formulations that involve the demulsification and liquification of hydrocarbon-based sludges (Campbell, 2002). The innovation aims to create a hydrocarbon-based sludge that is enough liquefied to be pumped and sufficiently demulsified to facilitate the separation of the sludge's waters, oils, and solids (Campbell, 2002). Knopp (2009) composition demonstrated the ability to either inhibit or prevent the formation of emulsions during acid stimulation of hydrocarbon wells. It consists of an alkyldiphenyl oxide sulfonic acid or derivative thereof, an acetylenic alcohol, and an alkyl diphenyl oxide sulfonic acid or derivative thereof, all in an alkyl alcohol solvent (Knopp, 2009). Fogler and Chang studied crude oil asphaltene stabilization in 1981. Several factors have been found to be influential in the amphiphile's ability to stabilize crude oil asphaltenes, including the polarity of the headgroup and the length of the alkyl tail (Chang and Fogler, 1994). Furthermore, a study by O'Nill et al. (2015) compared anionic and cationic anti-sludge agents. They found that anionic anti-sludge surfactants control acid-induced precipitation more effectively than other surfactants. Additionally, cationic anti-sludge surfactants prevent precipitation in a different manner than anionic surfactants (O'Neil et al., 2015). There are wide ranges of surfactants that are used in oil well acidizing for anti-sludge and demulsifier agents (Table 1\n) (Hashmi and Firoozabadi, 2013; Mirvakili et al., 2012).\nAdditionally, several studies have been conducted to address bio-surfactant application in the petroleum industry (Bognolo, 1999; PordelShahri et al., 2012; Ahmadi et al., 2015; Ahmadi and Shadizadeh, 2013; Deymeh et al., 2012). Initially, Pordel Shahri et al., 2012 introduced a new type of surfactant which was extracted from the leaves of Zizyphus spina-christi (PordelShahri et al., 2012). Abdollahi et al. studied henna as an anti-corrosion additive in the acidizing sandstone rock (Abdollahi and Shadizadeh, 2012). Despite existence of the long literature review, there is still a lack of understanding of the nature and mechanisms of acid-induced sludge formation and prevention. In this study, has been attempted to present a proper insight into sludge nature and propose a novel environment-friendly surfactant to prevent sludge damages during matrix acidizing particularly alteration of rock properties like wettability. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations were also carried out to provide a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the sludge occurrence and its remediation.\n\n\n2\nMaterial\nIn order to avoid a long passage, elaborating the procedures for all the experiments carried out in this paper, is provided in Supplementary Material (SM) (See Figs. S1\u2013S5). The used materials in this study are described in the following sections. Each experiment's measurements are performed three times, and the presented data is the average of the results from each campaign. The experimental error for each experiment is shown by error bars in related figure.\n\n2.1\nCrude oil\nThe crude oil used in these experiments was from Asmari formation, one of the south-West Iranian oil reservoirs which irrespective of its low specific gravity, has a considerable asphaltene content. SARA test analysis on dead oil showed that the values of saturation, aromatic, resin and asphaltene sub-fractions of oil were 53.5, 16.5, 12 and 18\u00a0wt%, respectively. Also, the concentration of Fe, Ni, V and Ca ions were 700, 93, 370 and 530\u00a0ppm, respectively. Extracted asphaltene is used to prepare synthetic oils with specific weight percent of asphaltene content by mixing with toluene. Asmari oil was chosen because the similar molecular structure was present in the published articles (Takanohashi et al., 2004; Sheremata et al., 2004). Two simulated molecular structures similar to described crude oil are illustrated in Fig. 1\nb and c.\n\n\n2.2\nNonionic bio-surfactant\nA bio-surfactant is extracted from the leaves of Zizyphus spina-christi shrub. It has a light-gray, cracked and scaly bark. Its leaf surface is also glabrous on top and finely pubescent below. It can be widely found in the Middle East especially in Iran, Iraq, Jordon, and Egypt. This plant-based material, which is a natural surface-active substance, was used as a surfactant in enhanced oil recovery research and also as shale swelling inhibitor in drilling studies previously conducted. However, utilizing this surfactant in matrix acidizing as anti-sludge has not yet been studied in the literature. Concentration of saponins, bio-surfactant, produced by more than 500 plant species, has been reported to be fairly high in leaves of Zizyphus spina-christi (PordelShahri et al., 2012; Stanimirova et al., 2011).\nFrom the butanol extract of the leaves of the Z. spina-christi, four saponin glycosides were isolated: Christinin A, B, C, and D. Their structures were confirmed by chemical and FT-IR spectroscopic evidence. Christinin A was found to be 3-O-\u03b1-Lfucopyranosyl\/\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl\/\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin. The others are new, Christinin B being 3-O-\u03b1-D-fucopyranosyl\/\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-4-sulfate\/alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin, Christinin C being 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranosyl\/\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl\/\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin, and Christinin D being 3-O-\u03b1-Lfucopyranosyl\/\u03b2-D-arabinopyranosyl\/\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl\/\u03b1-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin. The saponins molecules have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Triterpenoid and steroid or steroid-alkaloid are made hydrophobic part while the hydrophilic part is composed of saccharide residues. Both two parts are connected by glyco-side bonds (Stanimirova et al., 2011). Soxhlet apparatus is used to obtain soluble (in water and alcohol) dark brown powder with a density and pH value of 0.09 gr\/cm3 and 5.8 respectively (Ayirala et al., 2006). A schematic of saponin chemical structure is illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\n2.3\nThin sections\nThree series of fourteen thin-sections are prepared from sandstone, fractured, and vuggy carbonate rocks (total 42 thin-sections). In order to simulate the actual condition of the reservoir for testing, these rocks are collected from outcrop reservoir formation and aged separately with brine and dead oil. The semi-quantitative mineral compositions of the three rock sets are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) are provided in Table 2\n.\n\n\n\n2.4\nCommercial additives\nTwo common commercial additives (i.e., WA120 and NE32) which are frequently used in field matrix acidizing operations are prepared and compared with bio-surfactants. WA 120 has been mostly used in pre-flush stage to prevent wettability alteration during acidizing treatment, while NE32 is usually used during main treatment process as anti-sludge agent (McLeod, 1984; Garrouch and Jennings, 2017). All chemicals including n-heptane, toluene, and 37\u00a0wt% hydrochloric acid which are used in the following procedures, were provided from Merck Company.\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\n\n3.1\nCritical micelle concentration (CMC) measurement\nIn general, there are various methods for determining CMC; in this case, the conductivity approach was chosen. Because of the various degrees of surfactant ionization below and above the CMC, the conductivity trend of aqueous ionic surfactant solutions changes at the CMC. Surfactant monomers behave as strong electrolytes below the CMC and are slightly ionized above the micelles. The charge, mobility, and concentrations of all ions present in the solution are reflected in the specific conductance or conductivity (k) of the solution (Abdollahi and Shadizadeh, 2012). Concentrations of bio-surfactant ZSCE were varied from 0.5 to 9\u00a0wt% (1000\u201380,000\u00a0ppm). Conductivity of solutions was ranged from high concentration to low (Fig. 2\n). To determine the location of CMC, conductivity data are plotted against concentrations by which the turning point in the curve reveals the value of CMC. When concentration of surfactant solution increases to a certain value, its molecules will come to association reaction, and start to form micelles, hence a sharp change in trend of curve is observed (Fig. 2). Careful experimental measurements using highly purified systems revealed that somewhat gradual and continuous changes in physicochemical properties occurred near the CMC. The CMC value for bio-surfactant ZSCE was obtained round 3.32\u00a0wt%, which is used in experiments.\n\n\n3.2\nAdsorption experiment\nBatch equilibrium testing on carbonate minerals is used to measure surfactant adsorption on reservoir rock. A given volume of bio-surfactant solution at a known concentration is combined with a specified quantity of crushed rock in a centrifuge tube in these studies on crushed core. After 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h, samples of bio-surfactant solution were obtained from the container and residual concentration was determined using a conductivity meter. The system is in equilibrium and the test is completed when the concentration remains constant over time. Preliminary studies revealed that adsorption equilibrium could be established within 2\u00a0h (Fig. 3\n), which can be used to design aging experiments.\n\n\n3.3\npH and refractive index measurement\nIn optics, the propagation of light through the medium is described by the refractive index. This dimensionless parameter is defined as:\n\n(1)\n\n\nn\n=\n\nc\n\u028b\n\n\n\n\nWhere c is the light speed and \u028b is the light velocity in the medium. According to the definition of the refractive index, the existence of dispersed particles in medium increases the refractive index by lowering the speed of light through media (Singh, 2002). Therefore, this parameter is used to determine the concentration of asphaltene molecules in the solutions. Thus, by sampling a few amounts of prepared synthetic oils and determining their refractive index, an indicator and baseline are drawn to show the asphaltene content of oil with respect to their refractive index. Furthermore, after mixing the samples of synthetic oils with acid solutions, droplets of remaining oil were taken to identify their refractive index. Results are classified in four different lines with y-intercept equals to the pure toluene refractive index (=1.496 @ T\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C). These four lines are shown in Fig. 4\na. The amount of asphaltene molecules which reacted to from acid induced sludge were determined by comparing the percentage of asphaltene content for equal refractive indexes from synthetic oil line and HCl acid percentage line. This comparison shows that approximately 0.7, 0.6 and 0.4 are the values of the remained asphaltene ration (amount of remained asphaltene in oil\/amount of total asphaltene in oil) for HCl acid 10, 15 and 28\u00a0wt% respectively.\nIf the recorded refractive indexes are categorized by the percentage of solution asphaltene content, it will be obvious that the refractivity index increases with asphaltene content. The slope of the refractive index also decreases with an increase in the asphaltene content. Due to the high concentration of asphaltene in medium, the probability of reaction between acid and asphaltene molecules increases. The refractive indexes of remaining oils with asphaltene concentration of 3, 6 and 9\u00a0wt% reacted with HCl 28\u00a0wt% are very close to that of pure toluene. Thus, it shows that almost all the asphaltene molecules are trapped as sludge in the emulsion phase. The carried out tests on the de-asphalted crude oil to examine the role of other components of crude oil reflected no substantial changes in the respective refractive indexes. This fact reveals that asphaltene has the main role in the interaction of acid and oil because of its polarity and surface activity (Fig. 4b).\nIn addition, it was attempted to measure the effect of other oil components such as resins, saturates and aromatics. After preforming SARA test, each separated component was mixed with 15\u00a0wt% of hydrochloric acid and further reaction was observed by microscope. As Fig. 5\nb depicts, acid presence stimulates the asphaltene molecules to become dramatically unstable in the liquid phase followed by resin being less affected by the acid (Fig. 5c). Compression with earlier, the other two components remained stable in acidic environmental conditions (Fig. 5a and d).\nThe pH values of acid solutions before and after mixing with prepared synthetic oil samples are measured and presented in Fig. 6\n. As the amount of asphaltene in the synthetic oil samples rises, the pH value rises as well. Increased asphaltene content enhances the possibility of an acid-asphaltene molecule reaction, resulting in a higher pH value. The similar pattern can be seen at all HCl concentrations. However, for solutions with higher concentration of HCl, they experience stronger increasing in pH value after treatment because of higher acidity.\nSimilarly, variations in pH value before and after applying bio-surfactant were recorded, but no significant differences were found. Because ZSCE molecules bind to asphaltene, the most polar and surface-active sub-fraction of the oil component, they prevent acid from reacting with it. With almost the same pH value, the acid solution stayed intact.\n\n\n3.4\nFT-IR spectrum\nThe effect of the acid on asphaltene metallic elements, nickel and vanadium was also studied using FT-IR method. The experiment was performed by adding acid to the asphaltene, stirring the resulting mixture and then filtration of it. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the concentrations of V and Ni in acid (before and after addition to asphaltene), and the results are summarized in Table 3\n.\nAs can be seen in Table 3, in entry 2, after treatment of asphaltene with acid, the concentration of Ni decreased, and the concentration of V increased. This indicates that the treatment of the asphaltene with acid caused the V to be removed from asphaltene molecules, while some of the Ni in the acid was absorbed by these molecules. This difference can be attributed to the greater tendency of Ni in the formation of stable complexes with asphaltene molecules. The electronic structure of Ni, and its higher electron affinity than V are probably the reason of this big difference in the complex formation. As it is clear from Fig. 7\n, there are no important differences in the FT-IR spectrums of acid before and after treatment with asphaltene thus it can be concluded that no organic molecule was dissolved in acid during treatment with asphaltene molecules.\n\n\n3.5\nSludge volume measurement\nMeasured volume results indicate that sludge and emulsion volume is increased 113% by 28\u00a0wt% HCl acid while this value was 7% for 15\u00a0wt% HCl acid on average for all asphaltene concentrations. In fact, the formation of acid-induced sludge in high acid concentrations such as 28\u00a0wt% is significant. These values indicate the amount of sludge and formed emulsion at the interface between oil and water increases with asphaltene concentration. While results are recommended to use acid with low HCl concentration due to minor sludge formation, the strength of the acid solution must be sufficient to leave an appropriate influx through the matrix. Thus, the choice of 15\u00a0wt% HCl acid is a satisfactory option in routine jobs, however, the use of additives such as anti-sludge agents is crucial in operations.\nChanging the concentration of asphaltene in synthetic oil from 15\u00a0wt% to 20\u00a0wt% does not significantly increase the volume of acid-induced sludge phase. This fact indicates that most of the acid influence is impressed with asphaltene concentration less than 15\u00a0wt%. Above this concentration, the acid solution does not act as the same and the volume of the sludge remains much lower. These results are displayed in Fig. 8\na. Besides, the use of the both additives (i.e., commercial anti-sludge agent NE32 and bio-surfactant ZSCE) has prevented sludge formation so that no significant volume of sludge has been observed even in formed emulsion layer (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n3.6\nContact angle measurement\n\nFig. 9\na reveals that the contact angle increases by increasing aging time with sludge solution. The slope of the contact angle growth is higher in the first 30\u00a0min of aging time. The increase in the concentration of sludge in media from 1\u00a0wt% to 2\u00a0wt% leads to an increase in contact angle for each aged time and rock type. That indicates more sludge structures are adsorbed on the rock surface. Changing contact angle from water wet surface toward an oil wet one is noticeably displayed in Fig. 9c through 9e. The highest contact angle was observed for vuggy carbonate samples. The existence of large pore space in this rock type encourages the sludge phase to settle in and alter the wettability. This phenomenon is obvious in the higher concentration of sludge (Table 4\n.).\nIn Fig. 9b the effect of commercial surfactant WA120 and the bio-surfactant ZSCE on the contact angle of rock samples were shown and compared with the measurements without using surfactant and their initial condition. After 1\u00a0h of aging, both surfactants could stop the wettability alteration from being more oil-wet. In this case, the bio-surfactant ZSCE was more efficient, especially for vuggy carbonate rock. But after 2\u00a0h of aging, the commercial surfactant WA120 was unable to keep rock surface wettability oil-wet and failed. On the other hand, after the same course of treatment, no significant contact angle changes were occurred by using bio-surfactant ZSCE.\nAs it was mentioned earlier, ZSCE molecules (i.e., saponins) consist of two parts: hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. When acid solution containing dispersed ZSCE is mixed with crude oil, ZSCE molecules are adsorbed to most polar and surface-active sub-fraction of oil component, asphaltene, and do not allow acid to react with it. Even in the case of wettability alteration, ZSCE molecules are competing by their hydrophilic part with sludge structure for adsorption on the rock surface. Eventually, the hydrophilic part is adsorbed onto the rock surface part while the hydrophobic part is oriented towards the aqueous phase.\n\n\n3.7\nIFT measurement\nOne of the key mechanisms in post-flush in matrix acidizing is to reduce interfacial between aqueous phase and oleic phase tension by utilizing proper surfactant. As IFT is reduced, the capillary number is increased, leading to reduced residual organic phase saturation. Thus, the ability of surfactant to lower the IFT between the aqueous solution and oil phase is one of the most important aspects during post-flush stage of stimulation process. IFTs for common chemical surfactants in oil and gas industry and ZSCE bio surfactant in the presence of oil phase are shown in Fig. 10\n. Results display that there is not much difference in the interfacial tension reduction caused by bio-surfactant compared to other commercial surfactant. Therefore, due to the low price and availability of proposed bio-surfactant, its application is cost effective and hence recommended. In Fig. 10, the CMCIFT of ZSCE bio-surfactant is 490\u00a0ppm, approximately 3.2\u00a0wt%, which is similar to CMC determined by conductivity technique.\n\n\n\n4\nMolecular dynamic (MD) simulation\nDesigning and optimization processes of the materials which are considered in the simulation side of the present paper were performed using Material Studio 2017 (BOIVIA) software. Two different asphaltene structures available in Iranian oil reservoirs, Saponin, toluene, and calcite surface occupied the designed simulation cell spaces so that enables 6 defined scenarios to be evaluated in a meaningful approach. Fig. 11\n illustrates the optimized structures of the above mentioned materials in terms of bonding energy and length, position of atoms in an individual structure, the bond angles (Takanohashi et al., 2004; Sheremata et al., 2004).\nThese two asphaltene structures have been selected in such a way that they are different in their functional groups (i.e. benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenylnapthalene, pyrene, diphenylnaphthalene, indole, dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran and porphyrin). Also, each of them represents different size of asphaltene molecular structure. Asphltene type I has oxygen and nitrogen in its structure and asphaltene type II contains sulfur, nitrogen and vanadium as heavy metal elements.\nThe following simulations were relaxed by the canonical NVT ensemble (at a constant amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T)). The simulation temperature was adjusted to 298.15\u00a0K. Six different scenarios were designed to simulate the possibility of formation and prevention of sludge taking the role of asphaltene into account. Atomic based summation method using Particle Mesh Ewald for the reciprocal part was used to correct Long-range electrostatic interactions. All designed cases were run in a vacuum environment of 90\u00a0\u00c5 applying COMPASS force field (Sun et al., 1998). COMPASS force field is developed by combining ab initio and empirical parameterization techniques for atomistic simulations of common organic molecules, inorganic small molecules, and polymers (Sun et al., 1998; Sun, 1998). Particle motion is integrated using the leapfrog method with a time step of 1 fs. Accordingly, simulations lasted 500 ps to calculate the properties. Total energy in the used COMPASS force field accounts for the following energies:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nE\n\nt\no\nt\na\n\n\nl\n=\n\nE\n\nb\no\nn\nd\n\n\n+\n\nE\n\na\nn\ng\nl\ne\n\n\n+\n\nE\n\no\no\np\n\n\n+\n\nE\n\nt\no\nr\ns\ni\no\nn\n\n\n+\n\nE\n\nc\nr\no\ns\ns\n\n\n+\n\nE\n\ne\nl\ne\nc\n\n\n+\n\nE\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Ebond, Eangle, Eoop, Etorsion, Ecross, Eelec and El represent bond stretching energy, angle bending energy, out-of-plane angle coordinates, bond torsion energy and cross-term interacting energy, respectively (Liu et al., 2015). Initially, NPT ensemble was applied to mix the materials with 500,000 steps with pressure and temperature of 1\u00a0bar and 298 k, respectively, and then NVT ensemble was run to place the materials on the calcite slab. Cut-off distance of 12.5\u00a0\u00c5 and accuracy of 0.001\u00a0kcal\/mol were used to be considered for long-range electrostatic interactions allowance for all boxes, van der Waals interaction and Ewald summation method, individually. Radial distribution function (RDF), g(r), shows the probability of the occurrence of a particle \u201ca\u201d at a specific distance of \u201cr\u201d from particle \u201cb\u201d compared to the average number density. The following Eq. 4 is used to calculate g(r) of the system.\n\n(3)\n\n\ng\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\u03c1\n4\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u03b4\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nt\n=\n1\n\nT\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\n\u0394\nN\n\n(\n\nr\n\u2192\nr\n+\n\u03b4\nr\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nN\nT\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n\n\u03c1\n\n, N, T, \n\n\u03b4\nr\n\n, \n\n\u0394\nN\n\n, represent system density, number pf atoms, simulation total time initial interval distance and number of atoms between r and r\u00a0+\u00a0\n\n\u03b4\nr\n\n, respectively. Moreover, it is considered that the peak of each plot represents specific neighbor molecules which could well imitate the microscale configuration of aggregation or\/and adsorption (Sheremata et al., 2004).\nIn the present study, two MD simulation scenarios were designed i) Two asphaltene structures (type I and II) were examined to determine the asphaltene type that has more possibility to precipitate after being mixed with HCl (cf. SM, S2, Table S2), ii) use the selected asphaltene molecules in presence of calcite rock surface and check the effect of Saponin molecules in induced sludge prevention (cf. SM, S2, Table S2).\n\n4.1\nScenario 1\n\n4.1.1\nAsphaltene (type I) and hydrochloric acid\nIn the simulation cell including Asphaltene (I), HCl and toluene as the asphaltene solvent, after passing 500 ps the system reached the stable condition so that the thermodynamic parameters such as temperature, energy, and the density of the simulation boxes converged, balanced and stable condition achieved after 30 ps after stabilization stage (cf. SM, Fig. S6). The appeared RDF plot picks indicate two values of 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 and around 4.5\u00a0\u00c5 as the obtained picks for NAsphaltene \u2013 HHCl and OAsphaltene \u2013 HHCl, respectively, implying the strong tendencies between Asphaltene (I) molecules and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 12\na and b).\n\n\n4.1.2\nAsphaltene (type II) and hydrochloric acid\nIn this step, Asphaltene (II) was exposed to HCl to check the affinity between the two structures. RDF results for NAsphaltene \u2013 HHCl and OAsphaltene \u2013 HHCl show the pick approximately equal values of 2\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.2\u00a0\u00c5, respectively (Fig. 12c and d). In comparison with the results for Asphaltene (I) (Fig. 12a and b), these simulated RDFs revealed the higher tendencies of Nitrogen and Oxygen existed in Asphaltene (II) to form a hydrogen bond through the available hydrogen cations in the simulation cell and in turn, more probability of sludge formation. Hence, Asphaltene (II) was selected to conduct scenario 2.\n\n\n\n4.2\nScenario 2\nIn this scenario, we tried to investigate the tendency of Asphaltene (II) and Saponin molecules to the calcite surface in conditions where i) each one (either Asphaltene (II) or Saponin molecules) is present on the rock surface and ii) both of them are in exposure to the rock surface. Toluene molecules were also present as the solvent of Asphaltene (II) molecules (cf. SI, S2, Table S2). The distances of CAsphaltene (II) \u2013 CaCalcite and CSaponin \u2013 CaCalcite are approximately simulated equally (r\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00c5). Nevertheless, as Fig. 13\na and b depict, the g(r) value for CSaponin \u2013 CaCalcite is significantly over than that for CAsphaltene (II) \u2013 CaCalcite. Despite the equal distance of the picks in both cases (r\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00c5), this comparison highlights the more tendency of calcite structure to attract Saponin towards the surface which also represents a potential role of Saponin to decrease the wettability alteration of calcite slab by alleviating the Asphaltene deposition process.\nAdding all the structures (i.e. Asphaltene (II), Saponin, and Toluene molecules on the calcite slab) to the simulation cell, yielded the shown RDF profiles for CAsphaltene (II) \u2013 CaCalcite and CAsphaltene(II) \u2013 CSaponin in Fig. 13c and d, respectively. While there is RDF pick at 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 in Fig. 13a, CAsphaltene (II) \u2013 CaCalcite formed a straight line with no pick (Fig. 13c) to highlight the role of Saponin presence in the simulation cell. On one hand, the tendency between CAsphaltene(II)\u2013 CSaponin has weakened the interaction between CAsphaltene (II) \u2013 CaCalcite, and on the other hand, the deviation of the asphaltene molecules affinity towards the Saponin molecules amplify the condition of less asphaltene deposition on the calcite surface and in turn, less wettability alteration towards water wetness. Comparison with the experimental findings, all these simulations results are in line with the results from the performed experiments in this study.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn the present study, the effects of sludge formation damage on the pay zone and its production were investigated. Since no substantial sludge is observed after mixing HCl acid with an asphaltene free crude oil, it is found to be a crucial component that forms induced sludge as a result of its interaction with injected acid during the field operations.\nThe amount of sludge increases significantly with an increase in the concentration of acid. Changing the wettability state towards oil-wetness after sludge deposition for all three types of used rocks in this paper represented the wettability state variation in oil reservoirs as another source of damage causing by sludge formation. In order to retain rock wettability to original water-wet state and to prevent formation of acid-induced sludge, two commercial surfactant and anti-sludge agent and the bio surfactant were examined. The commercial surfactant and bio-surfactant were able to maintain the rock water-wetness, however, in contrast to ZSCE bio-surfactant, the commercial one failed to maintain wettability state for a long aging time. Accordingly, the ZSCE bio-surfactant showed a better performance than the commercial ones to prevent the sludge formation. The results of molecular dynamic simulations show that hydrogen bond is the main force that actively leads to asphaltene deposition on the rock surface. Adding Saponin molecule to the simulation cells intervene in the interaction between calcite slap and Asphatene molecule as its affinity towards the calcite structure is higher than that of asphaltene molecule and introduces the used bio-surfactant in this study as an effective sludge formation inhibitor in reservoirs.\n\n\nAuthorship contributions\nConception and design of study: Bahram Soltani Soulgani, Hamidreza Asaadian, Pouyan Ahmadi, Babak Mokhtari; Acquisition of data: Mohammad Zare Khormizi, Hamidreza Asaadian, Pouyan Ahmadi, Saba Mohammadi; Analysis and\/or interpretation of data: Hamidreza Asaadian, Shirin Baghersaei, Pouyan Ahmadi.

The study area is located in Ny Friesland, Spitsbergen (Fig. 1b). Ny Friesland is bounded to the west by north\u2013south striking Wijdefjorden and the Hinlopenstretet in the east (Fig. 1b). A Cambrian-Ordovician carbonaceous succession is exposed along the south coast of the Hinlopen Strait\/Hinlopenstretet (Fig. 1b). The Cambro-Ordovician succession in Ny Friesland, is a part of the North Atlantic\/Arctic warm water carbonate platform on the eastern Laurentia margin (McKerrow et al., 1991; Stouge et al., 2012). The Ny Friesland Cambrian-Ordovician succession, which is about one km thick, includes a siliciclastic shoreline facies at the base, passing up to a shallow marine warm water carbonate platform (Fig. 1c).\nLower Paleozoic carbonate platforms with working petroleum systems are known from several places on the northern hemisphere; e.g., in Arctic areas such as North Greenland (Christiansen and Bojesen-Koefoed, 2021; Christiansen et al., 1989), the Timan-Pechora Province, Russia (Klimenko et al., 2011), western Newfoundland, Canada (Fowler and Douglas, 1984; Schwangler et al., 2020) and in NW Scotland (Parnell et al., 2018). Petroleum also occurs in Lower Paleozoic rocks from southern Scandinavia and the Baltic countries (Pedersen et al., 2007). The first attempt to drill for petroleum on Svalbard was carried out in 1920, and from 1963 until present-day, 18 test wells have been drilled without finding any areas of commercial interest (Senger et al., 2019), despite some shallow gas in Adventdalen (Ohm et al., 2019; Olaussen et al., 2019) and occurrences of both Carboniferous and Paleogene coals (Marshall et al., 2015; Nicolaisen et al., 2019; Senger et al., 2019; Van Koeverden et al., 2010). All wells were drilled in the southern and middle part of the Svalbard archipelago. Recent field work has revealed that the Cambro-Ordovician rocks in the north-eastern part of Spitsbergen are bituminous, and carbonate rocks are often stained with bitumen (Fig. 2\n), as are age equivalent rocks in North Greenland (Christiansen and Bojesen-Koefoed, 2021; Christiansen et al., 1989). In fact, the presence of bitumen in the Ny Friesland area has been known for a long time. First reported by Gobbett and Wilson (1960), who referred to it as \u201corganic material\u201d based on thin section studies of the dolomitic part of the sequence. Later Vallance and Fortey (1968) reported \u201cstinkstone\u201d from the Valhallfonna Formation, emitting a strong odor of hydrogen sulphide when fractured. Similarly, Fortey and Bruton (1973) reported unusually high organic content, while Harland (1997) mentioned that fresh surfaces of limestones from the Olenidsletta Member of the Valhallfonna Formation often emitted a strongly sulfurous smell (\u201cstinkstone\u201d). Kosteva and Teben'kov (2006) described the hydrocarbon content as a strong smell of kerosene, while Kr\u00f6ger et al. (2017) stated that parts of the succession were bituminous. Despite these field observations, the bitumen in Ny Friesland has received limited attention.\n\nLee et al. (2019) used lipid biomarkers and stable isotope data to characterize and investigate the relationship between microbial communities and nutrient cycle of the Early\u2013Middle Ordovician succession in Ny Friesland.\nIn this paper, we present results of total organic carbon (TOC), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, stable carbon isotope, thin layer chromatography\u2013flame ionization detection (TLC-FID) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) to assess the source rock potential of the carbonaceous rock samples from the Cambrian-Ordovician strata in Ny Friesland, NE Spitsbergen (Fig. 1). The study also investigates the variation in type and distribution of source rock properties and organic facies between and within the Cambrian and Ordovician samples. This could shed light on whether source rock organic facies, rather than maturity, are responsible for differences in petroleum generation potential.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and stratigraphy\nSvalbard, northeastern Greenland and eastern North Greenland were part of a huge Cambrian to Ordovician carbonate platform on the margin of the Laurentian tectonic plate (Stouge et al., 2012). The Laurentian tectonic plate formed with the opening of the Iapetus Ocean between ca. 610 and 520\u00a0Ma (Hinchey et al., 2015). In Svalbard, Lower Paleozoic rocks are well exposed in several areas but with different states of preservation due to Caledonian Orogeny and the post-Caledonian burial history (Harland, 1997; Worsley, 2008).\nPre-Caledonian and Lower Paleozoic rocks of Svalbard have collectively been referred to as Hecla Hoek; see summary by Dallmann et al. (1999). These rocks are metamorphosed and structurally complex along the west coast of Spitsbergen, but on eastern Spitsbergen and the adjacent islands of Nordaustlandet, virtually unmetamorphosed Late Precambrian and Early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks have been preserved (e.g. Wilson, 1961). Acritarchs near the base of the 7500\u00a0m thick Precambrian sequence suggest a late Riphean age (Knoll, 1982; Knoll and Swett, 1987). These sediments show an exceptional preservation giving an unusual complete view of the late Proterozoic biota including stromatolites (Butterfield et al., 1994; Fairchild, 1991; Knoll and Swett, 1990; Swett and Knoll, 1985).\n\nSmith and Rasmussen (2008) have reconstructed the Lower Paleozoic subsidence for the Ny Friesland area. The subsidence was modest during Cambrian, but increased markedly in the Lower Ordovician.\nThe thickness of the post Ordovician succession in the Ny Friesland area is uncertain. However, the Ny Friesland succession cannot have undergone deep burial because Conodont Alteration Index (CAI) values of 1 suggest a maximum paleotemperature of 90\u00a0\u00b0C (Bergstr\u00f6m, 1980). This implies an overburden of about 3\u00a0km if we assume a temperature gradient of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km. Oxygen isotope studies of trilobites from the Valhallfonna Formation has been tried as a proxy for the original water temperature, but this technique showed that the skeletal material was recrystallized yielding only crystallization temperature above 50\u00a0\u00b0C, in line with diagenetic alteration during enhanced burial temperature (Bennett et al., 2018).\nOur study area on Ny Friesland belongs to the eastern tectonostratigraphic terrane of the Caledonian rocks of Svalbard (Gee and Teben'kov, 2004; Harland, 1997). Structurally the studied outcrop; Basissletta (Fig. 1d) on the east coast of the northern part of the peninsula is situated on the eastern limb of the north-south striking elongated Atomfjella antiform (Witt-Nilsson et al., 1998). The studied succession underwent minor folding during the late Caledonian stage with a NNW\u2013SSE strike directions (Harland, 1997).\n\n2.1\nThe profilbekken outcrop\nThe boundary between the Upper Polarisbreen Shale (Upper Precambrian) and the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation (Fig. 1c) is not exposed, but in nearby areas it is described as a sharp contact with an unconformity corresponding to the uppermost Ediacaran and perhaps lowermost Cambrian (Knoll and Swett, 1987; Stouge et al., 2012). We here briefly describe the outcropping succession along the Profilbekken, for detailed description and interpretations in palaeontology, facies and ages see: Fortey and Bruton (1973), Stouge et al. (2012), Lehnert et al. (2013), Kr\u00f6ger et al. (2017) and references therein.\nAt Profilbekken (Fig. 1c and d) the succession begins with a cross bedded burrowed fine to medium grained sandstone of the Bl\u00e5revbreen Member followed by glauconitic sandy mudstone of the Topiggane Member, both assigned to the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation (Fig. 1c) (Fortey and Bruton, 1973; Stouge et al., 2012). These siliciclastic deposits represent shoreline to offshore condensed deposits, respectively and are onlapping the Precambrian craton. The base of the succeeding Cambrian shallow marine carbonates with stromatolites of the Ditlovtoppen Member of the Tokammane Formation (Fig. 1c) (Fortey and Bruton, 1973; Swett and Knoll, 1985) defines the shut off of the siliciclastic supply and the beginning of a thick (ca. 900m) succession of typical carbonate ramp deposits from inner to outer ramp facies (e.g. Schlager, 2003). The Lower Ordovician Kirtonryggen Formation (Fig. 1c) represents tidal flat to shallow-subtidal carbonate deposits under a tropical climate (Stouge et al., 2012). The unit can be interpreted as typical inner ramp deposits as described by Burchette and Wright (1992). The outcropping succession is ended by the upper Lower-Middle Ordovician Valhallfonna Formation (Fig. 1c). The basal unit of the Valhallfonna Formation, the Olenidsletta Member consists of dark grey to black bituminous limestone interbedded with calcareous mudstone and common cephalopod coquina (Fortey and Cocks, 2003; Kr\u00f6ger et al., 2017; Lehnert et al., 2013; Stouge et al., 2012) and was deposited during an increasing sea level (Kr\u00f6ger et al., 2017). The upper highly burrowed massive limestone of the dark grey-colored Profilbekken Member (Middle Ordovician) caps the exposed succession along the Profilbekken. Common phosphatic nodules, a few glauconitic thin beds and intensely bioturbated sediments suggest a condensed unit deposited below storm wave base. The unusual abundance of radiolarians (Maletz and Bruton, 2008), which might record plankton blooms in inner shelf or offshore areas suggest that the Valhallfonna Formation represent an outer ramp deposit.\n\n\n\n3\nSamples and geochemical analyses\n\n3.1\nSamples\nA total of 17 carbonate samples representing the Cambrian-Ordovician succession along SW-NE trend stream-cutting exposure at Profilbekken, Ny Friesland, Spitsbergen (Fig. 1b and d) were taken. These outcrop samples include: Five samples from the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation and one sample from the Lower Ordovician Kirtonryggen Formation. These samples are fossiliferous, and had bitumen staining or paraffinic smell when crushed and some contained microbial laminated mudstone with dark organic laminae (Fig. 2). In addition, 11 samples were collected from dark grey to black organic-rich calcareous shale or argillaceous limestone from the Lower to Middle Ordovician Valhallfonna Formation (Fig. 1c; Fig. 2). The outer surface was removed prior to sampling to avoid weathering and oxidation. The samples were stored in plastic bags, labelled and transported into the laboratory. The samples were cleaned with water, dried overnight at room temperature prior to crushing for geochemical analysis. The samples were collected by the University Centre in Svalbard in 2015 and have been stored under dark, ambient and dry conditions at the Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo.\n\n\n3.2\nGeochemical analyses\n\n3.2.1\nTotal organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nFor TOC and Rock-Eval pyrolysis, whole-rock samples were crushed into powder using a sling mill. For TOC determination, a Leco SC-632 instrument was used. Diluted HCl was added to the crushed-rock samples to remove carbonate, followed by repeated washing with distilled water, before drying. The samples were then introduced into the Leco combustion oven, and the amount of carbon in the sample was measured as carbon dioxide by an IR-detector. Inorganic carbon content was calculated based on sample weight differences before and after acid treatment. For Rock-Eval analyses, a HAWK instrument was used. Rock-Eval parameters such as S1 (free hydrocarbons released at 300\u00a0\u00b0C), S2 (petroleum products released due to pyrolysis of kerogen), S3 (CO2 produced by pyrolysis), T\nmax\n (temperature recorded at the apex of the S2 peak) and ratios such as oxygen index (OI = S3\/TOC x 100), hydrogen index (HI = S2\/TOC x 100) and production index (PI = S1\/S1\u00a0+\u00a0S2) were used to determine the source rock potential, and the degree of migrated hydrocarbon impregnation of the Ny Friesland samples. A standard sample, Jet-Rock 1, was run and values obtained were within the acceptable range given in NIGOGA (Weiss et al., 2000). The identification of mineral fractions from whole-rock polished thin section was performed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique of backscattered electron imagery.\n\n\n3.2.2\nExtraction of bitumen\nFor extraction of bitumen from the crushed rock samples, a SOXTEC\u2122 apparatus was used. A mixture of 93% dichloromethane (DCM) and 7% methanol (MeOH) was used for extraction. Samples were boiled for 1\u00a0h and subsequently rinsed for 2\u00a0h (Weiss et al., 2000). Activated copper beads were added to the solvent as a boiling aid and to remove elemental sulphur. The extractable organic matter (EOM) was then analysed for bulk petroleum composition and stable carbon isotope (\u03b413C) values.\n\n\n3.2.3\nThin layer chromatography\u2013flame ionization detection (TLC-FID)\nThe bulk composition of the extracted organic matter was determined by the area percentage of the compound classes, determined by thin layer chromatography\u2013flame ionization detection (TLC-FID) using a Iatroscan TH-10 MK-5 (Karlsen and Larter, 1991), equipped with Chromarod III silica-coated rods and linked with a computing integrator. 3\u00a0\u03bcl of the bulk extract was spotted at one end of the rods. The rods (10\u00a0at a time) were developed in solvents of different polarity; normal hexane for 36\u00a0min, enabling the saturated hydrocarbon fractions to move to the uppermost part of rods. After air drying for 2\u00a0min, the rods were developed in toluene for 8\u00a0min, causing the aromatic fraction to rise to about 50% of the length of the rods. The polar compounds (resins and asphaltenes) remain stationary at the point of sample application because these compounds are immobile in the solvents used for development. The rods were consequently dried at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1.5\u00a0min. Finally, the rods were put on the Iatroscan instrument at a scanning speed of 30\u00a0s\/scan. Pure grade hydrogen (180\u00a0ml\/min) and air (2.1\u00a0l\/min) were used for the detector.\n\n\n3.2.4\nStable carbon isotope analyses (\u03b413C)\nStable carbon isotopic ratios (\u03b413C) were measured for the bulk extract using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Elemental Analyser by Applied Petroleum Technology (Oslo, Norway). The samples were dissolved in a known amount of dichloromethane and 5\u00a0\u03bcl was transferred to a 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08mm tin capsule. The solvent was evaporated in an oven at 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Then samples were loaded into an automatic sampler and were dropped into combustion reactor (Thermo Fisher Scientific Elemental Analyzer), held at a combustion temperature of 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. The excess supply of oxygen helps to flush the tin capsules which results in a temperature rise to 1700\u00a0\u00b0C. The produced water was trapped on magnesium perchlorate. The carbon dioxide was separated on a column interfaced to a Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. A North Sea standard oil sample, NSO-1, was analysed as a reference. \u03b413C values are reported relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nTOC and Rock-Eval pyrolysis data\nSource rock screening data are presented in Table 1\n and are shown versus stratigraphic units in Fig. 3\n. Five samples (SO-02\/15, SO-03\/15, WP-21, WP-22 and WP-23) belong to the Lower Cambrian Tokammane Fm., 11 samples (SO-01\/15, SO-04\/15, SO-05\/15, SO-06\/15, SO-07\/15, SO-08\/15, SO-09\/15, SO-10\/15, WP-26, WP-27, WP-28) belong to the Lower to Middle Ordovician Valhallfonna Fm., and sample WP-25 is from the Lower Ordovician Kirtonryggen Fm. The TOC and Rock-Eval data reflect great differences between the investigated formations, see Fig. 3. Richness is higher in the Ordovician compared to that in the Cambrian samples.\nThe TOC and remaining hydrocarbon potential (S2) values for the Tokammane Fm. samples are extremely low, ranging from 0.05 to 0.16\u00a0wt% and 0.04\u20130.08\u00a0mg HC\/g rock, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3). HI values for the Tokammane Fm. samples range from 30 to 73\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Pyrolysis data from samples with very low TOC (<0.4\u00a0wt%) values, should according to Hunt (1996), be ignored. All the Cambrian samples have S2 values lower than 0.2\u00a0mg HC\/g rock (Peters, 1986) and thus confirm that most of the Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, including PI and Tmax are not significant (Peters, 1986). In North Greenland, Lower Cambrian shelf carbonates of the Portfjeld Formation are similarly marked by very low TOC contents, suggesting no source potential (Christiansen et al., 1989). Thus, despite being presented on the cross plots, discussion on the Rock-Eval data of the Cambrian succession will be very limited in the subsequent sections.\nIn the investigated Lower to Middle Ordovician Kirtonryggen and Valhallfonna Fm. samples, TOC and S2 values range from 0.25 to 2.09\u00a0wt% (average 0.74\u00a0wt%) and from 0.41 to 5.85\u00a0mg HC\/g rock (average 1.73\u00a0mg HC\/g rock), respectively. HI values for the Kirtonryggen and Valhallfonna Fm. samples range from 123 to 424\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC (average 209\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC). T\nmax\n for the Kirtonryggen and Valhallfonna Fm. samples range from 438 to 446\u00a0\u00b0C, except for sample SO-04\/15 in which case the T\nmax\n is 458\u00a0\u00b0C, while production indices (PI) range from 0.03 to 0.13 (average 0.08).\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n\nTLC\u2013FID and \u03b413C data\nTLC-FID and stable carbon isotope analyses were performed on eight Lower to Middle Ordovician Valhallfonna Fm. samples (SO-01\/15, SO-04\/15, SO-05\/15, SO-06\/15, SO-07\/15, SO-08\/15, SO-09\/15 and SO-10\/15) and two Lower Cambrian Tokammane Fm. samples (SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15) (Fig. 1c, Table 2\n\n). Total extractable organic matter (EOM) was generally low and uniform (0.25\u20130.53\u00a0mg\/g rock) in the Ordovician samples, except in sample SO-01\/15, where the EOM yield was higher (i.e. 2.17\u00a0mg\/g rock).\nThe extracts from the Valhallfonna Fm. samples consist of 12.23\u201332.76% saturated hydrocarbons, 4.71\u201341.25% aromatic hydrocarbons and 46.52\u201374.78% polar compounds, i.e. asphaltenes and resins (Table 2). The TLC-FID data also reveal that polar compounds are the dominant fraction in the extracts of the Valhallfonna Fm. samples, with polar\/hydrocarbon ratio >1 (range 1.26\u20132.97, Table 2), except for sample SO-01\/15, which contains more hydrocarbon compounds than polar fraction. Saturated hydrocarbons dominate over the aromatic hydrocarbons, thus saturated to aromatic hydrocarbon ratios (Sat\/Aro) are greater than unity (range 1.05\u20134.81) for the Valhallfonna Fm. samples, except for SO-01\/15 and SO-07\/15, in which case the values are 0.30 and 0.67, respectively (Table 2). The Sat\/Aro ratios for the two Tokammane Fm. samples are 22.20 and 63.01.\nThe EOM yields for the SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15 samples of the Tokammane Fm. were 0.32 and 1.17\u00a0mg\/g rock, respectively (Table 2). The SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15 samples had very uniform bitumen composition with 32.76 and 33.46% saturated hydrocarbons, 0.52 and 1.51% aromatic hydrocarbons and 66.72 and 65.03% polar compounds, respectively. The Sat\/Aro ratios for the SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15 samples are 63.01 and 22.20, respectively. However, the values for the Tokammane Fm. samples are suspicious due to the very low content of TOC.\n\u03b413C values for the samples show intermediate values and range from \u221228.4 to \u221230.9\u2030 (Table 2). The maximum variation in \u03b413C for the investigated samples reaches 2.5\u2030 (Table 2). The Cambrian Tokammane Fm. samples (SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15) show heavier \u03b413C values (\u221228.40 and \u221228.80\u2030) than any of the eight Ordovician Valhallfonna Fm. samples, which show \u03b413C values from \u221229.70 to \u221230.90\u2030.\n\n\n4.3\nScanning electron microscope (SEM)\nSEM analysis was carried out on two Cambrian (SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15) and four Ordovician (SO-01\/15, SO-07\/15, SO-08\/15 and SO-10\/15) samples (Fig. 4\n). In the dolomitic SO-02\/15 sample, only traces of iron and rutile (TiO2) were identified (Fig. 4a). Sample SO-03\/15 is calcite with traces of dolomite and contains iron oxide and kaolinite (Fig. 4b and c). The Ordovician samples are dominated by calcite minerals with dolomite found in lesser amounts (Fig. 4d and e). Pyrite has been identified in all Ordovician samples investigated. Framboidal pyrite crystals are very common in the Ordovician samples (Fig. 4d\u2013h). Apatite is also very common in all Ordovician samples investigated and is here exemplified in Fig. 4d and e. Other minerals observed in all the Ordovician samples, despite less frequent, include quartz and kaolinite. Sphalerite was identified in sample SO-10\/15.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThermal maturity\nThermal maturity levels of the investigated organic matter in the Ny Friesland samples were determined directly from results of T\nmax\n and indirectly from interpretation of production index (PI) and HI (Figs. 5\u20137\n\n\n). For the Cambrian samples, the T\nmax\n values and other maturity parameters are considered unreliable due to low amounts of TOC and only trace amounts of residual hydrocarbons (S2 peak). For the Ordovician samples, low to moderate PI values suggest most bitumen in these samples to be in situ (Figs. 5 and 6a). T\nmax\n data for the Ordovician samples suggest early-to- mid mature, corresponding to 0.70\u20130.85% Ro (Peters and Cassa, 1994). The slight difference in T\nmax\n values vertically is within the uncertainty of measurements.\nLack of preservation of the post Ordovician succession in Ny Friesland makes it difficult to assess the effect of burial on the maturity. Bergstr\u00f6m (1980) reported a Conodont Alteration Index (CAI) of 1, which suggests a maximum paleotemperature of 90\u00a0\u00b0C for the Ny Friesland Lower Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Assuming a geothermal gradient of 30\u00a0C\u00b0\/km, this corresponds to burial depth of 3\u00a0km.\nDespite good consistency in maturity estimate from PI and T\nmax\n, there is still some discrepancy for the Ordovician samples (Fig. 5b). To elaborate on this, 75% of the Ordovician samples (9 out of 12) are immature based on PI (i.e. PI\u00a0<\u00a00.10), but they are in the oil window maturity as inferred from T\nmax\n (438\u2013449\u00a0\u00b0C), see Fig. 5b. The other 25% of the Ordovician samples (i.e. three samples including samples SO-08, SO-10 and WP-27) show relatively high PI values of 0.10\u20130.13, indicating marginally mature petroleum at best. However, these latter samples are also characterized by the lowest organic carbon content (0.25\u20130.39\u00a0wt% TOC), compared to the 0.43\u20132.10\u00a0wt% for the 75% Ordovician samples. Elevated PI could be due to minor migrated bitumen (Abay et al., 2017). This is in agreement with the bitumen stain, visible, for example, on the surface of the WP-27 sample (see Fig. 2e). This shows that more data is needed for definite maturity assessment and conclusion is tentative.\n\n\n5.2\nPetroleum generation potential and kerogen type\nIllustration of TOC vs. S2 (Fig. 6b) for the samples ranks the relative richness of source rocks (Peters, 1986). Peters (1986) used a minimum cut off values of 0.5\u00a0wt% TOC and 2.5\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC S2 for a potential source rock at the beginning of oil generative window (0.5\u20130.6% Ro).\nThe investigated Lower to Middle Ordovician samples fulfil the criteria of minimum TOC content for carbonate rocks and suggest fair to good source rock potential for petroleum generation (Table 3, Fig. 6b). More importantly, all investigated Lower to Middle Ordovician samples have S2 values greater than 0.2\u00a0mg HC\/g rock, confirming the validity of the data (Peters, 1986).\nHI values for the investigated Ordovician samples point to a mixture of Type II and Type III kerogen (mixed oil- and gas-prone) at present (Fig. 7). However, it is imperative to note that woody Type III OM obviously does not exist in source rocks of Cambrian-Ordovician ages. Thus, Type III kerogen may represent poor preservation of algal material.\nSample WP-26 with HI value of 424\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC, indicates the highest oil source potential in the dataset (Figs. 7\u20138\n). This may reflect rich hydrogen content per unit carbon from organic contributions such as algal or bacterial organic matter. The high HI value for sample WP-26 may also indicate intervals of highly anoxic conditions during deposition of the Olenidsletta Member of the Valhallfonna Formation, as also reported for the analogous formation elsewhere (Schwangler et al., 2020).\nFollowing sample WP-26, four samples (SO-06\/15, SO-07\/15, WP-28 and SO-01\/15) have the next higher HI values (206\u2013280\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC), while the range in HI in the remaining seven Ordovician samples is between 123 and 193\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC. Thus, the Ordovician samples form three groups based on the HI values (Fig. 8a). Interestingly, the S2\/S3 ratio, also known as the hydrocarbon type index (Peters and Cassa, 1994) is consistent with the HI trend (Fig. 8a). In the investigated Ordovician samples, except in sample WP-27, the S2\/S3 is greater than 5, a value suggesting that most of the organic carbon in the Ordovician samples is reactive and capable of oil generating (Peters, 1986). On the other hand, the WP-27 sample has a S2\/S3 value of 3.24 which is typical of gas generation (Fig. 8a).\nMaturity will reduce the HI values to look less oil-prone, as is the case in central Spitsbergen (Koevoets et al., 2016). Emplacement of Late Mesozoic sills and dykes which are common in Svalbard have been reported to have locally affected the maturation of source rocks (Abay et al., 2017; M\u00f8rk and Bjor\u00f8y, 1984; Senger et al., 2014). Such intrusions exist south of Buldrev\u00e5gen (Fortey and Bruton, 1973), which is to the southeast of Ny Friesland. However, the proximity of this intrusion to the studied rocks is not known and, the thermal effect is thus uncertain. Moreover, the investigated Ordovician samples have generally similar TOC content (Table 1), suggesting that the variations in HI is reflecting the kerogen type, which in turn reflects differences in organic facies.\nDespite moderate source rock potential and possible facies variation among the Ordovician samples, it appears that there is a relatively good linear relationship between TOC and HI (Fig. 8b). Such relationship may suggest an overall uniformity of marine-organic matter type with good preservation (Abay et al., 2018), suggesting that the organic carbon is more oil prone (Dahl et al., 2004). Still, it is true that some samples may have better convertibility of TOC to petroleum than others despite having a relative lower TOC content. For example, samples WP-26 and WP-28 have HI values of 424 and 222\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC, respectively, despite the fact that TOC in the later sample is about 1.5 times higher than in the former (Table 1, Fig. 8b). This suggests that a large proportion of the organic matter in sample WP-26 is composed of reactive carbon as compared to a non-generative inert portion (Abay et al., 2018; Dahl et al., 2004).\nIn the Ordovician samples, the petroleum generation potential must have been higher than suggested by present-day data (Figs. 6 and 7). Assuming immature rocks (T\nmax\n <430\u00a0\u00b0C), the kerogen in samples such as SO-01, SO-06, WP-28 and SO-07 can be traced back to a Type II\/III from their current Type III\/II (Fig. 7b). Part of the reason for low HI can also be oxidation in outcrops (Graham et al., 1990). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, pre-existing free hydrocarbon compounds in the kerogen, related to oil already generated (S1) is very low in the Ny Friesland samples. Such low values are expected in outcrop samples due to volatilization and oxidation, and the fact that the rocks are not presently in an active petroleum generation thermal state. This low values may also reflect uplift and loss of petroleum products.\n\n\n5.3\nBulk geochemical properties of bitumen\nIn this study, TLC-FID and \u03b413C data on extracts were available only for two Cambrian (SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15) and eight Ordovician (SO-01\/15, SO-04\/15, SO-5\/15, SO-06\/15, SO-07\/15, SO-08\/15, SO-09\/15 and SO-10\/15) samples (Table 2, Figs. 9\u201311\n\n\n).\n\n5.3.1\nTLC\u2013FID data\nLow bitumen yields of the investigated samples are indicative of in situ generated petroleum as opposed to migrated petroleum (cf. Karlsen et al., 2004), in agreement with Fig. 6a. However, the yields of the investigated samples are greater than the bitumen yield reported by Karlsen and Larter (1991) for in situ organic matter in carbonate cemented rocks. Thus, it may tentatively be argued that the Ny Friesland samples could also contain some migrated petroleum as well as in situ bitumen. Interestingly, the extractability of the samples from the Ny Friesland is similar to that of migrated hydrocarbons from Lower Cambrian samples in North Greenland (Christiansen et al., 1989; page 62). The relative proportion of petroleum fractions reveals that the aromatic and polar fractions reflect greater variation than the saturated fractions (Table 2, Fig. 9). Particularly, the content of saturated hydrocarbons is low in the Ny Friesland samples when compared with that of common crude oils (Tissot and Welte, 1978), as can be seen in Fig. 9, and with core extracts on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (Abay et al., 2014; Bhullar et al., 1999b; Karlsen et al., 1995; Karlsen and Skeie, 2006; Karlsen and Larter, 1991). This dissimilarity in bulk composition between common oils and the Ny Friesland extracts is supported by data for a North Sea oil (NSO-1), included as a standard, which is characterized by 50% saturates, 33% aromatics and 17% polar fractions (Fig. 9).\nExtract yields and low content of hydrocarbon fractions (i.e. saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons) and\/or higher polar contents like these could be related to microbial degradation of saturated HCs and other processes, such as water washing and evaporation\/weathering (Abay et al., 2014; Bhullar et al., 1999a; Karlsen et al., 1995; Karlsen and Larter, 1991) or to greater content of sulphur-aromatic compounds of kerogen deposited in marine carbonate rocks (Waples, 1985). Furthermore, a Sat\/Aro ratio of less than 5 for all Ordovician samples investigated is generally consistent with hydrocarbons sourced from carbonate source rocks and\/or biodegradation in reservoirs (Wang et al., 2015).\n\n\n5.3.2\n\u03b413C composition of extracts\nThe range of \u03b413C (Table 2) for the investigated Ny Friesland samples is similar to oils of Lower Paleozoic age (Zdanaviciute et al., 2012; Christiansen et al., 1989). Fig. 10 shows the \u03b413C values of the extracts plotted versus sample coordinates. Based on their \u03b413C values, the investigated Ny Friesland samples can be divided into three trends or groups (Figs. 10 and 11). The first includes the Cambrian samples (i.e. SO-02\/15 and SO-03\/15) with relatively heavy (more positive) \u03b413C ratios. The second and third groups consist of the Ordovician samples, which are characterized by lighter (more negative) \u03b413C values. Among the Ordovician samples, in general, more negative \u03b413C values were found for the SO-08\/15, SO-09\/15 and SO-10\/15 samples, located towards the north-eastern part of the study area (Fig. 10).Various factors might explain such differences. According to Peters et al. (1989), oils that are derived from the same type of organic facies and that are of similar maturity will generally differ only up to a maximum of 1\u20131.5\u2030 \u03b413C. Because the maturity range is limited in the investigated Ny Friesland samples (Fig. 5), it cannot have significant effect on the \u03b413C. Thus, \u03b413C variation of up to 2.5\u2030 for the investigated samples (Table 2) could be attributed to organic facies, consistent with the kerogen type differences already suggested (Fig. 8). The trend observed within the Ordovician samples (Fig. 11), further suggests that the difference in the carbon isotope values is real, and depicts the depositional condition of the sediment (Fig. 11).\nInterestingly, the variation in \u03b413C appears to follow the geographic sample location, where the isotopes become lighter from SW to NE (Figs. 10 and 11). Such regional variations in \u03b413C values from a heavier to a lighter \u03b413C value often reflects changes from a less marine or dysaerobic facies in the proximal part of the basin, to a more anoxic, marine facies in the distal part (Karlsen et al., 1995). Devonian oils and OM samples from the Norwegian Sea and the UK have \u03b413C values in the range of \u221232\u2030 (Karlsen et al., 1995), believed in part due to assimilation of isotopically light methane by bacteria. It is not well known why OM from carbonate platforms in the Paleozoic can be isotopically light, but assimilation of biogenic methane on carbonate platforms is certainly possible.\n\n\n\n5.4\nScanning electron microscope (SEM)\nThe presence of kaolinite in the Cambrian SO-03\/15 sample may suggest leaching of silicate minerals at shallow burial depth (Bj\u00f8rlykke, 2015). Such minerals are common in oxic depositional systems. The presence of abundant framboidal pyrite crystals in the Ordovician samples (Fig. 4d\u2013h) reflects a marine anoxic depositional system (Skei, 1988; Taylor and Macquaker, 2011), consistent with the HI and \u03b413C data. Framboidal pyrite occurs with apatite. Phosphatic horizons such as apatite from the investigated Ordovician succession in Ny Friesland have also been related to upwelling (Fortey, 1980). Framboidal pyrites is also suggestive of high sulphide supply from organic matter, as opposed to euhedral pyrite, which is linked with iron oxide minerals and detrital clay minerals (cf. Taylor and Macquaker, 2011). The presence of framboidal pyrite within the Ny Friesland Ordovician samples thus indicates that bacterial sulfate reduction prevailed during deposition and early diagenesis (Taylor and Macquaker, 2000). In contrast, occurrences of iron oxide and kaolinite and absence of framboidal pyrite in the Cambrian samples suggest that sulfate reduction did not occur, and this is in accordance with the low TOC content in these samples.\n\n\n5.5\nOrganic facies\nWe have above discussed differences in petroleum potential for the Ny Friesland samples. Because the maturity for the Ny Friesland samples is not very high (Figs. 5\u20137), these differences in petroleum potential could be attributed to the organic facies, including the organic matter input, and the preservation processes such as depositional environment and biological activities (cf. Jones, 1984).\n\nJones (1984), defined seven organic facies (A, AB, B, BC, C, CD and D) on the basis of HI for thermally immature or early mature samples. Such classification of organic facies is on the basis of organic constituent, without regard to the inorganic component. The HI of immature samples can be roughly estimated from the present-day HI and maturity data (Waples, 1979). Thus, in Fig. 7b, we can trace back (extrapolate) the samples along the maturation pathway to their approximate immature position (Ro <0.5%). Accordingly, for the Ordovician Ny Friesland samples, three types of organic facies are recognized: B, BC and C (Fig. 12\n).\nOnly sample WP-26 plots close to organic facies B, which is typified by TOC >1.5 and HI of >350 (Jones, 1984). However, using an extrapolated HI value of about 500\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC at a maturation of 0.5% Ro (Fig. 7b), sample WP-26 would plot inside organic facies B. Samples SO-06\/15, SO-07\/15, SO-01\/15, WP-28 and possibly also WP-25 (Fig. 12a and b) are plotted inside organic facies BC, characterized by HI of 200\u2013350 (Jones, 1984). In Fig. 12a and b, these samples are plotted very close to organic facies C and D. Taking into account their likely original HI values, these samples are clearly outside this category and thus are assigned to organic facies BC (shaded area in Fig. 12a and b). Samples SO-04\/15, SO-05, SO-10, SO-09, SO-08 and WP-27 belong to organic facies C, which according to Jones (1984), has HI values between 50 and 200\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC. Samples indicated as organic facies C, can be considered similar to those in organic facies BC in terms of their original HI values. But they are distinctly different, as also indicated in Figs. 6\u20138.\nThe difference between sample WP-26 (organic facies B) and those samples of organic facies BC and C points to variations in organic matter or differences in oxygenation and preservation. Hence, some samples such as sample WP-26 of the Valhallfonna Formation could have been deposited under relative anoxic condition. This may represent a part of the Olenidsletta Member of the Valhallfonna Formation (Fig. 1c), in which lamination is well known. Anoxic conditions for the Ordovician Valhallfonna Formation samples can also be inferred from the abundant occurrences of pyrite in samples such as SO-01\/15 (Fig. 4). In SO-10\/15, there is also sphalerite and apatite, often associated with upwelling. These conditions, in general, favoured preservation of organic matter of relatively good quality. This organic-rich source rock is probably related to a relative sea level increase during the deposition of the Olenidsletta Member of the Valhallfonna Formation, also described by Kr\u00f6ger et al. (2017) and Fortey and Bruton (1973) based on faunal and sedimentological evidences. On the other hand, poorer source rock quality (i.e. low in HI) for the rest of the samples may suggest deposition which grades to a more shallow water condition, thus promoting bioturbation and oxidation (cf. Jones, 1984; Pratt, 1982, Fig. 12 a and b). Even though bioturbation is rare in the Olenidsletta Member, the overlying Profilbekken Member comprises bioturbated limestone beds (Stouge et al., 2012).\nIn summary, comparing bulk geochemical composition (isotope and TLC-FID), TOC and Rock-Eval data, we identified at least three different organic facies types (B, BC and C) for the Ordovician succession in Ny Friesland. In the samples investigated, these differences reflect mainly variations in depositional environments and related biological processes as well as changes in marine\/phytoplanktonic input, resulting in alternating high and low source potential (Herbin et al., 1993). Thus, compositional differences in the Ny Friesland samples is chiefly due to source facies, rather than differences in thermal maturation.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nGeochemical data from carbonate rocks of Cambro-Ordovician succession outcropping in Ny Friesland, Svalbard suggest that:\n\n\u2022\nThe Lower Cambrian Tokammane Formation samples and the Lower to Middle Ordovician Kirtonryggen and Valhallfonna formation samples show great variation in TOC, Rock-Eval data and bulk geochemical data on extracts.\n\n\n\u2022\nBased on T\nmax\n, the maturities of the investigated samples range from early to peak oil window, corresponding to 0.70\u20130.85% Ro.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe Tokammane Formation samples are generally lean in organic matter, and constitute no source rocks for petroleum generation.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe Lower to Middle Ordovician samples of the Kirtonryggen and Valhallfonna formations have moderate TOC contents suggesting fair to good source rock richness. Their relatively high HI values are interesting with respect to OM quality. While most samples show moderate potential, HI values as high as 424\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC at T\nmax\n of 444\u00a0\u00b0C suggest very good source rock intervals for oil generation.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe differences in HI values of the Ordovician samples may reflect diversity of organic facies including biological processes in the sediments. But, more work is needed to understand this better. In particular, it is crucial to investigate more data for TOC contents, isotope signatures, organic petrography and biomarker analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit author statement\nAbay, Tesfamariam Berhane: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing \u2013 original draft preparation, Visualization, Investigation, Analysis.

The depth of these boreholes can be several kilometers below sea level and there may be many variations in the formation properties through various subsurface strata along the depth of the borehole. In addition to the naturally occurring formation fractures, the drilling process inherently induces cracks and fissures along the borehole wall and under normal conditions this does not pose any problems for the drilling operations. However when the stresses induced by drilling are too high, the fissures may open up and cause an unwanted influx\/efflux of formation\/drilling fluids between the formation and borehole\u00a0(Brudy and Zoback, 1999). Such conditions are one of the main causes for a phenomenon known as \u201ckick\u201d, that occur due to sudden loss of stability in the pressure of the fluid column in the borehole. In severe cases where these kick events cannot be controlled, a loss of the wellbore may occur, sometimes also accompanied with a loss of the drill-string due to collapse of the wellbore, resulting in severe economic liability for the operators. Thus the drilling operations are carefully monitored using various logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools and post drilling well logging techniques\u00a0(Ellis and Singer, 2007). However, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge there is no LWD technique currently in use to measure or monitor such influx\/efflux event.\nCommonly used early kick detection systems monitor various operational parameters from the drilling platform\u00a0(Nayeem et al., 2016). These systems amongst other tools usually also involve the monitoring of drilling fluid volume and pressure being circulated into the drill-string\u00a0(Orban et al., 1991). In the event of a kick that may occur several kilometers down the borehole, it takes several minutes before the effects of a kick are measurable in the operational parameters by these systems. Such information delay, in critical cases, may lead to blowouts.\nThere has been a consistent effort to develop LWD tools for monitoring fluid influx\/efflux in boreholes. Some of these techniques include physical measurement of the pressure of the drilling fluid near the drill bit\u00a0(Andrew, 1942; Grosso and Jr., 1988), use of radioisotopes for measuring changes in density of drilling fluid\u00a0(Murphy and Coope, 1985), measurement of dielectric constant of the drilling fluid\u00a0(Rodney, 1990) and acoustic techniques measuring the sound speed in drilling fluid\u00a0(Wu, 2008) or the amount of gas bubbles in the drilling fluid\u00a0(Taherian and Garcia-Osuna, 2016). Most of these tools however are either not very sensitive to small influx\/efflux or require additional instrumentation to be added to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) which is neither very practical nor economical in an already complex drilling system.\nThe use of ultrasonic measurements in LWD is common for imaging the borehole surface for fissures, borehole profile and assessment of rheological properties of the formation\u00a0(Ellis and Singer, 2007). Fig.\u00a01 is a schematic representation of a typical BHA with ultrasonic LWD tools. The drilling fluid is circulated from the surface, through the center of the drill-string, through the drill bit nozzles into the borehole, carrying the rock cuttings back to the surface through the annulus between the borehole and the BHA. The typical flow velocity of the drilling fluid along this axial component is around 2\u20137\u00a0m\/s\u00a0(Ferguson and Klotz, 1954). While drilling, the typical rotation speed of the BHA is about 1\u20133 revolutions-per-second (rps)\u00a0(Chevron et al., 2021). In the event of an influx\/efflux, the formation\/drilling fluid will flow along the radial direction as depicted in Fig.\u00a01. It is desirable that the same ultrasonic LWD tools can also be used for the detection and quantification of influx\/efflux in the boreholes while drilling as it would eliminate the need for major modifications or increased complexity in the BHA.\n\nConsiderable work has been done by various researchers to evaluate Doppler ultrasound for characterizing radial flow in boreholes. Pulsed wave (PW) and continuous wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound methods for estimating radial flow volumes and blockages during production logging are described by\u00a0Razi et al. (1995),\u00a0Ravenscroft et al. (1998) and\u00a0Nyhavn et al. (1999). Although radial flow quantification in production logging may seem similar to influx\/efflux while drilling, the speed of rotation of the tool and frequency of ultrasonic probes used in LWD make the direct application of production logging tools to LWD quite challenging. PW Doppler ultrasound has been studied further under laboratory conditions for post-drilling well logging by\u00a0Saito and Niitsuma (2001) and\u00a0Monnier and Guillermin (2003). These papers however have not investigated the applicability of the their methods under LWD conditions. Details of the Doppler ultrasound parameters used, signal processing methods and their influence on the radial flow estimates have also not been discussed in these papers.\nThis paper evaluates the performance of PW Doppler ultrasound for the quantification of radial flow velocity from small fissures in a borehole wall in a laboratory scale experimental setup mimicking LWD conditions. The influence of various factors of the LWD environment on PW Doppler measurements and the limiting conditions when applied to existing LWD tools for flow quantification are also discussed. A method for estimating the fissure geometry using the PW Doppler signal is also described and compared with conventional ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging used in LWD tools.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nThe major parameters influencing ultrasonic Doppler measurements in a LWD scenario can be narrowed down to: the geometrical constraints of the drill-string inside a borehole, properties of drilling fluid, ultrasonic transducers and associated acquisition parameters, and the motion of the drill-string. The effect of each of these parameters on PW Doppler measurements are discussed in this section.\nThe borehole environment typically operates under high pressure and temperature, the effect of these parameters on Doppler measurements have not been evaluated in this study.\n\n2.1\nExperimental setup\nThe experimental setup consists of a flow chamber as shown in Fig.\u00a02 which emulates the geometrical and influx flow conditions inside a typical borehole. For simplicity, water is used as the working fluid for all experiments described in this paper as the sound velocity in water is close to the sound velocities typically observed in typical water-based drilling fluids\u00a0(Motz et al., 1998). Water-based drilling fluids typically contain barite or bentonite as the major dispersed constituent. We dispersed cornflour in water (1g\/l) to mimic the dispersed particles in water-based drilling fluids as the typical particle size cornflour (\n\u2248\n60\n\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n) is similar to barite\/bentonite (\n\u2248\n40\u2013100\n\n\n\u03bc\nm\n\n;\u00a0Abdou and El-Sayed\u00a0Ahmed,\u00a02011). The dispersed particles in the fluid serve as Rayleigh scatterers of ultrasound which is crucial for Doppler processing. Further, the attenuation of ultrasound in water is very low compared to that is drilling fluids\u00a0(Motz et al., 1998). However, ultrasound pulse-echo is routinely employed in LWD which suggest that the amplitude of 2-way ultrasound propagation between the transducer and borehole wall is usually at acceptable levels. The effect of attenuation of drilling fluids on Doppler ultrasound is not known and is beyond the scope of this work. The authors plan to study this aspect in the future.\n\n\nThe water with dispersed cornflour is fed into the lower part of the flow chamber which acts as a buffer to stabilize the flow before it passes through the orifice plate into the upper part of the flow chamber. The orifice plate emulates fractures in the borehole wall. The surface on which the orifice place is mounted emulates the borehole wall. The orifice plate is 3D printed with orifices of different geometries as desired to mimic fissures in the borehole wall. Fig.\u00a03 shows two such orifice plates used for most of the experiments described in this paper. The water flows out of the orifice in the form of a jet towards the ultrasonic probe as depicted in Fig.\u00a02. The velocity of the water jet is controlled by adjusting the inlet flow into the flow chamber. This velocity is calculated using the flow rate equation \n\n(1)\n\n\nQ\n=\nA\nv\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \nQ\n is the flow rate through the inlet, \nA\n is the area of the orifice and \nv\n is the velocity at vena-contracta of the water jet.\nThe water pumped out from outlet at the top of the flow cell and is recirculated through in a closed loop. The inlet flow rate of water into the flow cell is measured using an inline ultrasonic flow meter and the flow rate is controlled by adjusting the head of the water feed tank. The feed tank is mounted on an electromagnetic stirrer to keep the dispersion of cornflour uniform throughout the experiment. Fig.\u00a04 shows the complete experimental setup. A Verasonics Vantage 256 system (Verasonics Inc. Redmond, WA, USA) connected with a custom cannon connector PCB interface is used as the ultrasonic pulser-receiver. The acquisition and Doppler signal processing script was written in MATLAB (2019b, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and is detailed in Section\u00a02.4.\nThe ultrasonic probe is mounted perpendicular to the water jet at a distance \nh\n from the orifice plate on a robotic scanner. The distance between the transducer and the orifice plate was varied between 25\u201350\u00a0mm in our experiments which is similar to the spacing between an ultrasonic probe and the borehole wall in typical LWD measurements\u00a0(Orban et al., 2021; Maeso et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nPW Doppler parameters\nThis work aims to explore an ultrasound Doppler method which can be directly applied to existing LWD tools used for imaging the borehole wall. Publications on LWD field measurements from leading drilling companies indicate the use of ultrasonic transducers in a frequency range of 100kHz\u20131MHz\u00a0(Shrivastava et al., 2019; Blyth et al., 2021; Maeso et al., 2018; Longo et al., 2012; Leonard, 2016). These publications also suggest the use of unfocused transducers, although focused transducers have also been reported in some papers. Further, the element size of the transducers, as reported in these publications, range between 1\/2 to 3\/4inches in diameter.\nConsidering these transducer specifications, PW Doppler is well suited as it can be applied with a single element transducer and enables the measurement of radial flow velocities at multiple points along the ultrasound beam. The influence of various factors of the LWD environment on Doppler ultrasound are detailed in this section.\n\n2.2.1\nPW Doppler - fundamentals\nThere is a wide variety of literature on the basic principles of PW Doppler ultrasound, for example by\u00a0Hoskins (2019), but a very brief overview of its fundamentals specific to the terms used in this paper are discussed here. Fig.\u00a05 outlines the basic principles involved in PW Doppler processing. A series of ultrasonic pulses are fired into the fluid where velocity estimates are desired and the pulse-echo signals (also called as RF signals) are recorded (Fig.\u00a05a). The time dimension in each pulse-echo signal is termed as the \u201cfast-time\u201d dimension which is analogous to the depth in convention pulse-echo ultrasound imaging. The firing rate or the frequency between each firing is called as the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Several such RF signals are recorded over the \u201cslow-time\u201d dimension with intervals equal to PRF to form a \u201cpacket\u201d of RF data. The number of RF signals in each packet is called as the \u201cobservation-window\u201d. The RF signals in each packet are then demodulated to obtain the in-phase quadrature (IQ) signal which contains both amplitude and phase information of the signal. The IQ signal is sampled at specific fast-time locations, producing a slow-time signal for each packet (Fig.\u00a05b). Ths slow-time signals are then transformed into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain the PW Doppler spectra (Fig.\u00a05c). This spectra contains information about the velocity components in the flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2\nVelocity measurement limit\nThe maximum flow velocity that can be unambiguously determined using PW Doppler is given by the Nyquist limit\u00a0(Hoskins, 2019) and can be expressed by \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\nn\ny\nq\n\n\n=\nc\n\n\nPRF\n\n\n4\nf\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \nc\n is the speed of ultrasound, PRF is the pulse repetition frequency and \nf\n is the frequency of ultrasound. The PRF is the frequency of firing successive ultrasonic pulses and is limited by the 2-way transit time of ultrasound in the drilling fluid so that successive pulses do not interfere with each other. Considering the maximum spacing between the transducer and borehole wall to be around 50\u00a0mm, the maximum PRF is theoretically limited to around 15kHz. This will be further reduced due to any eccentricity in the BHA while drilling. Thus, in practice a PRF which is much lower than this must be used.\nFurthermore, the presence of any stationary or slow-moving features within the ultrasound beam causes \u201cclutter\u201d in the PW Doppler spectra centered near 0 frequency (Fig.\u00a05). Recollect that the axial flow component of the drilling fluid in the borehole (Fig.\u00a01), which is perpendicular to the ultrasonic beam, has a typical velocity of around 2\u20137\u00a0m\/s. Since this component is moving orthogonal to the ultrasound beam, its pulse-echo response would be similar to a stationary or slow-moving target in the fast-time dimension and thus produce clutter in the PW spectra. However, the bandwidth of this clutter would be a function of its flow velocity in the axial direction\u00a0(Yu et al., 2006) and can be calculated as \n\n(3)\n\n\nB\n\n\nW\n\n\nc\nl\nu\nt\nt\ne\nr\n\n\n\u2248\n\n\n2\n\n\nv\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nv\n\n\na\n\n\n is the axial velocity of the drilling fluid and \nW\n is the width of the ultrasound beam.\nThe combined effect of these parameters defines the measurable velocity range for the influx\/efflux in the radial direction of the borehole. The region between the blue and red\/magenta curves in Fig.\u00a06 shows the measurable velocity range for typical LWD ultrasonic probe frequencies and element size of 1\/2inch (12.7\u00a0mm). Low frequency transducers have a high Nyquist limit but also have a high clutter bandwidth, as seen in Fig.\u00a06, and would not be sensitive to small influx\/efflux velocities. The possibility of detecting small influx\/efflux velocities is crucial from an early kick detection standpoint and thereby high frequency transducers would perform better. We have used a thus selected a 1MHz transducer for the experiments discussed in this paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3\nNearfield of ultrasonic transducer\nThe nearfield of a transducer is the region very close to the transducer where the sound pressure is highly oscillatory along the ultrasound beam and therefore, for most practical purposes, it is desirable to work beyond the nearfield. The frequency and element size of the transducer influence the length of its nearfield\u00a0(Krautkr\u00e4mer and Krautkr\u00e4mer, 1990) and this can be calculated for a transducer with a circular element using \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u03bb\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \nD\n is the element diameter of the ultrasonic transducer and \n\u03bb\n is the wavelength of ultrasound in the drilling fluid. It must be noted that the element diameter also influences the width of the ultrasound beam \nW\n in Eq.\u00a0(3).\n\nFig.\u00a07 charts out the length of nearfield for unfocused ultrasonic transducers with parameters discussed earlier. Considering that 1\/2inch (12.7\u00a0mm) and 3\/4inch (19.1\u00a0mm) transducers are most commonly used in LWD tools, we choose the smaller, 1\/2inch diameter transducer which has a nearfield of approx. 25\u00a0mm for the experiments discussed in this paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4\nPulse length\nVelocity estimation by PW Doppler relies primarily on the back-scattered ultrasound signal from microscopic scatterers in the fluid. Rayleigh scattering is the primary mode of this back-scattered ultrasound signal and by nature is a very weak signal. The use of long pulse lengths is thus essential to obtain an adequate power of the PW Doppler signal. The pulse length is the product of the wavelength of ultrasound and the number of cycles transmitted per pulse. It directly impacts the power of the Doppler signal and spatial resolution of velocity estimates. Further, the pulse length has an inverse relationship to the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse, which influences the bandwidth of the PW Doppler spectra and in turn the accuracy of velocity estimates. Additionally, the axial resolution and variance in velocity estimates depends on the size of the sample volume used for Doppler processing, which is usually equal to the pulse length. Considering these factors, it is desired to have long pulse lengths with 8\u201310\n\n\u03bb\n per pulse in typical PW Doppler acquisitions. In a typical LWD scenario, the distance between the ultrasonic transducer and the borehole wall is around 25\u201350\u00a0mm as discussed in Section\u00a02.1, which is equivalent to 16\u201332\n\n\u03bb\n for a 1MHz ultrasonic transducer. A PW Doppler acquisition using the conventional 8\u201310\n\n\u03bb\n pulse, would result in the space between the transducer and borehole wall to be the equivalent of just about 2\u20134 sample volumes, which will yield a very low spatial resolution of velocity estimates. This paper explores the use of short pulse lengths containing 2\u20134\n\n\u03bb\n per pulse for obtaining high spatial resolution of velocity estimates using PW Doppler in an LWD scenario.\n\n\n\n2.3\nMotion of drill-string\nThe motion of a typical BHA while drilling can be broken down into its axial, circumferential and radial components as depicted in Fig.\u00a08. The axial component is primarily the rate of penetration (ROP) and is typically around few m\/hr. From an ultrasonic measurement point of view, this velocity is very low and unlikely to have any impact on acquisition parameters. The circumferential velocity is primarily due to the rotation of the BHA and is typically around 1\u20134rps. Unlike conventional ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements, PW Doppler acquisitions usually require more than 50\u2013100 signals per location for obtaining reasonably low variance in velocity estimates. In practice the ultrasound transducer would acquire these signals while the tool is rotating. Thus its acquisition rate needs to match or exceed the speed of the tool relative to the desired spatial resolution of velocity estimates in the circumferential direction. This can be calculated by \n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\nPRF\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\nBHA\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere, \n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\nBHA\n\n\n is the angular velocity of the BHA in rad\/s, \nR\n is the radius of the borehole, \nN\n is the number of ultrasound signals required for Doppler processing and \n\n\u0394\nx\n\n is the spatial resolution of velocity estimate in circumferential direction.\n\nRadial motion of the BHA is not typically desirable, but is inevitable due to drill-string vibrations or while drilling along a deviated or horizontal direction. This causes the axis of the BHA to be eccentric relative to the borehole axis. There may also be additional vibrations of the BHA along the other directions and while there are not many published works characterizing these vibrations,\u00a0Bowler et al. (2016) indicate that these were usually low frequency vibrations of around 4Hz during their logging run. From an ultrasound Doppler standpoint, these vibrations would cause slight broadening of the PW spectra but this would not affect the estimation of mean velocity. A PRF of 4kHz was arbitrarily chosen, within the limits discussed earlier, for all experiments described in this paper.\n\n\n2.4\nSignal processing chain\nRF data acquired from the Verasonics Vantage 256 system (Verasonics Inc. Redmond, WA, USA) is first reshaped into a 2D matrix with the columns representing the slow-time dimension and rows representing the fast-time dimension. The time interval between acquisitions in two adjacent columns is equal to 1\/PRF. A observation-window of 200 was used for our experiments which was optimized as discussed in Section\u00a03.1.1. A clutter filter is then applied on each of the pulse-echo acquisitions to remove the stationary and slow-moving signals caused by the initial pulse, back-wall echo and any transverse motion in the fluid column. The clutter filter used is a Kaiser windowed FIR filter of order 50 for most of the results discussed in this paper except in Section\u00a03.1.3 which discusses the application of polynomial regression filter for reducing the observation-window. The RF signal is then demodulated to the base band to obtain the IQ signal. The PW Doppler spectra for each sample volume is then obtained by using a Hamming windowed FFT in the slow-time dimension with an 80% overlap and subsequently averaging over the fast-time dimension. The window length used for the FFT is approximately equal to the time it would take for a random scatterer in the water jet to travel a distance equal to 1 sample volume. This depends on the velocity of the water jet being evaluated. The peaks in the PW Doppler spectra are used to calculate the mean velocity of the fluid in each sample volume. Considering that we use short pulse lengths for our experiments, the PW spectra has a poor SNR and some form of dynamic threshold estimator is required for isolating the peaks in the PW spectra. An estimator utilizing the \u201csum of median and standard deviation\u201d for each PW spectra was found to be effective. Further, the turbulent nature of the water jet results in a large variance in radial flow velocities of the jet at any given point in the slow-time dimension. This causes a broadening of the PW spectra and induces a high variance in the position of the peak maxima between subsequent signals at the same position. This effect is illustrated in Fig.\u00a09 which shows the PW spectra from two subsequent packets (orange and blue) of the flow from a \n\u2205\n10\u00a0mm orifice with a velocity of 0.5m\/s. To make the peak selection unambiguous and minimize the variance in mean velocity estimates, the centroid of the PW spectra was found to be effective instead of choosing the peaks with the absolute maximum amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\n\n3.1\nVelocity estimation\nThe flow profile during an influx\/efflux scenario is inherently complicated and would have a broad distribution of flow velocities even at a particular spatial location. Although mean the velocity at each spatial location would yield significant information for kick detection; PW Doppler has the potential to reveal the complete velocity distribution which may be leveraged for more detailed diagnostics. Fig.\u00a010 shows the PW Doppler spectra for a mean radial flow velocity of 0.5m\/s from a \n\u2205\n10\u00a0mm orifice. The various flow velocities at each spatial location (depth) is easily evident by the spread of the PW spectra in the Y direction, and the amplitudes indicating the relative quantity of flow with specific velocity values. Further, the clutter at 0 velocity, which has been filtered out in this PW spectra, can also yield information about the flow velocity in the axial direction using Eq.\u00a0(3). The PW spectra at each depth location can be analyzed individually as seen in Fig.\u00a09 to extract the mean velocity estimates as discussed earlier.\n\nThe performance of PW Doppler on mean velocity estimates was further evaluated experimentally considering the constraints with respect to observation-window, pulse length and distance between the transducer and borehole wall.\n\n3.1.1\nEffect of observation-window on variance of mean velocity estimates\nThe observation-window directly influences the spatial resolution of PW Doppler when applied for LWD as explained in Section\u00a02.3. It is therefore desirable to have small observation-windows. However, the observation-window also influences the variance of mean velocity estimates by PW Doppler and the choice of an optimal observation-window is important. Experiments using the 10\u00a0mm circular orifice (Fig.\u00a03) and 0.3m\/s influx velocity (\n\u2248\n 23ml\/s) were repeated with different observation-windows and the variance in mean velocity estimates are plotted in Fig.\u00a011. The variance seems to be leveling off by a observation-window of about 150. The observation-windows as mentioned in Fig.\u00a011 are post clutter filtering of the RF signal and thus depending on the type of clutter filter used, the observation-window should be accordingly increased while acquisition. For our experiments, an FIR filter of order 50 was found to be the most optimal, so the observation-window must be increased by 50. A observation-window of 200, including the initialization of clutter filter, was used for all experiments discussed further. Section\u00a03.1.3 discusses a method to reduce the observation-window without compromising the variance in mean velocity estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2\nEffect of pulse-length on mean velocity estimates\nAs discussed earlier in Section\u00a02.2.4, the constraint due to the distance between the transducer and borehole wall require the use of short pulse-length. A 2D scan was done over the \n\u2205\n10\u00a0mm orifice plate (see Fig.\u00a03) for a radial flow velocity of 0.5m\/s and pulse-lengths equal to 2\n\n\u03bb\n and 4\n\n\u03bb\n. PW Doppler signals were acquired at 40 different points over the orifice and mean velocity estimates were calculated for each sample volume to obtain a mean velocity profile along the ultrasound beam axis. Fig.\u00a012 shows box plots for mean velocity estimates at each sample volume (depth) over the 40 PW Doppler signals for pulse-lengths equal to 2\n\n\u03bb\n and 4\n\n\u03bb\n. As expected, the standard deviation \n\u03c3\n in estimates is significantly higher for 2\n\n\u03bb\n at 0.2m\/s compared to 0.05m\/s for 4\n\n\u03bb\n. The number of outliers is also significantly higher at 47 for 2\n\n\u03bb\n compared to 12 for 4\n\n\u03bb\n.\n\nIt was also attempted to acquire signals with 1\n\n\u03bb\n pulse-length, but the signal quality was too poor for Doppler processing. Acquiring signals with 2\n\n\u03bb\n was also challenging albeit possible, however it is the authors\u2019 view that it would be practically difficult to implement under field conditions. Acquisitions with 4\n\n\u03bb\n were significantly stable and easy to obtain repeatedly. For water-based drilling fluids, this would translate to a sample volume of about 6\u00a0mm, and would be the most practical choice for field conditions.\nExperiments were repeated to find the lowest detectable radial flow velocity. Although there is no axial flow component in our experiments, the water jet naturally spreads out as it exits the orifice and causes some turbulence in the water chamber. This results in a broadening of the clutter signal as discussed earlier in Section\u00a02.2.2 and the bandwidth of the clutter filter needs to be sufficiently large to accommodate it. Considering this effect, radial flow velocities from the water influx of up to 0.2m\/s (15ml\/s from \n\u2205\n10\u00a0mm orifice) were easily measurable as shown in Fig.\u00a013.\n\nFundamentally there is no upper limit on the velocity measurement up to the Nyquist limit as discussed in Section\u00a02.2.2. This translates to a limit of 5.6m\/s for a 1MHz transducer at 15kHz. It was however not possible to experimentally validate this for LWD using our experimental setup as the water column becomes too unstable to manage when the velocity exceeds 0.5m\/s.\n\n\n3.1.3\nPolynomial regression filter for reducing observation-window\nThe results in Section\u00a03.1.1 suggest the use of a observation-window \u00bf150 for applying Doppler ultrasound in LWD. For a typical 6\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n\ninch tool moving at about 3rps, using Eq.\u00a0(5), this translates to a spatial resolution of about 16\u00a0mm for 150 signals at the maximum PRF limit of 15kHz. This may be sufficient as a go\/no-go detection for influx\/efflux, but is not sufficient when high resolution measurements are desired. It is possible to reduce the tool speed to for making high resolution scans, but it is desirable if this can be avoided.\nThe use of FIR filters for clutter suppression is very common due to its stability, linearity and time invariant properties. These types of filters however require samples equal to the filter order for initialization, which consequentially increases the observation-window. Polynomial regression filters are known to be used in color flow imaging where there is a similar requirement of small observation-windows for high frame rate imaging\u00a0(Leonov et al., 2019; Bjaerum et al., 2002). Polynomial regression filters have a steep frequency response and do not require additional samples for initialization, they are however not time invariant which makes it difficult to tune the filter to achieve a constant frequency response.\nA Savitzky\u2013Golay polynomial filter using the inbuilt MATLAB function \u201csgolayfilt\u201d was implemented on the Doppler recordings with 4\n\u03bb\n pulse-length discussed in Section\u00a02.2.4. A filter order of 10 with a \u2018framelength\u2019 equal to 2 sample volumes and a order 10 kaiser-windowed weighting vector was found to be performing optimally for our recordings. The mean velocity estimates and their \n\u03c3\n for different observation-windows are compared for a conventional kaiser-windowed FIR filter of order 50 (Fig.\u00a014) and the Savitzky\u2013Golay polynomial filter (Fig.\u00a015).\n\n\nThe performance of FIR filter deteriorates, as evidenced by the \n\u03c3\n, with a reduction in observation-window. The FIR filter order reduces the observation-window used for Doppler processing by 50 as discussed earlier and thus it was not possible to reduce the observation-window beyond 100. This considers that at least about 32 signals is the window length for Doppler processing as discussed in Section\u00a02.4. Comparing this to the Savitzky\u2013Golay polynomial filter, a minor improvement in \n\u03c3\n is observed for all observation-windows. Further, it was possible to reduce the observation-window up to 50, since no signals are lost in the initialization of the filter, without significant loss in measurement accuracy.\n\n\n\n3.2\nFissure geometry estimation\nUltrasonic LWD tools are routinely employed for obtaining high resolution images of the borehole wall with one of the important objectives directed at detecting the presence of fissures on the surface of the borehole wall. The imaging resolution of such fissures however is typically very low even for high-resolution LWD tools\u00a0(Li et al., 2019), partly because of the hardware limitations in incorporating such tools with the BHA. These ultrasonic LWD tools typically map the amplitude and travel time of the echo from the borehole wall for imaging.\n\nThe presence of fluid influx\/efflux from such fissures provides the opportunity to process the ultrasound signal in another way viz. the Doppler spectra, which can potentially be also used for imaging the geometry of such fissures. With this objective, 2D scans were performed, using a robotic scanner as described in Section\u00a02.1, on both the \n\n\u2205\n10\n\n orifice and 19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm slot orifice plates with influx flow velocity of 0.5\u00a0m\/s. The integral of the power of the IQ signal along the slow-time dimension at each measurement point was found to give the best SNR for geometry estimation and these are shown in Figs.\u00a016(a) and 16(c). A high SNR of about 30\u00a0dB can be observed between the region with influx (the orifice) and the regions away from the influx. Conventional backwall-amplitude images as used in LWD tools\u00a0(Li et al., 2019) were also generated from the same orifice plates as shown in Figs.\u00a016(b) and 16(d). The poor SNR of about 6\u00a0dB in these images is evident, and it is quite difficult to identify the orifices from these images. The backwall-amplitude maps in Figs.\u00a016(b) and 16(d) have several artifacts surrounding the orifice and are caused due to geometrical features within the experimental setup and would not exist in a typical borehole setting.\nFurther, the dimensions of the orifice was estimated using a threshold of 96th percentile for the IQ signal power integral shown in Figs.\u00a016(a) and 16(c). The estimated dimensions of the \n\n\u2205\n10\n\n orifice deviate by about \u22120.75mm in Y direction and \uff0b 0.4\u00a0mm in the X direction. The deviations for the 19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm slot orifice is about \uff0b 3.1\u00a0mm in Y direction and \u22120.2mm in X direction. The deviations in the estimate in Y direction for the 19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm slot orifice can be attributed to the point spread function (PSF) of the ultrasound transducer which is about 4\u00a0mm at 50\u00a0mm depth for the 1\/2inch, 1MHz unfocused transducer used in these experiments. The effect of the PSF is to diffuse out the edges in an ultrasound image and this consequently causes an overestimation in the dimensional estimates. The deviations in the other dimensional estimates are relatively small and can be attributed to the variance in the signal amplitudes in the images.\n\n\n\n4\nConclusion\nThe possibility of utilizing PW Doppler for the estimation of influx\/efflux flow velocities and the geometry of the fissures have been explored using a laboratory scale setup. An attempt has been made to define a set of boundary conditions for the application PW Doppler in a LWD setting.\nThe use of short pulse-lengths and packet sizes than what is conventionally used in PW Doppler is explored and their effect on the variance of velocity estimates has been demonstrated. It has been possible to obtain mean velocity estimates with a standard deviation of 0.05m\/s using a pulse-length of 4\n\n\u03bb\n. It is also possible to use a shorter pulse-length of 2\n\n\u03bb\n but at the expense of an increase in the standard deviation of mean velocity estimates to 0.2m\/s. Though this may be a very high error for quantitative purposes, it can be useful as a radial flow detection mode when the tool to borehole wall spacing is too small for example during a phase of high tool eccentricity. It is also demonstrated that influx velocities up to a lower limit of 0.2m\/s (15ml\/s from \n\u2205\n10\u00a0mm orifice) can be reliably estimated using PW Doppler.\nThe possibility of using alternative clutter filtering methods like the Savitzky\u2013Golay polynomial filter to reduce the observation-window of PW Doppler without any adverse impact on the accuracy of mean velocity estimates is demonstrated. This is particularly useful for real-time PW Doppler acquisition while drilling at speeds of about 1\u20133rps.\nLastly, the use of PW Doppler for imaging fissures and estimating their geometry with influx\/efflux in boreholes is demonstrated and compared with conventional pulse-echo amplitude imaging used in LWD tools. PW Doppler imaging delivered a significantly higher SNR of about 30\u00a0dB compared to an SNR of about 6\u00a0dB by conventional pulse-echo amplitude imaging. Although, PW Doppler is by far the superior method compared to pulse-echo amplitude imaging, it requires an active influx\/efflux from the fissure to be possible to apply. PW Doppler can thus be used as a complimentary tool in conjunction with conventional methods.\nThe experiments in this paper were aimed at exploring the possibility of using PW Doppler with conventional LWD tools and thus have been conducted using water as the working fluid for the sake of simplicity. Considering the promising results demonstrated in this work, further evaluation of the performance of PW Doppler using real drilling fluids of different properties should be the next step towards the deployment of this method for regular field use.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nShivanandan Indimath: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization.

This ratio is fundamental in determining the flow regime along the pipe, as well as in tuning the appropriate fluid processing at the receiving terminal plant, in order to guarantee the efficiency and safety of the assets.\nThe need to model and predict the variability of multiphase propagation has been broadly addressed in the literature (Brennen, 2005; Henry et al., 1971; Hsu, 1972; Gudmundsson and Celius, 1999; Kumar et al., 2020). A fully theoretical approach, consisting in using mathematical equations and analytical models, cannot be employed in a real scenario, due to the impossibility of knowing the initial status and the governing equations with the required accuracy (Falcone and Alimonti, 2007; Agwu et al., 2022; Taylor, 1935). Other solutions make use of numerical simulations or experimental setups arranged in laboratories, which lack validation on real scenarios (Andrade et al., 2022; Chaves et al., 2022). The current frontier is instead represented by computational methods (Yan et al., 2018; Babakhani Dehkordi, Colombo, Guilizzoni and Sotgia, 2017), which employ models driven by the data, either available in the literature (Kanin et al., 2018; Alhashem, 2019; Al-Naser et al., 2016; Alhashem, 2020; Kanin et al., 2019; Gene et al., 2019), generated synthetically (Andrianov, 2018; Babanezhad et al., 2020) or collected from real transportation assets (Aziz AL-Qutami et al., 2018; G\u00f3es et al., 2021; Ye and Guo, 2013; Qiang et al., 2021).\nWhat emerges from the research survey just discussed is that a lot of attention currently stands towards virtual flow metering systems (Bikmukhametov and J\u00e4schke, 2020) or flow rate estimation in multiphase pipeline systems, yet (according to the best of the Authors\u2019 knowledge) the current literature is rather poor with regards to successfully tracking and monitoring the location of multiphase fluid batches\/slugs: even though the latter is an equally important matter, it still remains a quite unexplored area of study. The work presented here fills such a research gap by proposing a data-driven methodology that allows to follow the position of diverse oil-gas mixtures moving along a pipeline at the velocity of the fluid flow. Our proposed method starts from a practical example to highlight its effective applicability on real scenarios: as such, we consider pressure signals collected by Eni for two full months (February 2020 and March 2020) in discrete locations along a 7.8\u00a0km oil-gas multiphase transportation asset located in Italy. We have designed and tested several features, directly derived from the collected pressure data, which are able to describe the variability of the multiphase batches flowing along the conduit. Such features are tuned for tracking a given sequence of mixtures along consecutive acquisition stations: the latter task is performed by a supervised learning model, based on Extremely Randomized Trees (Geurts et al., 2006). As said, the main technical novelty of our approach consists in an automated tagging and tracking process of the different multiphase slugs that enter\/exit the pipeline, along with the opportunity to track their position and movement along the pipe. Besides that, our methodology is based on cheap and standard pressure measurements, which are typically already installed in many pipeline assets; it leverages on a simple machine learning algorithm; compared to most research works in the topic of oil\/gas multiphase propagation, we have worked with an experimental dataset that is concurrently large enough (more than 15 billion examples) and collected from a real pipeline transportation system. Other key elements are an accurate synchronization of the measurements, the real time transmission and multichannel processing of the data.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides an overview of the case study. Section III describes the processing steps applied to the data, whereas Section IV and Section V respectively explain how to tag and track oil-gas mixtures. Lastly, Section VI draws the conclusions.\n\n\n2\nCase study description\nThe work presented here makes use of pressure data collected for two months (from February 1st, 2020 to April 1st, 2020) by a proprietary vibroacoustic continuous monitoring system (e-vpms\u00ae technology (United States of America Patent No. US10401254B2, 2019)), installed on an upstream oil & gas network located in South Italy, which conveys a mixture of gas and oil products. The flowline has a length of approximately 7.8\u00a0km with altimetric variance, is characterized by 12\u201d ID pipes and continuously operates with a service pressure comprised between 30 and 44\u00a0bar.\nThe gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) typically ranges between 50 and 250, with an average value of approximately 200, based on separator measurements collected on-site. Fig. 1\n displays the satellite track of the conduit (red curve) and the location of the three acquisition stations installed on the line itself (highlighted by yellow pins and respectively labelled as A, B and C). The production well (A) is upstream with respect to the Oil Centre (C). Each e-vpms\u00ae sensing unit is equipped with a dynamic hydrophone, which records pressure transients within the multiphase fluid. The sampling rate has been set to 1\u00a0kHz: recalling that the acquisition time spans over two full months (e.g., 60 days), the total number of recorded samples per sensor is more than 5 billion. Table 1\n reports the relative distance between each acquisition unit and the production terminal installed at station A.\nIn a pipeline fluid transportation system, every interaction with the pipe or with the flow generates acoustic signals that propagate as guided waves within the fluid itself. Considering multiphase pipelines, a sensor in contact with the fluid (e.g., an hydrophone) can measure pressure transients (i.e., sounds) having different characteristics according to the variable gas\/liquid ratio of the moving mixture: during a normal operation regime, the related pressure fluctuations are neither constant nor periodic, yet their statistical features can be analyzed and exploited, using data-driven techniques, to define one or more propagation regimes.\nGiven such a context, two distinct acoustic propagation processes have been observed. The first one is related to pressure transients generated by the flow regulation equipment (e.g., pumps, valves, etc.): these transients propagate within the pipe at the sound velocity \n\n\nv\ns\n\n\n depending on the type of fluid transported. More specifically, if the pipe was entirely filled with gas, one would observe a propagation velocity of a few hundred m\/s; if one instead conveys liquid oil, \n\n\nv\ns\n\n\n would be around 1000\u00a0m\/s. Considering oil-gas mixtures, the sound speed exhibits the behavior shown in Fig. 2\n (Unalmis, 2015): it is clear that sound velocity measurements can be exploited to estimate the gas-oil ratio. In principle, \n\n\nv\ns\n\n\n is obtainable by a correlation analysis between the pressure transients recorded at different stations, as shown in (Bernasconi and Giunta, 2020): a correlation peak happens at the relative propagation delay of the considered stations. Unfortunately, in high GOR regimes (like in our case, the average GOR is around 200) the propagation is very chaotic and turbulent due to the dominant presence of gas: as a consequence, pressure transients tend to decorrelate very rapidly (after a few hundred m) such that the aforementioned technique cannot be employed to estimate \n\n\nv\ns\n\n\n. We have in fact verified this aspect on our experimental datasets by correlating the signals collected at the two closest stations (e.g., A and B), obtaining unsatisfactory outcomes.\nThe second propagation process is instead related to the fluid flowing within the line, which travels at the flow velocity \n\n\nv\nf\n\n\n of some m\/s: for instance, a batch of oil-gas mixture travelling at such a speed would be observed at two distinct sensing stations (e.g., A and C) with a time difference of several minutes or hours. In this case, the ability of tracking a given batch along the line permits to measure the flow velocity. The following Sections present an automatic procedure, fed with pressure data recorded in stations A, B and C along the pipeline, able to tag and track the batches of produced fluid travelling along the line.\n\n\n3\nData processing\nAs a first step, raw pressure measurements (displayed in Fig. 3\n\n) undergo a number of preliminary operations to make them suitable for a machine learning workflow. For this specific application, we have performed the following tasks:\n\n1)\nRemoval of outliers and sensor errors (Giro et al., 2021a, 2021b; Giunta et al., 2020). More precisely, dynamic pressure measurements having absolute value greater than 100\u00a0kPa have been ruled out from the dataset. In addition, all the time intervals in which a sensor was not operational have been manually detected and the corresponding data points have been set to a null value. All those instances (highlighted in Fig. 3 with black ellipses) are related to sporadic electromagnetic disturbances affecting the power unit of the equipment;\n\n\n2)\nBandpass filtering pressure data between 0.2 and 1\u00a0Hz. This operation has a dual purpose: firstly, to remove the zero-frequency component, which would introduce an undesired bias in the measurements; lastly, to keep the useful part of the observed signal (which is typically below 1\u00a0Hz) and to reduce the noise bandwidth. The useful bandwidth of the signal has been empirically derived by performing numerous correlations of the original signals within different frequency sub bands, and we concluded that the frequency range (0.2\u00a0Hz, 1\u00a0Hz) is the optimal one from a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) point of view. We also recall that the attenuation of sounds increases with frequency, and for this reason it makes more sense to keep the low frequency component of the data, rather than its high-frequency counterpart: in this specific case, the SNR above 1\u00a0Hz is degraded to a point that it\u2019s not worth considering the corresponding frequency components;\n\n\n3)\nEqualization. This operation is the reversal of distortion which occurs whenever a signal is transmitted through a channel: more specifically, equalizers are used to flatten the frequency response of such a signal within a desired frequency range; this means that the propagation channel (e.g., the pipe) progressively introduces distortion and degrades the quality of the target signal to be measured. In practice, if we were to use the raw pressure data, we would not be able to successfully track the multiphase slugs that propagate along the pipeline (the signal would get lost after a certain distance): for these reasons, equalization is a key step within the data processing phase. In this particular case, the pressure signals collected at the three different stations are each affected by local noise which alters their spectral content within the bandwidth of interest (0.2\u20131\u00a0Hz) in an undesired manner: this aspect can be observed by looking at the power spectral density (PSD) of the raw pressure data (Fig. 4, plots on the left column). Such an inhomogeneity is also visible in the time series (Fig. 3), which are characterized by non-uniform scales among each other: this aspect can become problematic during the training and testing phases of a machine learning algorithm (Danushka, 2017). To overcome this issue, we have whitened each PSD between 0.2 and 1\u00a0Hz using an equalizer based on Welch's method (Welch, 1967). The result of such an operation is displayed in Fig. 4 (plots on the right column).\n\n\n\nIn addition, it should also be noted that there are missing data points in the pressure time series represented in Fig. 3 (e.g., between March 14th and March 21st): the latter are related to the instances in which the acquisition units were temporarily not operational. Lastly, Fig. 5\n displays the data collected by the dynamic hydrophones at their respective stations after the processing operations previously described. The historical data devoted to train and test the machine learning model are highlighted in Fig. 5 using text boxes and a black vertical line.\n\n\n4\nTagging oil-gas mixtures\nBy looking at the time series in Fig. 5, two distinct multiphase regimes can be detected: the former and most frequent one (Fig. 6\n, outside two vertical bars) can be distinguished from the latter (Fig. 6, enclosed by black vertical bars) as the recorded pressure signals present a different acoustic energy content. We can qualitatively label such regimes as \u201chigh energy\u201d and \u201clow energy\u201d. It is also worth noting (by looking at the example in Fig. 6) that each transition from one state to another is observed at the three sensing stations with a relative delay \n\n\u03c4\n\n of approximately 30\u00a0min between each other. Taking into account the relative distances reported in Table 1, it is reasonable to assume that these changes are due to variations in the composition of the flowing product: based on the on-site production logs, it is in fact expected to propagate on average with a velocity \n\n\nv\nf\n\n\n of approximately 2\u00a0m\/s.\nThe two different batches of oil-gas mixtures present therefore unique acoustic signatures, whose characteristics can be directly extracted from the recorded data: for instance, higher order statistical moments of pressure measurements (such as variance) are good candidates to characterize the flow regime along the entire pipeline. We have therefore exploited this observational knowledge to manually tag each of the time series displayed in Fig. 5 with a binary label, which univocally identifies one of the two oil-gas batches. An example of such an operation is depicted in Fig. 7\n, where every sample of the signals displayed in Fig. 6 has been assigned a tag: the datapoints corresponding to the high energy state (e.g., state 1) have been colored in black, while the remaining ones (state 2) have been represented in magenta.\n\n4.1\nOn the need for supervision\nWhenever this category of problems is tackled using a data-driven approach, a common argument might question the need for employing machine learning in the first place: since we have just said that the variance of the signal can be a valid indicator to distinguish between the two propagation regimes, one could simply evaluate the aforementioned quantity over two different windows, and the detection of a large variation in the data can be set as the discriminant between state 1 and state 2. However, deterministic methods (such as this one) tend to be less reliable the more uncertain the decision threshold becomes (what is exactly a large enough variation in the data to be eligible for tagging?): this would either result in classification ambiguity or in the requirement for human supervision. Let us consider the example displayed in Fig. 8\n: in this case, it is not trivial to decide for state 1 or state 2 using a simple moving variance, because it is not clear where to put the threshold on the variance level. The machine learning method presented in Section V overcomes this limitation: it will be demonstrated that its capability to generalize well enough can make the data-driven model more likely to be deployed in other assets. A moving variance-based solution, instead, would certainly require specific calibration for each new scenario.\nAnother problem that cannot be solved by basic techniques regards the presence of acoustic events that do not propagate with the same velocity of the flow: these processes still generate significant amplitude variations in the measured signals, yet they do not have any relation with multiphase batches travelling through the pipe. In Section II, we have also stated that such pressure transients decorrelate very rapidly after a few hundred m and are not visible at successive stations: as a result, a basic technique that blindly looks at the moving variance would trigger a false event at a given station, and would remain silent for all the others. For all the reasons just described, it is therefore of paramount importance to correctly tag the data and feed them to an expert system: the aim is to automatically detect and track only coherent events, ruling out all the false alarms. Deterministic techniques, instead, cannot simply provide the required level of abstraction typical of machine learning algorithms.\n\nFig. 9\n shows an example instance of the problem just discussed: an acoustic event (enclosed by black vertical bars) occurs at station A on March 2nd, 2020 before 8:30 in the morning, yet it is not visible at any of the successive stations; this event was caused by the flow regulation equipment (located at station A) and was not related to changes in the gas\/oil fraction. It is clear that blindly looking at the amplitude of the signal would erroneously highlight a variation in the multiphase composition: a machine learning model can instead learn to detect the propagation phenomena of interest (e.g., the ones related to multiphase propagation), while concurrently discarding false events (such as the one depicted in Fig. 9) if trained appropriately.\n\n\n\n5\nTracking oil-gas mixtures\nBy having labelled data at disposal, one can employ such tags to train a supervised learning classifier, having two practical applications in mind: firstly, the real time tracking of the position of different oil-gas batches moving along the conduit; lastly, the automatic identification of the type of mixture currently entering\/exiting the line. To perform these operations, we have employed a multi-output Extremely Randomized Trees Classifier (ERTC) (Geurts et al., 2006): the latter is a data-driven algorithm which provides (at each sampling instant) three discrete outputs by analyzing several characteristics of the input signal. For this specific application, the classifier has been designed to provide binary labels, which respectively identify (for each of the three stations) one of the two flow regimes previously discussed. We have chosen to employ the ERTC because it can concurrently satisfy the following requirements: it must be reliable, accurate and robust; it must have the simplest implementation possible; it must be based on basic and easy to understand principles. Moreover, a properly trained ERTC can choose autonomously which features are more appropriate for a particular slug\/state combination: this feature importance evaluation process is a peculiar property of the algorithm itself, and makes it very reliable from a performance point of view.\nBesides a \n\nm\n\u00d7\n3\n\n matrix of ground truth labels \n\ny\n\n (i.e., the \n\nm\n\n manually tagged examples times 3 measurement stations), the classifier requires as additional input a \n\nm\n\u00d7\nN\n\n matrix of features \n\nX\n\n, where the \n\nN\n\n entries of each row are obtained by evaluating several statistical indicators from the dynamic pressure signals: more specifically, we have computed the variance, minimum and maximum over 12 causal rolling windows, ranging from 5\u00a0min up to 5\u00a0h; therefore, each training example \n\n\nx\nk\n\n\n is described by a \n\n1\n\u00d7\nN\n\n row vector, where \n\nN\n=\n108\n\n. Table 2\n summarizes the 108 raw features that have been evaluated from the processed pressure data. The procedure is described as follows: at each time step \n\nk\n\n, one has to evaluate \n\n\nx\ni\n\n\n, where \n\ni\n\u2208\n\n[\n\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\n108\n\n]\n\n\n. For example, \n\n\nx\n1\n\n\n corresponds to the variance of the pressure transients recorded at station A over the previous 5\u00a0min (e.g., an interval between \n\nk\n\n \u2013 5\u00a0min and \n\nk\n\n), \n\n\nx\n2\n\n\n is the same statistics but computed over the past 15\u00a0min, and so on.\nThe aforementioned feature engineering process follows this logic: if we had to manually look at the pressure measurements and decide between the two classes \u201cstate 1\u201d and \u201cstate 2\u201d, we would look at the current shape of the signal (e.g., visually assessing its variance, minimum and maximum values) and compare it with its past history: the definition of \u201cpast history\u201d varies widely, since a certain type of slug (or, equivalently, GOR) can last from several minutes up to a few hours (based on our experimental data). We have therefore carefully designed the ERTC with this logic in mind: we wanted the algorithm to react like we typically do and to automatically perform a task that would otherwise be done by hand, which ultimately takes a lot of time and experience to be executed correctly.\nWorking in high-dimensional spaces (e.g., having a lot of features) can potentially be undesirable for many reasons: in particular, training a machine learning algorithm using too many features is usually computationally cumbersome and does not guarantee a better performance of the algorithm itself. Given the high cardinality of our feature space (\n\nN\n>\n100\n\n), we have therefore performed dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2005) to find a smaller feature set \n\n\nX\n\u2032\n\n\n having size \n\nm\n\u00d7\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n\n (where \n\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n<\nN\n\n), while still preserving most of the variance from the original data. In practice, the raw feature matrix \n\nX\n\n undergoes an orthogonal linear transformation which maps the data into a new coordinate system having \n\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n\n components: we have therefore applied PCA on \n\nX\n\n with the goal of preserving at least 90% of the original variance of the data. By accepting a tradeoff with a small loss of information (e.g., 10% variance reduction), a substantial dimensionality reduction can be obtained: in fact, the minimum value of \n\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n\n that satisfies this condition is \n\n\nN\n\u2032\n\n=\n7\n\n, thus achieving a compression factor greater than 15. We also remind that PCA does not eliminate any of the initial features per se, it simply combines them to create a new set of features, smaller than the former one. Fig. 10\n represents the outcome of PCA on our experimental data: as with many real world problems, the boundaries between the two target classes (e.g., state 1 and state 2) are not always clear: this is one of the reasons why basic, deterministic solutions are not good enough to correctly tag and track multiphase mixtures. Still, some dense and distinct regions in the PCA domain can be detected (e.g., the density plots below the magenta histograms entitled \u201cPC1\u201d and \u201cPC2\u201d): this confirms that our subset of 7 transformed features are useful indicators for distinguishing the two multiphase regimes of interest.\nThe multi-output ERTC has been trained for a full calendar month (February 2020) using examples collected from all three stations. Training a data-driven model using this type of approach becomes advantageous, since we can embed the notions of spatial and temporal memory into the ERTC, which are respectively provided by the multi-output design and by computing the feature matrix using only moving, causal statistics. Testing has instead been performed on the remaining time frame (March 2020): given the abundance of available examples (>5 billion), an equal subdivision between the two sets proves to be sufficient, as it guarantees enough samples for training the algorithm, allows for a thorough testing phase and makes it easier to detect any potential issues with bias or overfitting the data to the training set. Moreover, performance can be either assessed on the overall test set or it can be further refined by treating the three measurement stations as independent of each other: the latter approach permits to detect in which locations the classifier provides the highest or the lowest accuracy. Lastly, by having multi-point outputs at disposal, one can also infer the mean composition of the multiphase batch along the entire pipeline and\/or individual segments: the overall GOR at a specific time instant is obtained by averaging the output tags, weighted by the length of each line section.\nTo assess the performance of the proposed mixture tracking model, we have considered the typical metrics employed in statistical analysis of binary classification, namely: precision \n\nP\n\n, recall \n\nR\n\n and \n\n\nF\n1\n\n\n score. Those quantities are a function of the number of true positives \n\n\nT\np\n\n\n, false positives \n\n\nF\np\n\n\n and false negatives \n\n\nF\nn\n\n\n, and are respectively defined as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n=\n\n\nT\np\n\n\n\nT\np\n\n+\n\nF\np\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n=\n\n\nT\np\n\n\n\nT\np\n\n+\n\nF\nn\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n1\n\n=\n2\n\nPR\n\nP\n+\nR\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n reports the values of \n\nP\n\n, \n\nR\n\n and \n\n\nF\n1\n\n\n, respectively attained for each binary class and for the three test sets considered (data collected from stations A, B and C). The results are quite satisfactory, as the overall accuracy level (Table 3, lowermost row) is greater than 97% for every test set considered. Such a high degree of robustness can also be observed by comparing the time series of the predicted tags with the ground truth, reference values. An example is displayed in Fig. 11\n: the outputs of the ERTC (Fig. 11, bottom row) closely match the original labels (Fig. 11, top row).\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThis paper presented a novel machine learning strategy which has been applied to historical pressure data for tracking sequences of oil-gas multiphase mixtures, conveyed along a pipeline in an upstream scenario. The proposed work demonstrates that the position of such mixtures can be successfully monitored, since each slug presents a characteristic propagation signature which is strongly dependent on the composition of the mixture itself: this allows to precisely describe the high variability in the operational statuses of the pipeline. Having a mixture of fluids in a pipeline brings many challenges due to the individual characteristics of each phase: for example, reactions between different components can cause corrosion of the pipeline, which leads to leaks and ruptures; moreover, these could potentially go unnoticed if occurring in a subsea pipeline, where it is not possible to install physical meters. Another critical issue consists in appropriately preparing the receiving terminal to optimally process the incoming multiphase mixture, which is a key step in ensuring the safety of operations: given such a context, knowing its real-time composition is an important requirement; our tracking system can provide such an information, and additionally allows for virtual flow rate metering along the entire conduit. In fact, the model has been designed and validated on experimental data, collected for two months from a real pipeline asset. Results obtained so far confirm the capability of tracking different oil-gas mixtures at an intermediate point and at the two ends of a conduit, achieving an overall accuracy level greater than 97% for all the test sets considered. Future work will be focused on testing the data-driven model presented here in other oil & gas pipeline networks.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nRiccardo Angelo Giro: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.

Developing smaller fields is associated not only with lower profits, but also with more risks\u00a0(Dias, 2004). Field development decisions have to be made facing relatively more subsurface uncertainty because of the high cost of drilling appraisal wells compared to the expected revenues of small prospects.\nA standard way to develop a small offshore field is to connect it to existing infrastructure\u00a0(NPD, 2020). This can significantly reduce capital expenditures needed to develop a satellite field and increase revenues of already installed infrastructure due to tariffs paid to the facility owner. However, in some cases it is not possible to use a tie-back solution. This is the case if a discovery is located too far from already installed production facilities. Other reasons could be some capacity constraints and technological challenges that make the tie-back too costly\u00a0(Lei et al., 2021).\nIn this paper, we develop a method to evaluate the opportunity to use a single production unit to develop several small offshore fields sequentially. We analyze sequential development as a cost-efficient solution allowing exploration and production (E&P) companies to manage uncertainty in a small field development process and capture the value of flexibility. We analyze a project case where an oil company holds two independent licenses, A and B, that both represent small oil fields located relatively far away from the existing production infrastructure. If implemented, the development solution must provide a basis for the stand-alone production of each discovery. The idea is that a movable platform or a floating production and operation unit is used to develop the two fields sequentially.\nWe first analyze whether sequential production is more beneficial than the parallel development of Fields A and B using two production units. For the sequential investment, two different approaches can be used to estimate the project value under uncertainty. The first one implies that the decision maker disregards the opportunity to learn about the development of such factors as the oil price, expected production rate of Field B and CAPEX to switch between two fields during the production phase of Field A and maximizes the recovery factor of Field A first, independent of the potential of Field B. Once Field A is depleted (or starts generating a negative cash flow), the field is decommissioned and facilities are moved to develop Field B. We refer to this approach as \u201cmyopic\u201d. The second approach allows optimizing the switching decision due to learning about the uncertain factors and, if optimal, switch from Field A to Field B at a different time than suggested by the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach. We refer to the second approach for the valuation as the \u201coptions\u201d approach as it is based on real options analysis. Overall, four types of uncertainty are considered to have an impact on the switching decision: oil price, production level, OPEX and CAPEX to switch. Although the same factors are used as input for the valuation under the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, the main difference between the two approaches is that within the \u201coptions\u201d approach the valuation procedure accounts for the decision maker\u2019s ability to change the course of the project based on the updated knowledge. The switching decision can be triggered by, for example, a low level of drilling CAPEX that is needed to start developing Field B. If this CAPEX is expected to increase, the optimal strategy might be to switch as soon as possible. In case information reveals an unfavorable outcome, i.e.\u00a0low expected recoverable reserves of Field B, the operator can also decide to leave Field B undeveloped. The main problem that we consider in this case is the project valuation using the switching decision optimization based on updated information about the uncertain factors.\nIn order to allow for a fair comparison of the sequential and parallel development strategies, using both the \u201cmyopic\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d approaches, we use the same inputs to simulate project cash flows. We use the production optimization based an oriented workflow to address the reservoir uncertainty and generate 50 probable realizations of the oil production profiles of each of the two fields. The underlying reservoir model represents the benchmark case, Olympus, introduced by\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018). The production optimization based on the Olympus case also yields realizations of the water injection and water production rates that impact the level of OPEX. In order to replicate the development of future oil price, we use a two-factor stochastic process presented in\u00a0Schwartz and Smith (2000). The CAPEX components are modeled as geometric Brownian motion (GBM) processes correlated with the long-term oil price parameter, which allows the avoidance of bias in the valuation procedure. For the valuation of the parallel development and sequential development using the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, a rather simple discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation is used. For the \u201coptions\u201d approach, we apply the least-squares Monte Carlo approach\u00a0(Longstaff and Schwartz, 2001) to evaluate the project based on switching time optimization under uncertainty.\nAs\u00a0Cortazar et al. (2021) point out, the solution to the switching problem is twofold: \u201cthe maximized expected profit given by the flexible operation, and the underlying decision policy, which is defined in terms of a set of switching boundaries triggering regime transitions\u201d. Applying the \u201coptions\u201d approach allows us to provide insight on both considerations making our results relevant for real-world problem settings. Our results show that for a specific case study, the sequential production is a preferred option compared to the parallel production. We also demonstrate that the \u201coptions\u201d approach is an important tool to capture the value of flexibility when the sequential production strategy is considered. By accounting for the opportunity to tune the switching strategy depending on the information revelation, the decision maker can significantly increase the expected project value.\nIn this paper, we contribute to the literature focusing on petroleum investment under uncertainty and applications of the real options approach (ROA) focusing on switching options in oil and gas field development. The switching option is one of the classic types of real options that finds various applications in natural resource production problems. A number of contributions study end of the lifetime decisions for fields and focus on the oil-to-gas production switching option.\u00a0Hahn and Dyer (2008) evaluate a switching option from only oil production to combined oil and gas production in the North Slope of Alaska.\u00a0Hahn and Dyer (2008) use two correlated one-factor mean reverting processes to model oil and gas prices to determine the optimal course of action considering the switching decision. They derive the value of the asset with flexibility using a binomial lattice method and deterministic production model.\u00a0Hem et al. (2011) and\u00a0Thomas and Bratvold (2015) also evaluate the switching from oil production to gas production in a depleting field, assuming that oil and gas prices follow two-factor stochastic processes\u00a0(Schwartz and Smith, 2000).\u00a0Hem et al. (2011) use a zero-dimensional reservoir model to replicate the production uncertainty, whereas\u00a0Thomas and Bratvold (2015) use deterministic input from a material balance simulator. Both studies employ the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method to optimize the switching timing and obtain the option values.\u00a0Hem et al. (2011) and\u00a0Thomas and Bratvold (2015) also compare results based on ROA and simplistic DCF analysis where the switching decision is made ignoring the opportunity to learn about the uncertainty in the future.\u00a0Hong et al. (2019) use the LSM algorithm to analyze the optimal switch time from primary recovery method to the improved oil recovery. The geological uncertainty, described by a two-factor production model, is considered to be the only source of uncertainty for the switching decision.\u00a0Hong et al. (2019) compare the project value under the state-of-the-art reservoir management approach and the proposed LSM method considering the impact of future information on switching time.\nWe also contribute to the literature that presents work on the value of flexibility in oil field development. Contributions in this field include\u00a0Dias (2004),\u00a0Suslick and Schiozer (2004),\u00a0Lin et al. (2013),\u00a0Santos et al. (2018, 2021), among others. In this paper, we analyze the economic effect of a field development strategy that can be highly relevant for stand-alone small discoveries. To the best of our knowledge, the sequential production strategy has not been evaluated before. We also contribute to previous research methodologically by accounting for four types of uncertainty that affect the optimal decision: geological, oil price, operational and capital expenditure. Moreover, compared to the existing contributions, we provide a much more practice-oriented and realistic modeling approach to reservoir uncertainty by means of the production optimization based on the Olympus case. This makes our method more relevant for real-life problem settings. We demonstrate how to utilize the results of production optimization in the real options valuation procedure and decision-making process. Consequently, we extend the above-mentioned contributions, which mostly use simplistic approaches for the reservoir uncertainty modeling and account only for at most two types of uncertainty. Our analysis shows that the LSM approach is able to handle such an amount of uncertain factors within the valuation procedure. At the same time, the results that the LSM approach provides, are still intuitive enough to be used for the decision support. Despite the complexity of the problem, we obtain a tractable decision rule for making a switch between two licenses. We also contribute to the literature by modeling the CAPEX and the oil price as two correlated stochastic processes.\u00a0Cardenas et al. (2018) argue that the effect of the correlation between oil price and capital costs on the project valuation is not thoroughly studied in the literature.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\u00a02, we describe the investment problem that an oil company faces when considering a sequential investment in the development of two hydrocarbon fields. In Section\u00a03, we formulate and develop the modeling approach for the valuation of the project under both parallel and sequential development. For the \u201coptions\u201d approach we introduce the optimization algorithm to evaluate the option to switch between two licenses. In Section\u00a04, we introduce a case study, providing a detailed description of the Olympus reservoir case and assumptions regarding the oil price and cost uncertainty modeling. Section\u00a05 presents the results and sensitivity analysis. Section\u00a06 concludes the paper.\n\n\n2\nProblem statement\nAn oil company is evaluating whether to invest in the development of two oil field licenses offshore Norway. We assume that the two fields are identical in terms of the reservoir characteristics. Therefore, we disregard the assessment of which field should be developed first to maximize the overall value. This assumption can be straightforwardly relaxed by adding a different underlying reservoir model that can represent the range of reservoir uncertainty in Field B. This would also require to choose the optimal development sequence, identifying which field should be developed first. However, in most of the cases, it will be optimal to develop a field with higher expected initial oil in place.\n\n\n\nDue to the remoteness from existing infrastructure, only stand alone development can be considered in both cases. A conventional approach using two different production units to develop Fields A and B in parallel might be both costly and risky due to prominent reservoir uncertainty and the small size of the individual discoveries. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a01, we analyze whether a sequential development of the two licenses with a single production facility can improve their revenues and decrease the downside risk of the project sufficiently to make the development economically viable. For the sequential development, a flexible production and operation unit that can be moved from the Field A to the Field B location must be considered. This strategy significantly reduces the risk of occurrence of stranded assets if both or one of the fields\u2019 reservoir performance proves to be much lower than expected, making the production unit unemployed. Therewith, apart from saving capital costs, the sequential strategy can contribute to the implementation of the policies aiming to reduce the environmental impact of petroleum production.\n1\n\n\n1\nThis includes the UN sustainability goals, the European Green Deal, and Norwegian climate action plan in particular. Delaying Field B production can also allow using novel solutions for carbon capture and implement production facility electrification using offshore wind to decrease the carbon footprint from operations.\n The central question in terms of the sequential development strategy is determining the time when Field A should be abandoned and the production unit moved to develop Field B. Having the flexibility to leave Field B undeveloped can be also highly valuable if additional information turns out to eventually render the investment uneconomical.\nThe first approach that can be used is to maximize the recovery factor of the Field A and decommission it once it has depleted enough to be economically non-viable to be developed further. We refer to this strategy as the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach. Fig.\u00a02 illustrates the project timeline under the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach.\nThe second approach implies that the oil company maximizes the value of the overall project rather than maximizing only the revenue generated by Field A. We refer to this as the \u201coptions\u201d approach. Intuitively, the optimal decision in some scenarios might be to switch to Field B production at a different time than suggested by the first approach. This decision can be driven by the state of several factors, including the oil price, the expected remaining reserves of Field A, expected production of Field B, the level of OPEX of Field A and CAPEX needed to switch from Field A to B. The possibility to learn about these factors over time can also allow assessing whether the investment in Field B is profitable. Fig.\u00a03 illustrates that starting from year \n\n\nY\n\n\ns\n\n\n, the earliest point when the regulator can approve the abandonment of Field A upon reaching a certain recovery factor, the field operator decides whether it is optimal to \u201cexercise\u201d the option to switch from Field A to Field B or to continue developing Field A and reevaluate the decision at the next decision point. If the expected values of both decisions are negative; i.e.,\u00a0prolonging the production of Field A and switching to Field B, the field operator can decommission Field A and leave Field B undeveloped. Our goal is to identify whether accounting for the switching flexibility can affect the results of the project valuation based on the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach and impact the choice between the \u201cparallel\u201d and \u201csequential\u201d development strategies.\nWe use the Olympus benchmark case as an underlying reservoir model for both fields to capture the effect of production uncertainty on the decision-making process and project valuation. Both fields are considered to be small discoveries with estimated recoverable reserves ranging from 51.6 to 107.5 mmbbl throughout 50 equally probable realizations of the reservoir uncertainty (mean of 82.6 mmbbl).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThis section describes the key components of the proposed valuation of the investment in two oil fields. The valuation is based on a simulation approach. Fig.\u00a04 illustrates the main building blocks and states the output produced by each block as well as the information flow between individual blocks.\n\nIn this paper, we use an ensemble of 50 realizations of the Olympus benchmark reservoir model\n2\n\n\n2\nBenchmark reservoir models are developed by the reservoir optimization community to test methods for field development optimization under geological uncertainty. Using the benchmark cases allows the standardization of the set of models, problem definition and objective function calculation. This makes the comparison of results proposed by different researchers fair. It also provides consensus on best practices for field development optimization.\n to estimate the possible outcomes of the hydrocarbon production. Based on the benchmark case data and drainage strategy described in\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018), we perform the production optimization (see Section\u00a03.1) that yields 50 realizations of oil and water production and water injection rates of Field A that maximize the economic value of the field development under static conditions (fixed oil price and control parameters). In order to make our results less case-dependent and decrease the complexity of the production optimization task, we assume that Field A and Field B are identical in terms of reservoir properties. That means that we use the same 50 realizations to replicate the reservoir uncertainty of Field B.\nThen we proceed to the valuation of the parallel and sequential production strategies, where we account for several additional uncertain factors that can affect the decision making process. Section\u00a03.2 describes the oil price simulation process. In the case of the parallel development, the oil price level affects only the abandonment time of Fields A and B. In the sequential development, the decision maker would optimize the switching timing between the two fields (within the \u201coptions\u201d approach) taking into account the oil price level, CAPEX and information regarding expected production of Field B. The simulated production profiles and oil prices also impact the level of OPEX and CAPEX. The estimation process is described in Section\u00a03.3. Combining the output of the modeling blocks, we simulate the project cash flows and perform the project valuation under parallel and sequential production. For the latter case, cash flows for both the \u201cmyopic\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d approaches are simulated. Within the \u201coptions\u201d approach, these cash flows are used for the switching time optimization (see Section\u00a03.4) and valuation of the project with flexibility.\n\n3.1\nProduction optimization\nOne of the main factors driving risk in small field development is the reservoir uncertainty. In this paper we use the Olympus benchmark case presented in\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018) as an underlying reservoir model in order to build the oil production forecast for Field A and Field B. Clearly, considering two different underlying reservoir models in order to relax the assumption regarding the fact that Fields A and B are identical, would increase the production optimization task. The performance and run time of the economic valuation model presented in Section\u00a03.4, however, is not expected to be affected by that.\nThe uncertainty about the reservoir properties in the Olympus case allows us to account for reservoir uncertainty when evaluating field development strategies. Probabilistic approaches have been widely used in the literature in recent years in order to capture the full uncertainty range by generating a set of geological realizations (Correia et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2018; Mahjour et al., 2019, 2022). In addition to the oil production profiles, we derive good estimates for the level of water production and water injection, which directly impact the level of OPEX. In this section we discuss the proposed production optimization algorithm. More details on the Olympus case and specific parameter values used for the optimization procedure are provided in Section\u00a04.1, where we introduce the case study, which is used to illustrate the application of the proposed valuation methodology.\nIn order to estimate the production parameters, we use well control optimization, optimizing the bottom hole pressure (BHP) of the producer and injector wells when implementing water flooding (WF). WF is chosen as a default recovery strategy by\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018) who originally introduced the Olympus challenge. The well control optimization is considered as one of the most attractive approaches for increasing the recovery factors and the associated profits while developing both green and mature reservoirs (Mohaghegh et al., 2012; Amar et al., 2018; Amar and Zeraibi, 2020). However, with a high number of wells and in the presence of various kinds of uncertainties, such as the geological data, the degree of complexity in the task of identifying suitable BHP values increases significantly. Therefore, an oriented workflow was considered in this study for optimizing the BHP values of the producer and injector wells.\nWF is a rigorous technique for improving oil recovery, which demands relatively low costs to implement, but can significantly improve and extend oil displacement efficiency. However, the above-mentioned benefits of WF are dependent on an adequate design and wise choice of its main control parameters. There are several recent contributions that proposed relevant workflows for optimizing the control parameters of WF by combining some numerical, statistical, and optimization approaches. Among them is\u00a0Mohaghegh (2011), who establishes an artificial intelligence based proxy for investigating suitable wells for relaxing their rates in a WF case after performing an initial number of simulations using a commercial software.\u00a0Alenezi and Mohaghegh (2017) developed a smart proxy model for mimicking the outputs of a commercial simulator during WF optimization of the SACROC case based on series of artificial neural networks (ANN).\u00a0Artun (2017) demonstrated the higher performance of ANN compared with Capacitance Resistance Model (CRM) for modeling interwell connectivity in WF cases.\u00a0Hourfar et al. (2019) introduced an reinforcement learning approach to optimize a WF project. Their workflow was applied on the Egg-model.\u00a0Ng et al. (2021) proposed a hybrid model combining an ANN and two nature-inspired algorithms, particle swarm optimization and grey wolf optimization, for optimizing the control parameters of producer and injector wells during the WF phase.\u00a0Xue et al. (2022) propose a divide-and-conquer optimization paradigm to decompose a large scale WF production optimization problem into a number of simpler data-driven surrogates.\u00a0Wang et al. (2022) propose a novel self-adaptive multi-fidelity surrogate-assisted multi-objective production optimization algorithm to reduce the computational burden and enhance the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nThe BHP values of the wells are chosen with the objective to maximize the net present value (NPV) and ensure safe and efficient delivery of hydrocarbons from the well to the collection facilities\u00a0(Leporini et al., 2019). Possible problems related to flow assurance occurring during the transportation (such as liquid loading, wax deposition, sand deposition, etc.)\u00a0(Dall\u2019Acqua et al., 2017) or across particular equipment (such as multiphase valves)\u00a0(Giacchetta et al., 2014) are addressed.

The simulation runs were performed using the commercial simulator Eclipse. In order to reduce the computational time of the realizations, a Matlab code was written for running the cases in Eclipse and extracting their results automatically. Notably, the simulation runs and the calculations were done using an Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Gold 6248 2.50\u00a0GHz and 64 Gb of RAM, and an Intel\u00ae CoreTM i7-7700HQ 2.80\u00a0GHz and 16 Gb of RAM. The main steps of the workflow applied for each realization of the reservoir model are summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 1: Generate a predefined number of runs. In this step, the Latin Hypercube Design was applied for generating the BHP values of \u201cn\u201d runs for each realization of the reservoir uncertainty. This step aimed at ensuring a good distribution of the runs around the search space and it allows the identification of the regions susceptible to involve high NPV values. Based on the length of the BHP intervals and the computational time of each realization, it was judged suitable to assume n=60 runs.\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 2: Simulate the cases using Eclipse and the written Matlab code.\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 3: Sort the runs with respect to their calculated NPV values.\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 4: Select the best 5 runs having the highest NPV among the 60 runs.\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 5: Apply a grid search technique on the selected 5 runs by dividing the neighbor regions of the decision variables of these runs into sub-intervals and simulate the new cases using Eclipse and the written Matlab code.\n\n\n\u2022\nStep 6: Find the best run with the highest NPV value.\n\n\n\nThe optimization yields oil production, water production and water injection rates that maximize the NPV in each realization. We present the results of the production optimization in Section\u00a04.1. Our primary focus is on the comparison between the project values resulting from parallel and sequential development strategies that are based on the same production profiles. Therefore, issues that do not add much difference between the two strategies, such as well placement optimization, are not considered in this study. However, the well control optimization problem presented in the paper can be extended by considering the optimal well placement. If the well placement is considered as a decision variable in addition to the procedure that we discuss, the number of runs needed to achieve the optimal NPV within the presented well control optimization has to be increased. We refer to several contributions including\u00a0Silva et al. (2020),\u00a0Sayyafzadeh and Alrashdi (2020) and\u00a0Kristoffersen et al. (2021) that perform well placement optimization based on the Olympus case.\n\n\n3.2\nOil price modeling\nWe consider that the future oil price evolves over the project time as a two-factor stochastic process as proposed by\u00a0Schwartz and Smith (2000). Earlier contributions including\u00a0Jafarizadeh et al. (2012) and\u00a0Fedorov et al. (2021), demonstrated that this price model presents a good balance between the ability to replicate the range of uncertainty in future oil prices and ease of calibration process. However, different price models such as geometric Brownian motion (GBM) or mean-reversion process can be used to reflect uncertainty in future oil prices. We refer to\u00a0Al-Harthy (2007),\u00a0Xu et al. (2012) and\u00a0Fedorov et al. (2021) who perform a comparison between the above-mentioned price models in petroleum projects valuation.\nThe\u00a0[44]\u2019s model assumes that the commodity price is driven by two stochastic factors: the long-term factor \n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nt\n\n\n, which follows a Brownian motion as given by \n\n(2)\n\n\nd\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nd\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nd\n\n\nz\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n denotes the drift rate and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n is the volatility; and the short-term factor \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nt\n\n\n, which is modeled as a mean reverting Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process as given by \n\n(3)\n\n\nd\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\u03ba\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nd\n\n\nz\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u03ba\n is the mean-reversion coefficient and \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n denotes the volatility.\nAs we simulate the development of project cash flows in discrete time with time steps of one year and apply the risk-neutral valuation technique, we discretize the risk-neutral versions of both price process components as given by \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nt\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nt\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nt\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nt\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03ba\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03ba\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\n\ne\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\u03ba\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\u03ba\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n in Eqs.\u00a0(4) and (5) are standard normal random variables and are correlated in each time period with the correlation coefficient \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\u03be\n\u03c7\n\n\n.\nWe use the Kalman filter to calibrate the parameters of\u00a0[44]\u2019s price process. We estimate seven coefficients used in Eqs.\u00a0(4) and (5) based on historical spot and futures prices by maximizing the log-likelihood score. Further details regarding the calibration process using the Kalman filter are discussed by\u00a0Thomas and Bratvold (2015) and\u00a0Fedorov et al. (2021). The results of the calibration are presented in Section\u00a04.2.\n\n\n3.3\nCost uncertainty modeling\nThe yearly operating costs \n\nO\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n of both licenses are assumed to consist of a fixed (\n\nF\nO\n\n) and several variable parameters that depend on the yearly production rate of the field \n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, the average annual oil price \n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, water injection \n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nw\ni\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n and water production \n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nw\np\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n rates: \n\n(6)\n\n\nO\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n=\nF\nO\n+\na\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n+\nb\n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n+\nc\n\n\nq\n\n\nw\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\nd\n\n\nq\n\n\nw\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \na\n, \nb\n, \nc\n and \nd\n are the coefficients determining the contribution of each parameter to the total cost.\nIn this study, we also consider capital expenditure (CAPEX) uncertainty. The amount of CAPEX in our case is mainly dictated by the cost of construction and installation of the production facilities, drilling costs and other associated costs. One of the main factors affecting the switching decision between Fields A and B is the compound CAPEX to switch that consists of the abandonment cost of Field A, modernization of the production unit and the drilling of wells in Field B.\nFollowing the approach in\u00a0Cardenas et al. (2018), we model each year\u2019s individual CAPEX as GBM processes with an identical drift rate \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n and volatility \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n, described by the differential equation: \n\n(7)\n\n\nd\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\n\n\nz\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n\n\n denotes the CAPEX in year \nt\n and \n\nd\n\n\nz\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n represents the Brownian increment. The discretized version of Eq.\u00a0(7) can be written as \n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n+\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\n[\n\n(\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2212\n0\n.\n5\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\u0394\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\u00e3o et al. (2005) and\u00a0Smith (2005) argue that in order to include cost uncertainty into the risk-neutral valuation procedure in a correct (from the methodological point of view) way, it can be modeled using subjective knowledge, but must be directly correlated with market uncertainty (i.e.\u00a0the oil price in our case). In the context of how the risks must be treated in the valuation procedure, the cost uncertainty falls somewhere between the notion of private and market risks. Correlating the cost uncertainty with the market parameters allows bias to be avoided where the valuation based on simulation paths with high oil prices and low CAPEX can lead to overestimation of the real option value.\n\nWilligers (2009) provides evidence of a strong correlation between oil prices and oil rig rental rates. His results indicated that the correlation coefficient between these two parameters in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico was 0.87 with one year\u2019s delay. Using this argument, we consider that all capital expenditure in time step \nt\n are correlated with the long-term component of the oil price in time step \n\nt\n\u2212\n1\n\n.\nWe correlate the normal random variables of the oil price and CAPEX stochastic processes as described by\u00a0Wiersema (2008) and applied by\u00a0Cardenas et al. (2018) in the following way: \n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u025b\n\n\n\n\n\u03be\n\n\nt\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u03be\n\n\n+\n\u025b\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u03be\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach that we take by correlating the CAPEX process and oil price process allows us to follow the recommendations of\u00a0Smith (2005) regarding treatment of different types of risks within a single risk-neutral valuation procedure. In Section\u00a05.3, we provide sensitivity analysis on the correlation factor, proving that disregarding the correlation between the CAPEX to switch and the oil price, can lead to biased valuation results.\n\n\n3.4\nProject valuation and real options approach\nIn order to estimate the investment value, we use simulated project cash flows that result from combining the production profiles of Fields A and B, oil price and cost trajectories (as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04). We first estimate the project value under the parallel development by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Then, we apply two alternative approaches to evaluate the sequential development, a \u201cmyopic\u201d approach and an \u201coptions\u201d approach. In case of the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, we use a simple Monte Carlo simulation method to generate realizations of the cash flow in Field A. The decision rule for abandonment of Field A is based on cash flow and production levels that indicate the depletion of Field A. Once Field A is abandoned in year \n\n\nt\n\n\nm\n\n\n, the facility is moved to develop Field B, whose cash flow is modeled in the same manner as in Field A. We assume that it takes \nk\n years between Field A being abandoned and Field B starting production. Therewith, we disregard the flexibility to wait to invest in Field B after the Field A was abandoned. Considering this flexibility would require valuation of a compound option including both the option to abandon\/switch and the option to wait for Field B investment. This is expected to further increase the additional value captured by the \u201coptions\u201d approach.\nIn order to account for the switching flexibility in case of the \u201coptions\u201d approach, we apply a real options analysis. We identify the optimal time to switch between two fields accounting for the fact that in order to make a decision to initiate switching in year \n\n\nt\n\n\no\n\n\n, the oil company can use information resolved by the end of year \n\n\n\nt\n\n\no\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n. If the decision to switch is made, production of Field A is ceased at time step \n\n\nt\n\n\no\n\n\n and facilities are moved to Field B, which starts production in year \n\n\n\nt\n\n\no\n\n\n+\nk\n\n. In order to allow for a fair comparison between the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach and the \u201coptions\u201d approach, we use the same simulated cash flow paths. The key difference between the two valuation approaches is the time when Field A is abandoned (\n\n\nt\n\n\nm\n\n\n and \n\n\nt\n\n\no\n\n\n) and the opportunity to leave Field B undeveloped in case of the \u201coptions\u201d approach. In some simulation cases, however, \n\n\nt\n\n\nm\n\n\n and \n\n\nt\n\n\no\n\n\n can be the same. By exploiting the flexibility to leave Field B undeveloped, the oil company can additionally hedge against the downside risk if the information regarding the oil price, expected recoverable reserves of Field B and CAPEX to switch indicates that investing in Field B is sub-optimal. In this case, production facilities that were used for the development of Field A can be sold or used for a different license.\nFor the \u201coptions\u201d approach, we use the LSM method introduced by\u00a0Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) to identify the optimal time to switch and whether Field B should be developed in each simulation case. The LSM has been applied in several recent contributions studying investment cases in oil and gas under uncertainty (see for example\u00a0Willigers and Bratvold (2010),\u00a0Fleten et al. (2011),\u00a0Jafarizadeh et al. (2012),\u00a0Thomas and Bratvold (2015),\u00a0Jafarizadeh and Bratvold (2015) and\u00a0Hong et al. (2019)). The main advantage of using the LSM in our case is its ability to handle multiple sources of uncertainties in problems with downstream decisions in a computationally effective manner.\nIn order to optimize the switching decision, the LSM algorithm works in a backward fashion starting from the last decision point when switching is possible. In the last decision point, the option to switch is exercised if the expected value of the immediate exercise, denoted by \n\n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n,\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n,\nC\nA\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n, is larger than zero. In every time step \nt\n between the last and the first decision point when the switching is possible, the LSM algorithm compares the expected value of the immediate exercise of the option to switch, and the continuation value, associated with the decision to continue production of Field A at least until the next decision point, expressed as \n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n,\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nq\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n,\nO\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n. \n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n is conditional on the oil price level \n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, expected recoverable reserves of Field B \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n and CAPEX to switch \n\nC\nA\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n, while \n\n\n\u03a6\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n is conditional on the oil price \n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, the then-current oil production rate of Field A \n\n\nq\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, the level of operational expenses of Field A \n\nO\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n, the expected recoverable reserves of Field B if the switching is delayed by one year \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\nt\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n and the expected CAPEX to switch if the switching is delayed by one year \n\nC\nA\nP\nE\n\n\nX\n\n\nt\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n.

We assume that the field operator has perfect information on both parameters when the decision to switch is being made. While for the capital expenditure this assumption is fully realistic, as oil companies can conclude contracts with suppliers in advance, leaving little room for deviations in the final cost, the assumption regarding the accurate knowledge of how much oil can be produced by Field B before drilling production wells is considered to be strong, but allows us to significantly simplify the optimization algorithm, which accounts for five uncertain factors, and makes the valuation procedure more transparent.

The oil company is then considered to abandon Field A at \n\n\nt\n\n\ns\n\n\nw\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n and sell the production unit that still has a substantial residual value.\nThe main requirement for implementing the LSM approach for such an optimization, is having a large enough set of realizations of each factor included in the regression function. A potential bottleneck is the number of needed production profile paths. In our case, 50 realizations of the reservoir uncertainty enabled performing the regression analysis. However, if the decision maker has, for example, only three production profile paths, this might result in invalidity of the regression analysis.\u00a0Fedorov et al. (2020) reach model validity by considering five realizations of the Olympus case.\n\n\n\n4\nCase study\n\n4.1\nField development case and production optimization\nThe considered reservoir model, Olympus case, is a synthetic reservoir that has been proposed as a benchmark model for studies aiming at establishing field development plans under geological uncertainties Fonseca et al. (2017),\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018) and\u00a0Chaturvedi (2021). The reservoir involves 16 wells (10 producers and 6 water-injectors) (see Fig.\u00a05) operating under BHP control mode. In this study, the producer wells are denoted by P1, P2, \u2026, P10, respectively, while the injector wells are designated as I1, I2, \u2026, I6, respectively. The area of the field is 9 km \u00d73 km and is bounded on one side by a fault. The average thickness of the reservoir is 50\u00a0m. The model consists of 341,728 grid cells (118\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0181\u00d716), among which 192,750 are active. The 3D dimensions of grids are approximately 50m\u00d750m\u00d73\u00a0m. The facies types of the reservoir include Channel Sand (in the upper zone), Shale (in the upper zone and barrier), and Coarse Sand, Medium Sand, and Fine Sand (in the lower zone). From the perspective of geological uncertainties, the Olympus reservoir includes 50 different model cases with different distributions of net-to-gross, porosity, and permeability. More details about the Olympus model can be found in\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018) and\u00a0Chaturvedi (2021).\n\nTable\u00a01 states the main parameters used for calculating the NPV that serves as an objective function for the production optimization workflow.\n3\n\n\n3\nAll parameters except the oil price are taken from the original publication of\u00a0Fonseca et al. (2018). The oil price is revised from 45 $\/bbl to 60 $\/bbl to reflect the price levels observed in the first half of 2021. The changes, however, do not affect the production optimization results.\n\n\n\nBefore proceeding to the optimization steps for each case of the ensemble, some preliminary runs were performed in order to set the maximum and minimum BHP values supported by the producers and injectors. Table\u00a02 reports the BHP intervals considered for the wells of the Olympus model in this study.\n\nThe comparison between the NPV results before (base case) and after (best case) the optimization for the different Olympus cases is reported in Fig.\u00a06. As can be seen, significant improvements were made in the NPV values for all cases after implementing the optimization approach.\n\n\nThe build-up phase is considered to take four years, after which Field A delivers its first oil in Year 5. The optimization yields the forecast for the oil production, water injection and water production rates for the first 20\u00a0years of the field lifetime. As the production phase lasts for more than 20\u00a0years in many simulation cases, we had to extrapolate the respective rates for an additional 10\u00a0years. As the production rate between 20 and 30\u00a0years in rather low, the extrapolation is not expected to provide significant discrepancies with the case if the production optimization was used for the whole period of 30\u00a0years. The resulting oil production, water injection and water production rates for three example cases (Olympus 18, 6 and 49), representing the \u201cworst\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d case of the reservoir performance, are illustrated in Fig.\u00a07. This figure demonstrates the range of uncertainty built in the Olympus reservoir case.\n\n\n4.2\nOil price simulation\nWe calibrate the oil price process parameters based on the historical market data by using the Kalman filter as demonstrated by\u00a0Fedorov et al. (2021). We use the Refinitiv Eikon\u00ae data on the ICE Brent historical futures contracts and Dated Brent spot prices from March 2006 to June 2021.\n\nThe resulting oil price process parameters are reported in Table\u00a03. Fig.\u00a08 illustrates examples of the simulated price paths and confidence bands based on 2,500 simulated cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nCosts\nDuring the build-up phase of Field A, the operator incurs capital costs in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4, which mainly consist of the facility cost and the cost of production drilling. Since we assume that Fields A and B are identical, the cost structure for the two fields for the parallel development case is the same. In case of the sequential production, in order to switch to Field B, the operator has to modernize the production unit in the first year after the production in Field A is shut down, i.e.\u00a0year \nt\n, and perform drilling in the second year \n\nt\n+\n1\n\n in order to switch to Field B. The production of Field B starts in year \n\nt\n+\n2\n\n, i.e.\u00a0the parameter \nk\n that we introduced in Section\u00a03.4 equals 2.\nAs mentioned in Section\u00a03.3, we model individual components of CAPEX as GBM processes correlated with the oil price. We split total CAPEX into several components that the field operator is expected to incur in each year (Y2, Y3, Y4 as well as the CAPEX in the first and second years after Field A is abandoned, \nt\n and \n\nt\n+\n1\n\n) that reflect different types of costs, which are independent from each other. We use identical parameters for the annual drift rate \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n of 2% and volatility \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n of 10% for GBM processes in Eq.\u00a0(8). However, each CAPEX process has its own initial value reflecting an existing estimate as of now for each component. Initial values for each component and description of types of cost components are reported in Table\u00a04. We take the same cost simulation paths for the valuation of the project under the parallel and sequential development.\nAdditionally, we must decide on the correlation level between the CAPEX and the oil price.\u00a0Willigers (2009), who studies the correlation between the rig rental rates in the North Sea and oil prices, found that the correlation coefficient equals 0.87. However, the field development case that we analyze also includes the cost of components (such as the production unit) and operations that are less dependent on the developments in the oil market than the rig rates studied by\u00a0Willigers (2009). Therefore, we decided to slightly downgrade the correlation coefficient used by\u00a0Willigers (2009) to 0.8. We also include a sensitivity analysis for the correlation factor in Section\u00a05.3.\n\n\nFig.\u00a09 illustrates example simulation paths for the oil price and CAPEX components, respectively. As can be seen, accounting for the correlation between the oil price and CAPEX allows us to avoid unrealistic simulation scenarios, where oil prices are low, whereas CAPEX is high. Therefore, we can decrease bias when analyzing the switching option.\n\nThe following parameters are used for Eq.\u00a0(6) to relate the annual OPEX (in million $) with the field production rate \n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, the oil price \n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, water injection \n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nw\ni\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n and water production \n\n\nq\n\n\n\n\nw\np\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n: \n\nF\nO\n\n\n\n=\n 66.3, \na\n\n\n=\n 0.36, \nb\n\n\n=\n 0.36, \nc\n\n\n=\n 1.2, \nd\n\n\n=\n 3.6.

Based on the discussion with our industry partner and our preliminary Monte Carlo simulation results, we concluded that it is more beneficial to decommission Field A earlier than at the moment when it starts generating negative cash flows under certain conditions. Firstly, the annual cash flow must be just slightly above zero in year \n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n. Secondly, the oil production rate must be rather low. Our results show that in most of the simulation cases, the cash flow from Field A is likely to fall below zero. Therefore, decommissioning Field A already in year \n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n+\n1\n\n avoids operating Field A under a negative cash flow for one year. Our results show that this approach allows an increase in expected project value under the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach compared to the case where a simple \u201cdecommission only if the cash is negative\u201d rule is used. Therefore, when we compare the \u201cmyopic\u201d and the \u201coptions\u201d approaches, the percentage difference between project values is more conservative.\nThe decision rules that we used to identify the optimal abandonment time of Field A under the parallel development and the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach are reported in Table\u00a05. Thereby, the abandonment is triggered, for example, if the annual cash flow generated by the field is below $20 million and the production rate is lower than 1.5 mmbbl\/year. If the cash flow is lower than $10 million, it is worth sacrificing an even higher production rate (below 2.5 mmbbl\/year) to decommission the field as soon as possible. The field is abandoned in every case where the cash flow falls below zero and the production rate is lower than 3.5 mmbbl\/year.\n\nThe salvage value that the production unit is sold for after Field A is abandoned is set to $200 million in those cases where Field B is left undeveloped. In cases where both fields are developed, however, the residual value of the production unit equals $100 million.\n\n\n4.5\nSwitching option\nGiven that the decision to switch is made at time step \nt\n, the production of Field B starts in year \n\nt\n+\n2\n\n. Fig.\u00a010 illustrates the project cash flow for an example simulation path where switching is initiated in Year 15.\n\n\nThe LSM algorithm starts evaluating the switching decision from the last year when Field A can produce oil, Year 34 in our case (taking into account information revealed by the end of that year). At that point of time, the operator has only two alternatives: to initiate switching to Field B in Year 35 or to leave Field B undeveloped. Therefore, Year 34 serves as the upper time limit for considering the switching option (see Fig.\u00a011). Due to the fact that the continuation value equals zero in Year 34, the option to switch is exercised in those simulated cases where the expected value of immediate exercise is above zero. Then, at each decision point between Year 33 and the first year when the decision to switch can be made (depends on the level of cash flow from Field A and the recovery factor in each simulated case), the algorithm defines the optimal course of action. It evaluates whether to continue production from Field A for at least one more year or to initiate switching to Field B already next year. Year 10 is assumed to be the lower time limit for considering the switching option for all simulated cases. We use a risk-free rate of 2.5% to discount cash flows.\nWe also consider the fact that the regulator\u2019s approval is needed to abandon Field A.\n4\n\n\n4\nFor example, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate requires that every petroleum project on the NCS contributes optimally to overall social benefit by extracting as much economical reserves as possible\u00a0(OG21, 2021).\n One consequence is that the field operator is obliged to reach a sufficient recovery factor to be able to decommission the field. In order to reflect this requirement in the modeling, only those simulation cases that generate annual cash flow below $70 million and deliver a production rate below 3.6 mmbbl per year are considered for a switching decision.\nIn some simulation cases the LSM optimization results in unreasonably late switching time between Fields A and B, letting Field A operate with a negative cash flow for several years before initiating the investment in Field B. This happens, for example, when the expected value of switching at a later time is higher than the immediate exercise value due to a high level of CAPEX to switch immediately. In this case, the algorithm captures the value of waiting to invest in Field B. If we had accounted for the possibility to abandon Field A first and then wait to invest in Field B, this value of waiting would have been addressed more accurately. However, in this paper, we explicitly disregard such analysis, accounting only for the option to switch with a fixed time between the abandonment of Field A and the production start-up for Field B. Therefore, we set another boundary condition, implying that the switching time suggested by the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach for each simulation case serves as the latest point to switch for the \u201coptions\u201d approach. It means that if the LSM optimization yields a switching time that is later than the one suggested by the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, we take the latter value as optimal. This avoids operating Field A under negative cash flow for more than one year. Therefore, the \u201coptions\u201d approach can only result in a switching time that is either equal to the one resulting from the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach or earlier. If the expected value of switching to Field B in year \n\n\nt\n\n\ns\n\n\nw\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n suggested by the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach has a negative value, the optimal decision for the \u201coptions\u201d approach is to leave Field B undeveloped. In fact, accounting for the option to wait to invest in Field B after Field A is abandoned can be considered as a potential extension for future research. The approach that we take in this paper can be regarded as relatively conservative as the additional flexibility to wait to invest in Field B is likely to add more value to the project.\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nProject valuation\nThe primary goal of our analysis is to analyze whether sequential production results in a higher expected project value compared to parallel development.\nBased on the procedure discussed in Section\u00a03, we first evaluate the value of developing two licenses in parallel, which requires a construction of two production units. The resulting expected value of parallel development is equal to $151 million.\nIn case of the sequential development, we use the \u201cmyopic\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d approaches for the valuation, respectively. As mentioned in Section\u00a03.4, the main difference between the \u201cmyopic\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d approaches is the switching time between Fields A and B and the opportunity to leave Field B undeveloped in the case of the \u201coptions\u201d approach. For the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, the decision to switch is made as soon as the cash flow from Field A approaches negative values. The valuation approach is based on a simple Monte Carlo simulation. For the \u201coptions\u201d approach, however, we need to know how to optimally operate the assets in order to be able to evaluate them correctly, i.e.\u00a0we need to identify the optimal time to abandon Field A and switch to Field B (or to leave it undeveloped) for each simulated case. The fact that the field operator can make optimal decisions over time is addressed within the \u201coptions\u201d approach. Fig.\u00a012 demonstrates how the abandonment time of Field A changes depending on which approach is used. Applying the real options analysis results in earlier abandonment of Field A in 56.9% of the total simulated cases. This makes the distribution of the optimal abandonment time for Field A under the \u201coptions\u201d approach shift to the left compared to the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach.\n\n\nWe should note that the LSM algorithm does not always capture the optimal course of action,\n5\n\n\n5\nThis problem is also discussed by\u00a0Jafarizadeh and Bratvold (2009) and\u00a0Hong et al. (2019).\n triggering the switching earlier or later than optimal\n6\n\n\n6\nOptimal switching time refers to the time that maximizes the true NPV that is unobservable for the decision maker when the decision to switch is made, but can be estimated using simulated cash flow paths.\n in some simulation cases. This is due to the fact that the regression function based on the current state of the decision variables is not a perfect estimate for the future cash flows. Therefore, in some simulated cases, following the policy suggested by the \u201coptions\u201d approach results in lower value than those of the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach. In our case, in 20.4% of the simulation cases the project value under the \u201coptions\u201d approach is lower compared to the value resulting from the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, while in 21.7% of cases the resulting values are equal as the switching time is the same. However, in 57.9% of the cases, the \u201coptions\u201d approach identifies a strategy that increases the overall project value compared to the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach. This strategy may be either to switch earlier or to leave Field B undeveloped.\nIn fact, our results showed that in 16.4% of the simulated cases the development of Field B has a negative NPV. Due to the fact that the license owner can learn about the uncertain factors included in the regression functions in Eqs.\u00a0(11) and (12) before making the switching decision, a significant part of the downside risk can be mitigated. Due to capturing those simulation cases where both the continuation and immediate exercise values are negative, the number of cases where the field operator invests in Field B that eventually would turn out to be unprofitable (based on true NPVs), decreases to 4.5%.\nThis leads to the fact that the expected project value under the \u201coptions\u201d approach is 11.9% larger compared to the value resulting from the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach. Table\u00a06 summarizes the results for the project valuation under the sequential production using these two approaches and the parallel development. The sequential production is clearly the optimal solution for the investment, resulting in the highest expected value. If the option to leave Field B undeveloped is not accounted for in the \u201coptions\u201d approach, which means that the operator is considered to be obliged to invest in Field B irrespective of the information revealed and we only use the switching timing optimization, the resulting project value is only 6.5% larger compared to the value resulting from the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach.\n\n\n5.2\nValidation\nThe advantage of our approach is that it allows the modeling of the effect of several types of uncertainty on the decision to switch. It allows us to capture the value of learning about the uncertain factors within the valuation procedure. However, the fact that we included five uncertain factors in the regression analysis described in Section\u00a03.4 (Eqs.\u00a0(11) and (12)), makes it difficult to derive tractable option exercise boundaries, illustrating which state of the uncertain factors triggers the option exercise. Exercise boundaries in real options problems often serve as validation instruments, enabling the demonstration that the results are intuitive and, for example, the option exercise is triggered by a certain combination of the oil price, production level and\/or CAPEX.\nIn this section, we perform such a validation and demonstrate that the LSM algorithm addresses the decision maker\u2019s ability to use new information in order to optimize decisions over time and account for this within the investment valuation procedure. We identify conditions of uncertain parameters that result in the decision to switch immediately, continue developing Field A or to abandon Field A, or leave Field B undeveloped.\n\n\nFig.\u00a013 illustrates parameters of each simulated case in Year 14 where the switching option is still available. The decision whether to switch from Field A to Field B in Year 15 is made based on parameters observed at the end of Year 14. Cases where the optimal decision according to the LSM algorithm was to switch in Year 15 are illustrated in Fig.\u00a013 by blue dots, while the cases where the optimal course of action was to continue Field A production are illustrated by black dots. Red dots reflect those cases where the optimal decision is to abandon Field A in Year 15 and leave Field B undeveloped. The \nx\n-axis refers to the annual cash flow from Field A in Year 14, \ny\n-axis is the CAPEX to switch from Field A to Field B in Year 15 (sum of the CAPEX in Year 15 and Year 16), \nz\n-axis is the expected recoverable reserves of Field B if switching is initiated in Year 15. The annual cash flow from Field A reflects three parameters included in the regression in Eq.\u00a0(12) at the same time: the oil production rate from Field A, the oil price and the OPEX. The data in Fig.\u00a013 reflects the boundary condition that Field A cannot be decommissioned as long as it generates an annual cash flow exceeding $70 million. The switching decision is triggered not only when the expected reserves of Field B are high, but in the whole range of the \nz\n-axis. Fig.\u00a013 also shows an intuitive result that the decision maker is most likely to refrain from the investment in Field B if the information indicates that its recoverable reserves are low.\n\nSlicing Fig.\u00a013 into a two-dimensional chart, we can analyze how the relation between the cash flow from Field A indicated in the \nx\n-axis and CAPEX to switch indicated in the \ny\n-axis impact the decision to switch. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a014, the option to switch immediately is exercised only in those simulated cases where the CAPEX to switch is relatively low.\n7\n\n\n7\nThe fact that Field A\u2019s annual cash flow falls below $70 million is often caused by an oil price decline, which causes that the simulated CAPEX to switch also decrease due to the correlation with the oil price.\n Our results show that in those simulation cases where the LSM algorithm initiates the switching decision relatively early (before Year 15), it captures those cases in which CAPEX are rather low. Fig.\u00a015 illustrates the 95-th percentile of CAPEX of those simulated cases, in which the optimal decision is to switch to Field B immediately. It means that only 5% of simulated cases that were exercised have a higher CAPEX to switch in a specific year. Thus, if the simulated CAPEX to switch is above the threshold, it is unlikely that immediate switching is optimal. After Year 15 the factor of low CAPEX to initiate switching becomes less significant as Field A reaches a maximum recovery factor and has to be decommissioned in an increasing number of cases. In these conditions, the investment in Field B is triggered if the expected investment value is positive, no matter how high the CAPEX to switch is.\n\nOverall, this validates that the LSM algorithm captures the optimal course of action in a significant number of simulated cases. This is done due to the possibility to rely the knowledge that the decision maker has when considering the switching option with the future cash flows that are unobservable when the decision is made. However, the accuracy of the switching time optimization depends strongly on the \u201cquality\u201d of the information the decision maker can obtain regarding, for example, the recoverable reserves in Field B. In the following section we discuss how the accuracy of the LSM optimization can change if different assumptions about the information \u201cquality\u201d are used.\n\n\n5.3\nSensitivity analysis\nOur assumption that the field operator obtains perfect information regarding expected recoverable reserves of Field B before they can make the decision to switch enabled reaching high accuracy in the LSM algorithm. The regression function describes the future cash flow that is unavailable to the decision maker when the switching decision is being made, quite well. This captured the optimal course of action (based on true NPVs) in most of the simulation cases. However, the assumption about the perfect information can be considered rather strong as hydrocarbon reservoirs are exposed to high amount of uncertainty, especially small ones. Performing an extensive appraisal program in such reservoirs might be too costly.\nIn this section we test different assumptions regarding the decision maker\u2019s knowledge about the reservoir uncertainty for Field B. We compare the percentage of project value increase created by the \u201coptions\u201d approach compared to the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach when the \u201cquality\u201d of the information about the expected recoverable reserves of Field B is reduced from 1 (perfect information) to 0.1 \u2013 0.95. If there is perfect information about the reservoir parameters, \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n, which is used in the regression analysis in Eqs.\u00a0(11) and (12), is equal to the simulated sum of the future annual production rates from Field B. This provides the decision maker with the actual value of the production potential of Field B. We now assume that the \u201cquality\u201d of the reservoir information is reduced from 1 to 0.9. It means that the information regarding the recoverable reserves can deviate from the true value within a range of \uff0b\/\u221210%. The degree of deviation is determined by a random parameter \nk\n generated from a uniform distribution \n\nk\n\u223c\nU\n\n(\n0\n.\n9\n,\n1\n.\n1\n)\n\n\n. For each simulation case, the actual sum of the future annual production rates from Field B is multiplied by \nk\n. In this way we model that \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n is an imperfect estimate of the production potential of Field B. When the reservoir information \u201cquality\u201d is further decreased to 0.1, \n\nk\n\u223c\nU\n\n(\n0\n.\n1\n,\n1\n.\n9\n)\n\n\n, \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n can differ from the actual recoverable reserves within a range of \uff0b\/\u221290%, which reduces the accuracy of the LSM algorithm as the regression function describes future cash flows with much less precision. This can be analyzed through the difference between expected project values resulting from the \u201coptions\u201d approach and the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach. The expected project value under the \u201coptions\u201d approach when perfect information is used, is an upper boundary that provides a maximal difference between project values under the two approaches.\n\n\nFig.\u00a016 illustrates that the percentage difference between the respective values decreases from 11.9% in case of the perfect information to 5.8% when the information \u201cquality\u201d equals 0.1. If the possibility to leave Field B undeveloped is not accounted for, the respective value reduces from 5.7% to 2.1%. As already mentioned above, several existing contributions point out that the LSM approach becomes less reliable when factors included in the regression analysis are not able to describe the future cash flow. In our case, when the information \u201cquality\u201d from Field B is low (equals 0.1), the \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n parameter becomes statistically insignificant for the regression function. This results in the \u201coptions\u201d approach increasing the project value only in 44.3% of the simulated cases compared to the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach (vs 57.9% when the perfect information is used). In this situation, the parameter \n\n\nQ\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nt\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n can be excluded from the regression functions. This makes the LSM algorithm take into account only learning about the oil price, OPEX and CAPEX levels, which still improves the expected project value compared to the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach.\nAs already mentioned, the only contribution in the petroleum literature studying the effect of uncertain future CAPEX on optimal field development decisions and a real option value, points out that considering correlation between the CAPEX and the oil price is very important for the project valuation results\u00a0(Cardenas et al., 2018). Our results confirm this finding. Fig.\u00a017 illustrates the percentage difference between the expected project value under the \u201coptions\u201d and the \u201cmyopic\u201d approaches. In case the correlation between the CAPEX and the oil price is disregarded, the valuation can result in an overestimated option value. This results from the fact that simulation paths with high oil prices and low switching cost (as well as the opposite case) in particular time steps can be frequently found. This is not in line with the market reality, and is considered to be a bias that affects optimal option policy. As the correlation factor is increased, these biased estimations cease, leading to more realistic project value estimations. The chosen correlation factor of 0.8 allowed us to realistically address the value of the option to switch. Overall, we can conclude that accounting for the correlation between oil prices and the level of CAPEX to switch is of high importance for valuation of such investment problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThis paper analyzes the economic potential of a sequential production strategy using the same production facilities for two oil fields. This strategy is considered as a cost-efficient solution for the development of marginal fields that cannot be tied back to existing infrastructure. By investing sequentially, the operator can gather additional information regarding uncertain parameters: the expected production rates of both oil fields, the oil price, OPEX of the first field and CAPEX to switch. We perform the valuation of the sequential production using two approaches: the \u201cmyopic\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d. In the \u201cmyopic\u201d approach, the switching is initiated only when Field A is depleted fully (reaches a negative cash flow). The \u201coptions\u201d approach allows for early switching if it maximizes the overall value of the project due to opportunity to learn about uncertain factors and hedges the downside risk of developing Field B.\nWe use the Olympus benchmark case as an underlying reservoir model for both fields and apply an oriented workflow to address the full range of the technical uncertainty embedded in the Olympus case. We also model the oil price and CAPEX to switch as two correlated stochastic processes.\nFor the \u201coptions\u201d approach, we implement a real options valuation procedure. We consider the decision to switch between two licenses as an optimization problem that is solved by the LSM algorithm. The optimization yields the optimal timing to switch between two licenses for each simulation case.\nOur results suggest that sequential production and accounting for the option to switch earlier or leave the second field undeveloped can add substantial value that might affect the final investment decision. Our analysis also supports the findings by\u00a0Cardenas et al. (2018) regarding the importance of the correlation between capital expenditure and the oil price for valuation of the flexibility in petroleum projects where CAPEX is one of the decision variables. Overall, our findings allow to conclude that the sequential production is a viable strategy for development of marginal stand-alone fields and can be considered to be used in practice. Applying a real options analysis is then needed to quantify the economic effect of flexibility embedded in this strategy.\nFuture research may be aimed at: (1) analyzing the value of additional flexibility to delay investment in subsequent field(s) after the first field had been decommissioned by considering the compound option; (2) addressing the opportunity to invest in appraisal of future field(s) in a more robust manner by means of history matching and Bayesian updating; (3) solving the optimal development order problem that we omitted by assuming that the two oil fields are identical.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nSemyon Fedorov: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Data curation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

The Canadian Gas Potential Committee estimates that in-place CBM resources are equal to be about 500 trillion cubic feet (TCF), three-quarters of which is located in Alberta (Gentzis et al., 2008; Gentzis and Bolen, 2008). Much of the coal bearing strata is in the central and southern parts of Alberta. The deeper Mannville coals have the greatest concentrations of gas with volume estimated to be about 320 TCF .\nOf the 24,000 CBM wells drilled in the province of Alberta up to 2013 (Accumap, 2014), the majority of them are drilled in the Horseshoe Canyon (HSC) and Belly River (BR) Formations. These formations tend to have low gas content with low water volumes and are often referred to as \u201cdry CBM\u201d. \u201cWet CBM\u201d, on the other hand, for example found in the Mannville Group, requires dewatering of the coal seams and water disposal prior to production. The Mannville Formation is an attractive CBM play due to its high gas in place potential estimated to be \u223c4-10 BCF per section depending on the thickness of the coal seam and gas content (Beaton et al., 2006; Gentzis et al., 2008). However, given gas prices over the past decade, it remains unlikely significant expansion of CBM operations will occur.\nMost research work in the literature is focused on CBM reservoir simulation models to predict methane resource potential and production rate profiles. Young (1998) constructed a three-dimensional CBM reservoir simulation model consisting of vertical wells intercepting multiple coal seams. In this model, structural features such as reservoir dip and no-flow barriers (faults and shale breaks), and gas-water gravity segregation were considered. Other features that were modeled included stress-induced changes in cleat porosity and permeability and matrix shrinkage due to release of adsorbed gas. In their model, cleats were treated as connected pipes that divided matrix elements (slabs, cylinders or spheres) which in turn was the source of gas that diffuses by Fick's Law into the cleats. In their model, they did not capture the effect of relative permeability and capillary pressure, which governs multiphase fluid flow in the CBM reservoirs. They did not take into account multiple components and their respective phases in which they exists which play an important role in deciding producibility from coalbeds.\n\nGentzis et al. (2008) used a compositional reservoir simulator with horizontal wells to predict coalbed methane producibility (peak gas production rates, cumulative production, and recovery efficiencies) from the Gates coals. They also demonstrated positive impact of constructive interference of depressurizing coal reservoirs to accelerate gas production over relatively short periods of time. The geological model in their model was simple; they did not consider detailed description of the underlying geology of the coal seams and surrounding rock strata. These layers may contribute to gas transport and thus are important to be included in CBM reservoir models.\n\nKaracan and Olea (2015) constructed stochastic reservoir simulation models to estimate the uncertainty of coal seam degasification. Their work mainly focused on minimizing errors of predicting different coal properties to create a spatially distributed model of coal seam properties to analyse in-place gas and water saturations. The models were not tightly constrained to available geological data with respect to multiple facies.\nMost of the literature on in-situ coal bed geological and reservoir models has focussed on building simple simulation models of coal bed methane systems where details of the heterogeneity of the coal seams are missing. Given that flow and dynamics are linked to the heterogeneity of the coal seam and bounding formations, information on heterogeneity must be included.\nMannville Formation coal seams are interbedded between shale and siltstone layers which play an important role on connectivity, both pressure and hydraulic, between coal layers. This means that the overall fluid flow dynamics that exist within and between coal seams in the Mannville Formation are complex. The changes in pressure from one point to another point and entrapment of gases due to water which tends to occupy larger pore spaces create opportunities for viscous fingering due to permeability variations and associated flow and diffusion of low viscosity gas into water.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Mannville Group is among the oldest Cretaceous rocks within the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (Hayes et al., 1994). The Mannville spans the entire basin with thickness from less than 40\u00a0m in the plains to more than 700\u00a0m in the Rocky Mountain Foothills. In the Central Alberta Plains, the Mannville Group is subdivided into the Upper Mannville and Lower Mannville Groups (Beaton et al., 2006). The Upper Mannville group consists of the Upper Mannville and Glauconitic Sandstone whereas the Lower Mannville group contains Ostracod Beds and the Elerslie Formation. Thick, laterally extensive coal seams are found in the upper part of Mannville group (Beaton et al., 2006).\nHere, we focus on coal seams in the Upper Mannville Formation which are laterally discontinuous, interbedded with very fine shallow-marine sandstone and shale sequences. Stratigraphic complexities and lithological patterns are evident from examination of Mannville logs. The present day top surface structure of the Mannville reflects tectonic elements that controlled Mannville deposition. For the majority of the Mannville, it dips southwestward with dip angle steepening toward the Rocky Mountains. The stratigraphy of the Mannville Formation differs between central, southern, and eastern Alberta due to varying sea-level (Banerjee and Goodrazi, 1990a,b). Banerjee and Goodrazi (1990a,b) present generalized sequences of both central and southern areas revealing a transgressive unit at the base, a progradational shoreline sequence in the middle, and a coal-bearing sequence at top. They also describe that in the South there is a fining-upward aggradational fluvial sequence at the base whereas in central Alberta, there is a coarsening-upward transgressive sequence at the base.\n\n\n3\nCoal distribution\nThe lower cretaceous Mannville group contains significant coal deposits. In the Alberta Plains, two to four coal subzones occur within the Upper Mannville Group. Unlike the coals of the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary of Alberta, the Mannville coals generally occur at depth (>800\u00a0m) in the plains, only coming near surface in the north-eastern area of the province. Mannville Formation rocks (and net coal) thicken from east to west in west-central Alberta. The thickest Mannville Formation coals occur in the Red Deer area, with 6\u201312\u00a0m of net coal thickness. In the deep basin and westward toward the Foothills, net coal thickness can exceed 16\u00a0m; however, the net coal thickness is generally in the range of 2\u20136\u00a0m. Thinner, shallower Mannville Formation coals occur within the Firebag Coal Zone near Fort McMurray. These coals are laterally discontinuous, and the thickness is extremely variable. Net coal ranges from less than 1\u00a0m to greater than 11\u00a0m over short distances as described by Beaton et al. (2006). The occurrence of thick coal within the thermogenic-gas window has made Mannville (and equivalent) coal an attractive target for exploration (Beaton et al., 2006). The gas content of Mannville coals in the central Plains are in the range of 8\u201310\u00a0cm3\/g at depths from 1000 to 1400\u00a0m.\n\n3.1\nCoal rank and maceral composition\nThe Mannville coals are humic coals, finely banded at macroscopic level, formed from rooted vegetation that was deposited in mires and accumulated as peat (Gentzis et al., 2008). These coals have high thermal maturity and therefore had high heat flow during burial which also explains the reason for high gas content in these coals. The core analysis sample from Well 14-22-063-05 W5M suggests that calorific values (or heating values) on an equilibrium-moisture basis range from about 19,000 to 29,500\u00a0kJ\/kg (8200 to 12,700 Btu\/lb), with the shaley coal being at the low end of the range. On a moist, mineral-matter free (mmmf) basis, calorific values are within the range from 29,700 to 30,700\u00a0kJ\/kg (12,800 to 13,200 Btu\/lb). According to ASTM standards, as presented in Fig. 1\n, the calorific value places the coal at a borderline high volatile bituminous B to C rank.\nTwo core samples from different depths of Well 14-22-063-05W5 reveal that the coal contains a moderate percentage of vitrinite (61%) and inert semifusinite (23%) along with fusinite, inertodetrinite and exinite, as displayed in Fig. 2\n. This maceral composition actually affects the porosity of the coal. Since the coal has high vitrinite percentage, it is indicative of more micropores present within the coal and low porosity (Clarkson and Bustin, 1996, 1999).\nThere is a variation of the gas content with depth in Mannville coal seams. It is observed that moving from east to west, the gas content increases with depth. The variation is not significant with gas content in the shallower area, i.e. from 860 to 970\u00a0m in the range of 180\u2013330 scf\/ton whereas it goes from 220 to 370 scf\/ton in the 1210 to 1280\u00a0m zone as shown in Fig. 3\n. The initial gas in place for the Doris field is estimated to be 188,792\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 scf (AER Alberta Energy Regulator, 2008). The carbonaceous shale also holds small quantities of gas which is of the order 10\u201340 scf\/ton. Gas storage capacity in coal depends on its ash content. It is evident from Fig. 4\n that reservoirs with low ash content will have higher gas storage capacity whereas high ash content reduces the capacity to store gas. In the Mannville, the coal seams have ash content <35% whereas carbonaceous shale have >85% ash content.\n\n\n3.2\nCleating\nCleat networks play an important role in contributing to the permeability of coal reservoirs (Rightmire, 1984). Cleat development and cleat density (spacing) are influenced by coal rank and type. Fig. 5\n shows core photos from four samples at different depths of Well 4-10-060-06W5M. In Sample A, it is evident that the Mannville coal consists of alternate black and grey bands representing vitrain and durain bands, respectively. The coals from the Mannville largely consist of 70% vitrain and 30% durain bands with moderate to well-developed face cleats as shown in Fig. 5. Vitrain bands are up to 0.5\u00a0cm thick with less than 10% ash, though cleats are poorly developed in the sample with 0.3\u20131\u00a0cm thickness. In Sample B, the sample has 80% vitrain and 20% durain bands with vitrain bands up to 0.3\u00a0cm thick with less than 10% ash with moderately developed cleats of 0.2\u20131.5\u00a0cm thickness. In Sample C, the medium dark grey shale with interlaminated coal has more than 60% ash content with poorly developed cleats except for well-developed micro cleating in the thin vitrain bands. In Sample D, there is 50% vitrain and 50% durain with 20\u201340% ash content. The sample has poorly developed cleats except for microcleating in occasional vitrain bands. Butt cleats are not well developed and have low density when compared to face cleats. It is evident from the core photos that the Mannville does not have a well-established butt cleat network and thus it requires hydraulic fracturing to enhance the permeability to enable gas production. It can be seen that cleat density is evident in the vitrain rich bands when compared to the shale and high durain bands. The maximum vitrinite reflectance from 3 samples for Well 14-22-063-05W5M, as shown in Fig. 6\n, is between 0.62 and 0.65%. Based on Fig. 7\n (Laubach et al., 1998), it can be estimated that face cleat spacing in the Doris Unit is of the order of 1\u20133\u00a0cm. Cleat density is highest in medium volatile bituminous to semianthracite rank coals (Gentzis et al., 2008). In the Alberta Basin, major (face) cleats have formed parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal stress, which is roughly in the SW-NE direction. Butt cleats, when developed, are at almost 90\u00b0 to the face cleats (Gentzis et al., 2008). Cleat spacing is also affected by ash content. However, the Mannville coals in the area studied have less than 20\u00a0wt percent ash content.\nThermogenic gas generation starts at about 0.5% vitrinite reflectance and reaches a transformation ratio value of 0.1\u00a0at \u223c0.7%. Since the Mannville coal samples typically have a maximum mean vitrinite reflectance between 0.62 and 0.65%, this suggests that the thermogenic gas contribution in Mannville coals is not very high. This implies mainly biogenic gas origin.\nAs presented in Fig. 8\n, most of the Mannville coals in central Alberta considered in this study are between 8000 and 10,000\u00a0kPa with reservoir temperature generally between 40 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n3.3\nGeochemical analysis and gas composition\nThe variation of sulphur content versus ash content for the coal intervals of Wells 02-30-063-05W5 and 14-22-063-05W5 is shown in Fig. 9\n. It is observed that in these Mannville wells that below about 25% ash content, the sulphur content hovers at about 0.45%. There is a weak trend that the lower the ash content, the higher is the sulphur content. Sulphur content is a measure of bacterial activity and oxidation-reduction potential of the system which can help to understand the paleoenvironment. The total sulphur of the Mannville coal is controlled by sulphate availability, the pH of the environment, availability of ferrous ion and lithology (Banerjee and Goodrazi, 1990a,b). The majority of sulphur in brackish coal originates from sulphate-reducing bacteria in seawater (Banerjee and Goodrazi, 1990a,b). The in-situ sulphur weight percent on a dry basis is less than 0.60% for Mannville Wells 02-30-063-05W5 and 14-22-063-05W5. The sulphate availability for most samples obtained is less than 12\u00a0mg\/l. Sulphate-reducing bacteria are most active in moderate pH (6.5\u20138) environments (Banerjee and Goodrazi, 1990a,b). Mannville water analysis results, presented in Table 1\n, have similar pH. Ferrous ion availability is controlled by transportation of clays containing adsorbed ferrous ions into the system. Its availability in the Mannville is highly variable with values from 0.1 to 79.2\u00a0mg\/l.\nThe Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) content in water, listed in Table 2\n, produced from the Mannville coals has an average value of 48,928\u00a0mg\/l, of which the majority is sodium ions (17,107\u00a0mg\/l on average) and chloride ions (29,037\u00a0mg\/l on average). The bicarbonates content on average stands at around 530\u00a0mg\/l whereas calcium, strontium, barium, and magnesium make up the remaining cations (see Table 3).\n\nFig. 10\n presents an adsorption isotherm for a coal sample from Well 03\/02-30-063-05W5. The fitted parameters for the adsorption isotherm are listed in Table 2. According to the coal bed analysis report for Well 02-30-063-05W5 (Accumap, 2014), sixteen samples were collected at depths from 946.35 to 960.60\u00a0m. The net thickness of coal sampled in Mannville is 95\u00a0m. Three coal seams were sampled: Seam 1 (946.35\u2013948.10\u00a0m) which contains net 1.10\u00a0m of coal and has a gas content of 192 scf\/ton in situ (270 scf\/ton dry ash free basis), Seam 2 (954.85\u2013955.50\u00a0m) which contains net 0.65\u00a0m of coal and has a gas content of 157 scf\/ton in situ (281 scf\/ton dry ash free basis), and Seam 3 (958.40\u2013960.60\u00a0m) which contains net 2.20\u00a0m of coal and has a gas content of 245 scf\/ton in situ (296 scf\/ton dry ash free basis). The gas analyzed from Well 03\/02-30-063-05W5\/0 is composed mainly of methane, ethane, propane, butane and carbon dioxide with molar composition methane 94%, ethane 2.8%, propane 0.5%, butane 0.2% and carbon dioxide 2.5% (Accumap, 2014). Hydrogen sulphide in the produced gas is negligible. The average composition measured 97.09% (C1\u2013C4+) in the Mannville coals. The total in-situ gas (C1\u2013C4+) of the three seams is equal to about 162 BCF\/mi2.\n\n\n\n4\nFacies modelling\nThe Mannville Formation has beds of coal which are interbedded between sandstone and shale layers. They have a very complex lithological structure with more than 120 different types of facies described in core analysis data due to varying mineralogy (Kalkreuth, 2004). We have collected 5 different logs \u2013 Gamma ray (GR), Bulk Density (RHOB), Deep Resistivity (ILD), Neutron Porosity (NPSS), and Density Porosity (DPSS) \u2013 to build our petrophysical model. To build the geomodel, four major steps are completed: reservoir surface generation, petrophysical modelling, reservoir layer generation, and reservoir properties distribution. The Doris Mannville CBM gas field has 25 different pools in both Upper Mannville (A to H) and Lower Mannville (A to R) which are producing gas. The highest producing gas zone in Doris is Lower Mannville D with 206 E3m3\/d whereas in the Upper Mannville, Pool G is highest producer with 15.7 E3m3\/d.\nFrom analysis of logs and core data, to simplify the resulting reservoir simulation model, we have broadly classified the Mannville into four major facies: sandstone, siltstone, shale, and coal as illustrated in Fig. 11\n. We used a combination of Gamma Ray (GR) and Bulk Density (RHOB) logs and core analysis data to model facies in our area. These values are distributed between wells in our model by combining Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) with spherical variograms. Core analysis data and bulk density values were selected to build a value interval for each lithological description which was then correlated to RHOB log values for selected wells. Corresponding to each value, GR log values for each lithology is picked along with their measured depth (MD). Thus, we have developed a GR signature for each lithology. These signatures are then used to model facies in our area.\n\n4.1\nFacies A: sandstone\nSandstone in Mannville consists mainly of siderite, pyrite, carbonate, laminate, shaly coal, quartz, clay, and calcite. Sandstone layers in the Mannville are built using GR values analyzed from different wells. Based on our analysis, for our model we decided on 60\u00a0<\u00a0GR\u00a0\u2264\u00a077 gAPI corresponds to sandstone.\n\n\n4.2\nFacies B: siltstone\nSiltstone has various minerals such as laminated pyrite, carbonate, silty calcite, siderite, carbonate, dolomite, laminate, and quartz. It is finely grained sandstone present inside the Mannville formation and is built corresponding to the GR signature of 78\u00a0<\u00a0GR\u00a0\u2264\u00a0106 gAPI. These signatures are basically interpreted from those wells which have combination of core analysis, GR, and bulk density logs.\n\n\n4.3\nFacies C: shale\nShale in Mannville is sandy, argillaceous, and pyritic with laminated sandstone. The GR logs of Wells 03\/02-30-063-05W5\/0 and 00\/12-29-063-05W5\/0 are used to identify shale layers inside the Mannville formation. They have been correlated with GR\u00a0>\u00a0106 gAPI and then distributed in by using Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS). In the Mannville Formation shale layers are widespread and forms the largest percentage when compared to other facies present inside the reservoir. In most regions, the shale layers surrounded the coal layers and also account for some portion of the gas coming out of the zone.\n\n\n4.4\nFacies D: coal\nThe coal layers inside the Mannville Formation hold more than 99% of in-situ gas produced from the formation. The layers are picked by using a combination of GR (30\u00a0=\u00a0GR\u00a0\u2264\u00a060 gAPI) and RHOB (1.2\u2264RHOB\u22641.55\u00a0g\/cm3) logs from Wells 03\/02-30-063-05W5\/0 and 00\/12-29-063-05W5\/0.\n\n\n\n5\nGeological model\nTo build the geological model, 295 wells were analyzed, displayed in Fig. 12\n. The geological model is constructed as a subset of the data collection area referred here to as the Doris Field model. The geological and reservoir simulation model, referred here to as the Geological Model, shown as the smallest square in Fig. 12, is extracted of the Doris Field model since this reduces boundary effects on the model.\nFormation surfaces were generated by first identifying average Mannville Formation tops and bottoms in the data collection area. These formation depths were then imported into the geological modelling package, Petrel (Schlumberger, 2014). Next, coal seam tops and bottoms were identified in each well and were associated with surfaces. From the three-dimensional (3D) array of tops and bottom points, 3D surfaces were generated by using the Convergent Interpolation Technique (Schlumberger, 2014).\n\nFig. 13\n displays a visualization of the distribution of the facies in the Doris Field model constructed in Schlumberger's Petrel geological modelling package (Schlumberger, 2014). The Doris Field model area has dimensions 18\u00a0km by 13\u00a0km with height equal to 171\u00a0m. The total cell count in the Doris Model is equal to about 19 million cells. The view clearly shows that layers of coal are interbedded between shale, siltstone, and sandstone. This implies that excess gas generated in the coal seams will likely fill the porous siltstone and sandstone that bounds the coal seams.\n\nFig. 14\n displays a visualization of the Geological Model. Three wells, 03\/02-30-063-05W5, 00\/12-29-063-05W5\/0, and 00\/05-30-063-05W5\/2, sit within the Geological Model. In this submodel, the geological grid is refined: there are 413\u00a0cells in the east to west direction and 344\u00a0cells in the north to south direction \u2013 the dimension of the model domain are equal to roughly 2.06\u00a0km by 1.72\u00a0km. In the horizontal directions, each geological cell has dimensions equal to 5\u00a0m by 5\u00a0m. In the vertical direction there are 110 grid layers with thickness equal to 0.5\u00a0m or less, i.e. the thickness of the model is 55\u00a0m. The total cell count of the Geological Model is equal to 15, 627, 920.\nTo spatially distribute porosity values in the model from the log data, the descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode and standard deviation) for each rock type is computed from 247 data points obtained at different depth interval from the 35 wells listed in Table 4\n\n. A truncated normal distribution based on the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values is used to distribute the porosity values throughout the model.\nIn Fig. 15\n, the normally distributed input porosity data for the formation is displayed for all three rock types, i.e., sandstone, siltstone, and shale. For coal layers, we have used a combination of the neutron porosity (NPSS) logs and density porosity (DPSS) logs to distribute the porosity values. The most common relation used to model porosity in gas bearing formation is as follows: (1\/3)NPSS\u00a0+\u00a0(2\/3)DPSS. When this method was used to distribute the porosity, the values appeared to be very high for coal seam gas formation at 9500\u00a0kPa. According to our analysis, Mannville coals have porosity values less than 1% at in-situ conditions. Therefore, we have done analysis on the porosity distribution in our formation with other relations correlating NPSS and DPSS values and used the fourth correlation in Table 5\n which produced values consistent with other sources of data. Fig. 16\n displays the spatial distribution of the porosity derived from the fourth correlation.\nPermeability values are distributed in our models by generating porosity-permeability transforms for each rock type, displayed in Fig. 17\n. These transforms are built by using core analysis data from samples taken from 28 Mannville wells. The transforms are then inserted within the geological model. The mean value for permeability in Mannville coals is 0.44 mD whereas the maximum value of permeability is 6.54 mD; the permeability distribution is displayed in Fig. 18\n.\nIn the target area, the facies with relatively large porosity, i.e., sandstone and siltstone, is modeled as 100% saturated with water since no volume of oil and gas is reported in these two facies in the core analysis data. For shale, a truncated normal distribution with mean, median, mode and standard deviation equal to 0.5459, 0.155, 0.253 and 0.0745, respectively, is used to distribute water saturation values.\nIn the sandstone, siltstone, and shale, the water saturation has been taken to be equal to unity (there is no evidence of oil in the core data). In the coal facies, we have used Archie's equation to model water saturation. First, the formation factor for Mannville coal was calculated by using tortuosity factor (a\u00a0=\u00a01.5) and cementation exponent (m\u00a0=\u00a01.6) and porosity values are taken from the NPSS and DPSS logs. The resistivity of water is calculated by averaging water analysis data from 28 wells which is 0.129\u00a0\u03a9-m at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The resistivity of rocks is calculated from deep induction resistivity logs. In the coal seams, the maximum value for water saturation is 82.3%. The gas saturation in coal is the complement of the water saturation. The resulting spatial distribution of the water saturation is displayed in Fig. 19\n.\n\n\n6\nCoal layer heterogeneity\n\nFig. 20\n displays the arrangement of the coal seams in the Geological Model. The image of the realization reveal that the underground coal formations are highly heterogeneous with discrete and separate coal intervals. This alters the conventional view that coal bed layers are continuous and extensive \u2013 rather, they are \u2018wispy\u2019 with many holes and other discontinuities that yield a complex geometrical arrangement. The coal layers are interbedded between shale and siltstone layers which play an important role in connectivity, both pressure and hydraulic, between coal layers. This means that the overall fluid flow dynamics that exist within and between coal seams in the Mannville Formation will be complex. The variation in its properties creates simple yet complex visualization of simultaneous multiphase flow in the reservoirs. The spatial variation of the permeability, pressure, gases trapped because its saturation is lower than the critical gas saturation, and water larger pores existing in these facies may lead to instabilities of phase fronts leading to fingering due to flow and transport of low viscosity gas through water.\nFrom the analysis reported above, the coals in the Mannville Formation in the Geological Model area have porosity values of the order less than 1%; the porosity distribution in the coal seams is displayed in Fig. 21\n (top). Around 48% of the coal formation has values between 0.17 and 0.22%. They are deep unmineable coal which is under high in situ stress and therefore they exhibit very low permeability values with the mean of about 0.06 mD. The spatial distribution of the horizontal permeability is displayed in Fig. 21 (bottom). Fig. 22\n displays histograms of the porosity and horizontal permeability distributions within the coal seams of the Geological Model. Both distributions follow a lognormal distribution. The horizontal permeabilities are low suggesting that stimulation, for example hydraulic fracturing, is required to produce meaningful amounts of gas from these coal gas reservoirs. Fig. 23\n shows the spatial distribution of water saturation in the coal seams. The image reveals that the water saturation in the coal seams is largely between 0.2 and 0.3.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nAn analysis and processing of logs, core data, and spatial modelling has been used to construct a detailed and complex coal bed geological model. The heterogeneity of the coal seams in the Mannville Formation is clear with discontinuous \u2018lenses\u2019 of coal within the formation. These lenses are areally disconnected with perforated intervals where shale, siltstone, and sandstone sit within the coal volume. The implications of the spatial arrangement of the coal seams is that a vertical well will have limited contact with the coal seam and as a consequence will not effectively contact a large portion of the coal seam. On the other hand, horizontal wells that \u2018stitch\u2019 through the coal seams will be effective. This is especially the case when the horizontal wells intersect the coal seams as well as surrounding porous and permeable rock where gas likely accumulates beyond the coal seams. The arrangement of the coal seams suggests that more complex well arrangements may be needed such as multilateral wells. Given the low permeability of the coal seams, hydraulic fracturing is required to enhance the permeability of the coal to enable commercial production of gas.\n\n","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nLost circulation has been a known drilling problem for decades (Onyia, 1994). This problem becomes steadily more common and more expensive as the drilling depth increases and the mud weight window becomes narrow, e.g. in deepwater drilling and infill drilling (Lavrov, 2016). Theoretical studies of mud losses are often based on numerical modelling of drilling fluid invasion in natural fractures (Lavrov, 2005). In such models, the drilling fluid is represented as a generalized Newtonian fluid with a yield stress. Typically, Bingham or Herschel-Bulkley rheology is assumed for drilling fluids (Caenn et al., 2011; Majidi et al., 2008, 2010a; Rodr\u00edguez de Castro and Radilla, 2017). The validity of Herschel-Bulkley rheology for drilling fluids was recently reviewed in (Cayeux, 2020). It was found that the results of rheometric measurements on drilling fluid samples can be fitted with the Herschel-Bulkley model at low shear rates. A better fit to the experimental data in the entire range of shear rates can, according to (Cayeux, 2020), be obtained by using the Robertson-Stiff rheological model (Robertson and Stiff, 1976).\nIn a simple shear flow, the relationship between shear stress and strain rate in the Robertson-Stiff model is expressed by\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\nA\n\n\n(\n\n\n|\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n|\n\n+\nC\n\n)\n\nB\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the shear stress; \n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n\n is the shear rate; A, B, C are fitting parameters. From Eq. (1), the yield stress is equal to AC\n\nB\n. Thus, Eq. (1) can be re-written as follows:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n|\n\nC\n\n+\n1\n\n)\n\nB\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\n is the yield stress. When \n\n\u03c4\n<\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\n, the shear rate is zero, \n\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n=\n0\n\n.\nIn a general type of flow of a generalized Newtonian flow, the shear stress tensor, S, is related to the shear rate tensor, D, as follows (Irgens, 2008):\n\n(3)\n\n\nS\n=\n2\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n(\n\u0393\n)\n\nD\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u0393\n=\n\n\n2\nD\n:\nD\n\n\n\n is a shear rate measure; \u03bc\na\n is the apparent viscosity, for the Robertson-Stiff model given by:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\u0393\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u0393\nC\n\n+\n1\n\n)\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, the apparent viscosity for a Herschel-Bulkley fluid is given by:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n=\nK\n\n\u0393\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\u0393\n\n\n\n\nwhere K is consistency index; n is the flow index; \n\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\n is the yield stress. In a simple shear flow, the shear stress vs shear rate relationship for a Herschel-Bulkley fluid is given by:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\u03c4\n=\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n+\nK\n\n\n|\n\n\u03b3\n\u02d9\n\n|\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the Robertson-Stiff and Herschel-Bulkley models, the shear stress vs shear rate curves for both are shown in Fig. 1\n. The following rheological properties were used in Fig. 1: Herschel-Bulkley fluid: \u03c4\nY\n\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0Pa, n\u00a0=\u00a00.8, K\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u00a0Pa\u00a0s0.8; Robertson-Stiff fluid: \u03c4\nY\n\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0Pa, B\u00a0=\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a00.8, \n\nC\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\/\nK\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\/\nn\n\n\n=\n5623\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n. It is evident from Fig. 1 that, with the above choice of rheological properties, the Herschel-Bulkley model has a slightly larger apparent viscosity than the Robertson-Stiff fluid. This is as expected since, for 0\u00a0<\u00a0n\u00a0<\u00a01, \n\n\n\n(\n\n\n|\na\n|\n\n+\n\n|\nb\n|\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\/\nn\n\n\n\u2264\n\n\n|\na\n|\n\n\n1\n\/\nn\n\n\n+\n\n\n|\nb\n|\n\n\n1\n\/\nn\n\n\n\n.\nWhen computing fluid flow in a rock fracture, a relationship between the pressure gradient and the flow rate (or fluid velocity averaged across the fracture aperture) is used. Such a relationship is usually derived assuming that the lubrication theory approximation is valid (Zimmerman et al., 1991). In particular, the flow is Stokes flow (Re \u2192 0), and fracture faces are sufficiently smooth. Under these assumptions, the average fluid velocity of e.g. a Herschel-Bulkley fluid in a fracture of aperture w is given by (Morris et al., 2015):\n\n(7)\n\n\nv\n=\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n0\n\nif\n\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n<\n\n\n2\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nn\n\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n\n\nK\n\n1\n\/\nn\n\n\nw\n\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nn\n\n2\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\n1\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nw\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\n2\nn\n+\n1\n\n)\n\n\/\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\nw\n2\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nw\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n)\n\n\/\nn\n\n\n\n]\n\n\nif\n\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n>\n\n\n2\n\n\u03c4\nY\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u2207\nP\n\n is the pressure gradient in the plane of the fracture defined by Cartesian coordinates x\n1, x\n2. The third coordinate axis, x\n3, is directed normal to the fracture plane; x\n3\u00a0=\u00a00 defines the center plane between the fracture faces. It should be noted that v is understood as the velocity averaged across the fracture aperture, i.e. it is the flow rate divided by the fracture aperture, w.\nThe objectives of this study are (i) to derive a relationship between the average fluid velocity, v, and the pressure gradient, \n\n\u2207\nP\n\n, in fracture flow for the Robertson-Stiff model [similar to Eq. (7) for Herschel-Bulkley fluid], and (ii) to demonstrate practical use of this relationship in a 1D simulation of fluid flow and displacement from a borehole into a horizontal fracture.\nIt should be noted that an attempt to derive a relationship between the average fluid velocity and the pressure gradient in fracture flow for the Robertson-Stiff model was made already in the original paper by Robertson and Stiff. Unfortunately, a mistake was made in their derivation: The authors did not recognize the existence of the unyielded zone around the fracture's mid-plane. Consequently, the published results are incorrect (more exactly, they are correct only in the asymptotic case of \n\n\n|\n\n\u2207\nP\n\n|\n\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n).

The fluid properties are the same as those in Fig. 1. Since the Herschel-Bulkley fluid has a higher apparent viscosity than its Robertson-Stiff counterpart (Fig. 1), the dashed line in Fig. 2 runs lower than the solid line.\n\n\n3\nApplication example: one-dimensional radial flow and displacement in a horizontal fracture\nAs an example application of the Robertson-Stiff fluid flow in a fracture, we consider a radial, one-dimensional problem in which a yield-stress fluid displaces a Newtonian fluid. A horizontal infinite fracture is penetrated by a borehole, and a radial flow of drilling mud from the borehole into the fracture ensues.\nTheoretical models of mudlosses often assume that only one fluid is flowing in the fracture, namely the yield-stress fluid invading the fracture (Majidi et al., 2008, 2010a). This assumption might be valid when the formation fluid is a gas. The validity of this assumption in the case when the formation fluid is water or oil is less obvious. An example of a more realistic work where two fluids were properly considered is (Majidi et al., 2010b). Following the same path, we assume that, prior to drilling, the fracture was filled with a Newtonian fluid of viscosity \u03bc. This fluid is called \u201cfluid in place\u201d, or \u201cfluid 1\u201d below. The invading fluid is a yield-stress fluid described by the Robertson-Stiff model and is called \u201cinvading fluid\u201d or \u201cfluid 2\u201d. We assume laminar incompressible flow. We further assume that the overbalance pressure remains constant during the simulation since our goal here is simply to demonstrate the application of the model rather than to study a realistic operational scenario where the borehole pressure, P\n\nw\n, would be varying over time.\nThe fracture is circular in plane; the borehole meets the fracture in the center of the fracture. The external radius of the fracture is R\n\next\n (the \u201creservoir radius\u201d). Constant fluid pressure P\n0 is assumed at the external boundary; the initial formation pressure is equal to P\n0. The radius of the borehole is R\n\nw\n.\nMass balance equation for radial flow is given by\n\n(17)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\nr\n\n\n\n(\n\nr\nv\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\nwhere r is the radial coordinate; u is the (radial) average fluid velocity. Solution to Eq. (17) is given by\n\n(18)\n\n\nv\n=\n\n\nC\nv\n\nr\n\n\n\n\nwhere C\n\nv\n is an integration constant. In order to find C\n\nv\n, we assume that pressure is continuous across the interface between the invading fluid and the fluid in place, i.e. the interfacial tension pressure is equal to zero. Denote the radial position of the interface \n\n\nR\n\u02dc\n\n\n and the pressure at the interface \n\n\nP\n\u02dc\n\n\n. Then, at \n\nr\n>\n\nR\n\u02dc\n\n\n, the fracture is filled with the Newtonian formation fluid, and the averaged fluid velocity is given by the cubic law:\n\n(19)\n\n\nv\n=\n\n\nw\n2\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\u02dc\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n0\n\n\n\nr\n\nlog\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\ne\nx\nt\n\n\n\/\n\nR\n\u02dc\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nat\n\nr\n>\n\nR\n\u02dc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining Eqs.

Setting the initial interface position exactly at the borehole wall, i.e.\n\n\nR\n\u02dc\n\n=\n\nR\nw\n\n\n, would cause a numerical error since the interface must be located between two grid nodes in order to be identified.\nBoundary conditions are given by:\n\n(25)\n\n\nP\n=\n\nP\n0\n\n\nat\n\nr\n=\n\nR\n\ne\nx\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(26)\n\n\nP\n=\n\nP\nw\n\n\nat\n\nr\n=\n\nR\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above equations are solved numerically at each timestep as follows:\n\n1)\nThe velocity integration constant, C\n\nv\n, is found by solving Eqs.

It was shown earlier that predictor-corrector provides a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and computational cost in one-dimensional flows where a yield-stress fluid displaces a Newtonian fluid (Lavrov, 2021).\n\n\n\nLogarithmic grid is used, with progressive refinement towards the borehole wall.\nIt should be noted that our solution procedure is slightly different from the one used in (Majidi et al., 2010b). Namely, an infinite fracture was assumed in (Majidi et al., 2010b), with the solution for fluid 1 given by an integral. Fluid 1 was assumed compressible (Majidi et al., 2010b).\nAn example of the calculation is given in Fig. 3\n, alongside with a similar calculation for a Herschel-Bulkley fluid. The following input data were used: fracture aperture w\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mm; overbalance 1\u00a0kPa; R\n\next\n\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0m; R\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u00a0m. Viscosity of the formation fluid was \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.001\u00a0Pa\u00a0s (water). Properties of the invading fluid are given in the caption to Fig. 1. Since the Herschel-Bulkley fluid has a higher apparent viscosity than its Robertson-Stiff counterpart (Fig. 1), the dashed line in Fig. 3 is running below the solid line, i.e. the advancement of the interface is slower for the former.\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThe Robertson-Stiff model is one of the few non-Newtonian rheological models that admit analytical, closed-form solution for the flow rate as a function of the pressure gradient in fracture flow. Other such models are Herschel-Bulkley, power-law, and Bingham models. A closed-form solution speeds up computations where it is used as a closure law, e.g. in hydraulic fracturing simulations or in a mud loss model like the one used in Section 3. Using rheological models for which a closed-form solution is not available is still possible but entails extra compute time or requires approximating the rheological model, e.g. as was suggested in (Wrobel, 2020). The closed-form solution derived for the Robertson-Stiff model in this article makes a useful contribution to the bank of available non-Newtonian fluid models that can be employed in fracture flow simulations. One such application is provided by the demonstration example in Section 3.\nIt should be noted that the application example provided in Section 3 is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is not an advanced fluid loss model.

Sometimes this best model is accompanied by an ad-hoc P90 and P10 model to represent the uncertainty in light of the two extreme cases. We can now do better by introducing ensemble methods, which use model ensembles to represent the uncertainty. The ensemble methods allow for a consistent representation of uncertainty that propagates from the geological inputs to the simulated outputs. Furthermore, by using ensemble history-matching (HM) methods, such as the iterative ensemble smoothers, we can use the ensemble correlations between the geological inputs and the simulated outputs to compute regression updates of the geological description. The iterative ensemble smoothers can handle weak nonlinearities and have worked well in many reservoir field cases. An advantage of using an ensemble of models is that we avoid defining a \u201cbest\u201d model to base our decisions. Instead, we can make robust decisions based on the whole ensemble of model realizations. E.g., it is possible to compute which alternative control strategy results in the maximum net present value (NPV) when averaged over the ensemble of reservoir models. The existence of an ensemble of reservoir models and predictions also provides a basis for robust optimization of model controls that are the best in average over the whole ensemble.\nThe ensemble formulation facilitates a framework for integrated uncertainty analysis, history matching, optimization, and decision making. This paper demonstrates such a framework in a closed-loop formulation. We recursively update the reservoir model with new production data. Based on the updated models, we recompute the optimization of the control variables and re-evaluate the decision alternatives. This closed-loop ensemble framework is generally applicable to many prediction problems within and outside the geosciences.\n\nJansen et al. (2005) formulated the closed-loop reservoir management problem, later discussed by\u00a0Jansen et al. (2009) and\u00a0Skjervheim et al. (2015). The more prominent focus on developing methods for solving the history-matching problem may have delayed the development of closed-loop reservoir management systems. Additionally, closed-loop reservoir management adds another level of complexity as it involves both HM and optimization loops, which we need to solve iteratively, and the approach becomes less practical to apply and time consuming to run. history-matching is a prerequisite for a working reservoir optimization and further integration into the closed-loop framework. This paper differs from some other recent publications on optimization of drilling order and ensemble-based closed-loop reservoir management, e.g.,\u00a0Silva et al. (2017),\u00a0Lu and Reynolds (2020), Barros et al. (2020),\u00a0Leeuwenburgh et al. (2010, 2016). We also include a decision process in the workflow, and we point out some weaknesses of the EnOPT method when used with significant geological uncertainty.\nThe ensemble-history-matching formulation has evolved from early attempts of using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) developed by Evensen (1994, 2003, 2009) for recursive updating of reservoir models. The initial approach was similar to the recursive model updating in weather forecasting, except the focus was on the joint updating of the model parameters and the model state (N\u00e6vdal et al., 2003; Haugen et al., 2008). In weather prediction, one only updates the model state before making a new prediction of the future. A breakthrough paper by\u00a0Skjervheim et al. (2011) introduced the ensemble smoother from\u00a0Van Leeuwen and Evensen (1996) for parameter estimation, using the approach from\u00a0Evensen (2009, Chap.\u00a010). With further extensions of the initial smoother method to use iterations for reducing the impacts of nonlinearity\u00a0(Chen and Oliver, 2012, 2013; Emerick and Reynolds, 2012), iterative ensemble smoothers have become the method of choice in ensemble history matching. These methods simplify the history-matching problem by only updating the model parameters. Furthermore, they compute the solution by integrating the model from the initial time using the updated parameters, as in traditional history matching. In this paper, we have used the ensemble-subspace-EnRML method by\u00a0Evensen et al. (2019) and\u00a0Raanes et al. (2019).\n\nVan Essen et al. (2009) introduced the concept of robust optimization. He showed that optimizing controls over an ensemble of reservoir models gave superior results to optimization over a single model realization. A popular robust optimization method in the reservoir community is ensemble-based optimization (EnOPT)\u00a0(see, e.g., Lorentzen et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009). Characteristic of (EnOPT) is a statistical approximation to the objective function\u2019s gradient computed from ensemble statistics.\u00a0Stordal et al. (2016) and\u00a0Fonseca (2016) have further developed EnOPT to the version used in the current paper. Although we have used EnOPT in this paper, we will claim that the method still has issues handling problems with significant geological uncertainty as this leads to additional stochasticity in the gradient calculations. Recent alternative methods may be the learned-heuristics approach by\u00a0Wang and Oliver (2019) or the mean-model method introduced by\u00a0Wang and Oliver (2021), which both avoid using a gradient. These methods are promising for robust optimization, leading to reduced computational requirements and avoiding using an ensemble gradient.\nFinally, we should implement the decision alternative if its implementation leads to a positive NPV. The ensemble approach allows estimating the resulting NPV over the ensemble of updated reservoir models and provides a foundation for making a robust decision. The following sections will explain and demonstrate our closed-loop decision workflow on a simplified reservoir model. The workflow is readily applicable to realistic reservoir models and can include the geological modeling following the approach by\u00a0Zachariassen et al. (2011), Skjervheim et al. (2012), and\u00a0Hanea et al. (2015). Our example below focuses on optimizing the drilling order of pre-planned wells given a specific drilling schedule. Thus, we consider a discrete optimization problem.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nThis section introduces the closed-loop reservoir management workflow and briefly introduces the ensemble methods used. We define a model state \nx\n that characterizes the reservoir model and its uncertain geological variables. In our example, we assume uncertain porosity and permeability fields, and fault multipliers. These are reservoir parameters that are important for characterizing the volume of oil and its distribution in the reservoir. Additionally, the permeability together with the fault transmissibilities determine the connectivity and fluid flow in the reservoir. We will use history matching to improve our prior knowledge of \nx\n. The model controls \nu\n can be continuous variables such as imposed production and injection rates, but in our example, they represent the discrete drilling order of the wells. We assume a reservoir model \n\n(1)\n\n\ny\n=\ng\n\n(\nx\n,\nu\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nx\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n is the vector of \nn\n poorly known model parameters, \n\nu\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n is a vector of \n\n\nn\n\n\nc\n\n\n model controls, and \n\ny\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n is a set of \nm\n predicted measurements.\n\n2.1\nThe ensemble-based decision workflow\nThe closed-loop decision workflow in Fig.\u00a01 comprises various decision steps for reservoir management during the field development. The workflow is independent of the methods used for history matching and optimization, although it is ideally suited to ensemble methods. In other words, closed-loop reservoir management is the standard way of working. However, traditionally one has used less sophisticated manual methods for model updating and history matching. Furthermore, as an alternative to advanced optimization methods, one has used intuition, experience, and model simulations to decide the next reservoir-development steps and the drainage strategy.\nOur robust ensemble workflow uses ensemble history-matching and optimization methods recursively in time. We condition model parameters to all current and past observations to create the best possible ensemble of geologically consistent models that fits the measurements within their estimated uncertainty. We robustly optimize decision alternatives over the ensemble of history-matched geological models and evaluate each alternative\u2019s expected objective function at decision points.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nEnsemble-based optimization\nGiven a reservoir, where we use the variable \nx\n to represent the geological model state, and a set of control variables \nu\n defining its development and operation, we can define the objective function (e.g.,\u00a0evaluating the net present value) as \n\nO\n\n(\nu\n,\nx\n)\n\n\n. Thus, the objective function is a function of the control parameters and model state. The optimization goal is to find the controls in \nu\n that maximize the expected value of \nO\n\u00a0(Chang et al., 2019).\nWe will use EnOPT to maximize the objective function and start from the pre-conditioned steepest-ascent method \n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nuu\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\nu\n\n\n\nO\n\n(\n\n\nu\n\n\ni\n\n\n,\nx\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere the superscript \ni\n is the iteration index, \n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\ni\n\n\n is the step size, \n\n\nC\n\n\nuu\n\n\n is a pre-determined symmetric and positive definite matrix, and \n\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\nu\n\n\n\nO\n\n(\nu\n,\nx\n)\n\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\nN\n\u00d7\n1\n\n\n\n is the gradient of the objective function to the control variables evaluated at \n\n(\nu\n,\nx\n)\n\n.\nThe EnOPT algorithm\u00a0(Lorentzen et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009) introduces an approximate stochastic representation for the gradient. The method computes the gradient from an ensemble of controls, \n\n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n\u223c\nN\n\n(\nu\n,\n\n\nC\n\n\nuu\n\n\n)\n\n\n as a linear regression between the controls and the resulting NPVs. We use the subscript \nj\n as the ensemble realization index. From here and onwards, we only discuss the gradient approximation at the current iteration \ni\n. For the simplicity of notation, we, therefore, skip the iteration superscript on \n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\ni\n\n\n and note that \nx\n is independent of \ni\n. For a given geological model \nx\n, we can approximate the gradient as \n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\nu\n\n\n\nO\n\n(\nu\n,\nx\n)\n\n\u225c\n\n\nC\n\n\nuu\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nuo\n\n\n\u2248\n\n\nC\n\n\nuu\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nu\n\n\u00af\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\nO\n\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n,\nx\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\nO\n\n\u00af\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere \n\n\nu\n\n\u00af\n\n is the arithmetic average of the controls at iteration \ni\n, and \n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\u00af\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\nO\n\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n,\nx\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nis the arithmetic average of NPVs for all controls. Thus, we only need to compute the sample covariance, \n\n\nC\n\n\nuo\n\n\n, between the controls \n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n and the resulting ensemble of NPVs, \n\nO\n\n(\n\n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n,\nx\n\n)\n\n\n. The previous formulation defines the original EnOPT algorithm\u00a0(Lorentzen et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009).\n\nChen et al. (2009) also used EnOPT in the case with uncertain geology. They introduced uncertainty in the geological reservoir characterization and represented it by an ensemble of \nN\n model realizations. Formally, introducing an ensemble of reservoir models leads to an ensemble of simultaneous optimization problems, one for each geologic realization. We can then find one optimal control vector for each geologic realization. An alternative by\u00a0Van Essen et al. (2009) is to define an optimization problem where we sum the individual optimization problems and solve for one common optimal control vector.\nIt is common to associate only one realization \n\n\nu\n\n\nj\n\n\n to each geologic realizations \n\n\nx\n\n\nj\n\n\n as this simplifies the formulation and avoids running \n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\n simulations.\u00a0Stordal et al. (2016) showed that, for a sufficiently large ensemble size, this approximation does not introduce any bias in the gradient approximation.

(2016). Therefore, we will use the EnOPT method with Eq.\u00a0(7) in this work. In this version of EnOPT, we must also compute the NPV using \n\n\nu\n\n\u00af\n\n for all geological realizations in each iteration to evaluate the quality of the updated control and the stopping criteria. We have used a stopping criteria based on the improvement of objective function between two iterations. If the objective function fails to improve after three backtracking trial steps, the optimization algorithm stops. Thus, each optimization iteration requires \n\n2\nN\n\n simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3\nSubspace EnRML\nIn history matching, given measurements \nd\n of \ny\n, we estimate the posterior and conditional probability density function (PDF) of \nx\n from Bayes\u2019 formula written as \n\n(8)\n\n\nf\n\n(\nx\n\u2223\nd\n)\n\n\u221d\nf\n\n(\nx\n)\n\nf\n\n(\nd\n\u2223\ng\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\nHere \n\nf\n\n(\nx\n\u2223\nd\n)\n\n\n is the conditional PDF of the parameters \nx\n given the observations \nd\n. This posterior PDF is proportional to the product of the prior PDF \n\nf\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n and the likelihood \n\nf\n\n(\nd\n\u2223\ng\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n)\n\n\n. The prior PDF describes the prior knowledge of the parameters, while the likelihood describes the uncertainty in the observations. The proportionality constant is just one over the integral of the right-hand side of Eq.\u00a0(8). It ensures that the posterior PDF integrates to one, but for ensemble methods, it turns out that we do not need to compute it. For additional information on this formulation, see the discussion in\u00a0Evensen et al. (2022, Chap. 2). Note also that for the history-matching problem, we either treat the controls \nu\n as given, or if they are uncertain, we can include them in \nx\n as explained by\u00a0Evensen (2021). Note again that in the current paper, we do not optimize the controls but rather the drilling sequence, making it possible to add the controls to the HM state vector.\nIt is common to introduce the normally-distributed priors \n\n\n(9)\n\n\nf\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n=\nN\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\nf\n\n\n,\n\n\nC\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\nf\n\n(\nd\n\u2223\ng\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n)\n\n=\nf\n\n(\ne\n)\n\n=\nN\n\n(\n0\n,\n\n\nC\n\n\nd\nd\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n\nx\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n is the prior estimate of \nx\n with error-covariance matrix \n\n\n\nC\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n\n, and \n\n\n\nC\n\n\nd\nd\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\n\u211c\n\n\nm\n\u00d7\nm\n\n\n\n is the error-covariance matrix for the measurements.

(2019), Raanes et al. (2019), and they discuss its theoretical foundation as well as the practical implementation. Since, in the ensemble formulation, the solution is confined to an initially defined ensemble subspace, they showed that it is possible to formulate the EnRML method to search for the solution in the ensemble subspace. This formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and simpler algorithm where the number of unknowns is the number of ensemble members \nN\n rather than the number of parameters \nn\n. While \n\nN\n=\nO\n\n(\n100\n)\n\n\n, we often have \n\nn\n=\nO\n\n(\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n)\n\n\n. Theoretically, the ensemble subspace RML and the EnRML methods give identical results, but the subspace variant is more stable when \nn\n is large in practice.\n\nFig.\u00a02 illustrates the ensemble HM concept. The prior input parameters (blue bullets) lead to an ensemble prediction with considerable uncertainty that does not well represent the observations. Then, the iterative ensemble smoothers converge to a posterior set of parameter values (green bullets), resulting in an ensemble prediction better agreeing with the observations (black dots). For the details of the ensemble subspace RML algorithm and its implementation we refer to the two original papers by\u00a0Evensen et al. (2019) and Raanes et al. (2019), but see also the discussion in\u00a0Evensen (2021) and\u00a0Evensen et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nWorkflow and problem description\nThis section explains the closed-loop decision workflow illustrated in Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a01 applied to a reservoir model. We will use it to select the drilling schedule optimally. In the next section, we briefly introduce the reservoir model before demonstrating the decision workflow on a reservoir management case.\n\n3.1\nReservoir model\nWe use the REEK reservoir model provided by Equinor and described by\u00a0Hanea et al. (2017). The model simulates three fluid phases consisting of oil, water, and gas. The model grid has dimensions 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064\u00a0\u00d7\u00a014 and consists of 35840 grid cells. On average, the original oil in place (OOIP) is \n\n4\n\n831\n\u00d7\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n sm\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u00a0(Oguntola and Lorentzen, 2021). The reservoir has three zones (UpperReek, MidReek, and LowerReek) with six faults of different transmissibilities, and it has five producers and three injectors (see Fig.\u00a03). Thus, we use a relatively small but realistic model to demonstrate the ensemble workflows. The REEK model was also used in\u00a0Evensen et al. (2019), Evensen (2021) for testing iterative ensemble smoothers for reservoir history matching. We consider porosity, permeability and fault transmissibilities as uncertain model parameters. A model simulation requires one CPU minute on a single CPU.\n\n\n3.2\nProblem description\nWe have defined a demonstration case with eight preplanned wells, five producers, and three injectors. Given the constraint of drilling two wells a year, the goal is to determine the optimal drilling schedule for the preplanned wells as part of an annual maturation process. We represent the geological reservoir uncertainty for porosity, permeability and fault transmissibilities by using 100 geological realizations.

We use constant values for \nd\n and \n\u03c4\n in this case, where \n\nd\n=\n0\n.\n08\n,\n\u03c4\n=\n365\n\n.\nIn the NPV calculation in Eq.\u00a0(16) we have decided to ignore possible additional costs from carbon taxes. These taxes vary between countries, but we can easily add the additional costs from a carbon tax to the objective function. A carbon tax will reduce the profitability of each well, and it might change the decisions. As the energy companies now have increased emphasis on reducing CO\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n releases, almost regardless of the carbon taxation, it is becoming important to address multi-objective optimization where we maximize NPV while minimizing the CO\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n emissions. The current workflow will allow for such future applications.\nWe are using a twin experiment approach for the geology, but we do not know the optimal drilling strategy. We could have evaluated the optimal drilling strategy by a brute force simulation on the reference model, although with eight wells that would require 40320 simulations, which is more than we can afford with the current model and computer resources. Also, the purpose of this work is not to find the absolutely optimal drilling strategy but to demonstrate a consistent and affordable workflow that leads to a near-optimal drilling strategy within the uncertainty in the reservoir knowledge.\nInitially, the reservoir uncertainty is significant as we have limited information to determine the reservoir properties. Thus, when we compute the two initial wells to drill, we do this under considerable reservoir uncertainty. However, as soon as we start producing the reservoir, we will obtain dynamic data and use these in the history matching to improve the reservoir characterization. The subsequent optimization of the wells\u2019 drilling schedule will be more accurate due to the reduced reservoir uncertainty. In other words, we propose a workflow where we recursively introduce new optimal wells to drill next. We condition the model ensemble on the new dynamic data as soon as the wells provide new dynamic data. The reservoir model and the drilling order optimization will improve from one year to another. Additionally, the accuracy of the ensemble predictions will improve with each model update and lead to decision-making with reduced uncertainty.\nWe start by dividing the reservoir lifetime into different phases:\n\n\nInitialization:\n\nWe define the initial reservoir model and its uncertainty and represent it using the ensemble of model realizations (INIENS). We assigned uncertainty to the porosity, permeability, and fault multipliers (see the detailed specification below). We then use this model ensemble in ensemble predictions ENSPRED1\u00a0to define well targets and propose a drainage strategy for the reservoir.\n\nFirst year:\n\nWe must decide which wells to drill first (i.e.,\u00a0assuming two wells drilled in parallel). Although there are no observation data at the initial period, we can still robustly optimize on drilling sequence using the initial ensemble. After deciding on the two first wells from the optimization in OPT1, we assess their NPV over the ensemble in DEC1\u00a0before drilling them and producing the reservoir for the first year (PROD1). We acquire dynamic data from the first year during production and use these data to history match the model in HM1. From the history-matched model, we can run ensemble predictions ENSPRED1\u00a0to assess future production or even plan new well-targets to evaluate during the decision process for the following year.\n\nSecond year:\n\nWe repeat the procedure from year one for the second year. However, we start by using the now improved history-matched models with reduced geological uncertainty from the first year to make predictions and optimize for the two subsequent wells to drill in OPT2. After that, we evaluate if the two optimal wells give a positive NPV in DEC2, and if they are economical, we decide to drill them. Following the reservoir production, we condition the model on all the newly acquired data in HM2, and we are ready to plan new wells and optimize their drilling order for the third year.\n\nThird year:\n\nWe repeat the procedure from the second year to decide on the subsequent two wells.\n\nFourth year:\n\nIn the current example, there are only two wells left to decide on for the fourth year, so we do not need the optimization process; we can perform the decision-making DEC4\u00a0directly through ensemble scenario studies. However, we could have used reservoir ensemble from the third year to plan additional well-targets to select from in an optimization process OPT4.\n\n\n\nThe above division into an annual process is quite common in reservoir units. It is called an annual maturation process (AMAP) and follows a natural business process with yearly budgeting and economic predictions. The AMAP includes model updating, the planning of new wells and their evaluation, and the decision to drill or not to drill. Our ensemble workflow is a complete workflow supporting the AMAP and includes advanced history-matching and optimization tools in the process. And the workflow is robust, accounting for the total uncertainty.\nOur experiment follows the steps given in Table\u00a01. We start with an ensemble of 100 model realizations with different porosities, permeabilities, and fault multipliers.\nThe porosity fields have an average value equal to the average porosity from core data, and the variance should reflect the variability between the cores. We sampled the porosity fields from a distribution with mean equal to 0.18 and standard deviation of 0.1, restricted to the interval \n\n[\n0\n.\n00001\n,\n2\n.\n7\n]\n\n. For the logarithm of the permeability we sampled the random fields from a distribution with mean equal to 2.4 and standard deviation of 0.8, with permeability values restricted to the interval \n\n[\n0\n,\n2000\n]\n\n. For both porosity and permeability, we used an non-isotropic decorrelation scale of 1.0 km in the \nx\n-direction and 2.0 km in the \ny\n-direction. The vertical correlation between the sampled fields is 0.6, while the correlation between porosity and permeability is 0.75.\nIn addition to having uncertainty in the porosity and permeability, we assume the fault transmissibilities to be uncertain, and we sample them as log-uniform between zero and one.\nWe also define one model realization to represent the true reservoir geology. Given a drilling order, we simulate this model to obtain the \u201cobserved data\u201d on which we condition the ensemble. Thus, we use a twin-experiment approach.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nFollowing the workflow shown in Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a01, we will focus on the results of the optimization, history matching, and the final decision. To have a more straightforward comparison, we discuss the optimization steps OPT1, OPT2, and OPT3\u00a0together. After that, we will discuss the results from the history-matching steps HM1, HM2, and HM3, and finally we discuss the final decision DEC4. As the ensemble methods used for robust optimization are less mature than the ensemble history matching, we will discuss the drilling order optimization in more detail.\n\n4.1\nDrilling order optimization\nTo use EnOPT with discrete variables, we define an underlying continuous variable, drilling priority that varies between zero and one, to estimate. Then the well with the highest drilling priority is drilled first. Initially, we generate a sequence of drilling priorities between zero and one for all the wells, defining our starting drilling sequence. After that, we generate an ensemble of drilling priorities by adding random numbers drawn from a normal distribution \n\nN\n\n(\n0\n,\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n to generate perturbed drilling sequences. The variance parameter allows for tuning the magnitude of the perturbations in the ensemble of drilling priorities to ensure that the resulting drilling sequences differ from each other, but not too much. In our experiments we used \n\n\u03c3\n=\n0\n.\n1\n\n.\nTo determine which wells we should drill first, we optimized the drilling priorities over the reservoir lifetime. Given an ensemble of drilling priorities, the mean priorities define the current iteration\u2019s best drilling sequence. We then compute the NPV values over the geological ensemble from the production of the reservoir lifetime for all geological realizations. The average NPV is used to evaluate which drilling sequence is the best.\nWe could use EnOPT on a case without geological uncertainty, i.e.,\u00a0only one realization of the reservoir model. We would then have a gradient evaluated as the regression between the ensemble of predicted NPVs and the ensemble of controls. When adding a stochastic component to the reservoir model, we reduce the correlation between the control variables and the predicted NPV, and this causes problems for the EnOPT method. We can imagine cases where the geological uncertainty is so considerable that it completely masks any correlation between the NPVs and controls, and in this case, the method will fail. Thus, we restrict using EnOPT to cases of modest geological uncertainty. In the current example, we also expect the impact of uncertain geology to be the largest in the first iteration before we have started to condition the geological ensemble to dynamical measurements.\n\n\n\nWe have plotted the results from the three optimization steps OPT1, OPT2, and OPT3\u00a0in Fig.\u00a04 from the upper to the lower rows of plots. We show the mean NPV values versus the optimization iterations in the left column and the NPVs for the best run in the boxplots in the right column. In Table\u00a02 we list the starting and resulting drilling sequences for all the optimization experiments. We also note that we might run several trials in each iteration until we obtain a new sequence that leads to a higher NPV.\nFor the first optimization step, OPT1 shown in the upper row of Fig.\u00a04, we ran five optimization experiments using two different starting points. As the initial geological uncertainty is significant, performing several experiments searching for the best possible initial drilling sequence makes sense. The runs initialized with different random seeds for generating the control perturbations result in different optimization results, even when the geological ensemble is the same. In addition to solving a problem with multiple local maxima, the EnOPT method uses a stochastic gradient. Hence, there is a possibility of finding different results when rerunning the optimization using other random seeds or starting points. The gray line in the upper-left plot shows a trend of declined NPVs from iteration two because this experiment had a slightly different stopping criterion compared with other runs. To avoid the EnOPT algorithm getting trapped at a local optimum, we perform backtracking, i.e.,\u00a0we recompute the optimization with a smaller step size but using the same gradient, which sometimes allows us to find a drilling order with higher NPV. The stopping criteria for optimization is when the objective function fails to improve after several trial steps of backtracking. For the experiment represented by the gray line in the upper left plot of Fig.\u00a04, if the backtracking fails five times, we re-sample the ensemble of drilling priorities with reduced variance. If this procedure fails three times, the algorithm stops. This approach is a time-consuming process, even for minor problems. For other experiments, with limited computational resources, we assume the optimization converges if the backtracking trial steps fail three times.\nFor OPT2\u00a0and OPT3, we used only three backtracking steps when the algorithm stops at a local optimum. After three trial backtracking steps, we assume that the algorithm converges to a local optimum if the algorithm cannot find a better solution. For OPT2\u00a0we used three different starting points, with SPT2 giving the best result. We generated the starting sequences for the optimization randomly.\nThe boxplots in the right column show a significant improvement with a reduced spread of the NPVs from OPT1\u00a0to OPT3. In the boxplots, we evaluate the NPV of each iteration\u2019s best drilling strategy over the geological ensemble, and we illustrate the minimum and maximum values together with the first quartile, the third quartile and median represented by the lower and upper edge of the box, and the orange line inside the box, respectively.\nWe see that EnOPT benefits from a reduced geological uncertainty induced by the history-matching steps. In OPT3\u00a0the stochastic gradient becomes more stable, and the NPV estimation more accurate, leading to improved robustness of the method. We have a sound improvement from one iteration to the next for the two cases with different starting points. Still, the two starting points results in different drilling sequences, and we might improve the results further by running from additional starting points.\nFrom the results displayed in Fig.\u00a04, we notice that for OPT1, the three different starting sequences result in different solutions. Changing the initial well-priority ensembles result in other solutions even with the same starting point. We improved the drilling sequence compared to the random starting sequences, but we would assume that the best solution we found is still sub-optimal solution or near-global-optimal solution.\nIn our experiment, the first two wells drilled contribute most strongly to the total NPV. The reason is that these wells gain benefit first, and we produce them for the longest time. When we have multiple wells in the optimization sequence, we will have many local optima. From OPT1, all the solutions have a producer and injector pair for the first year. Thus, the first optimization OPT1\u00a0is about finding the best injector\u2013producer pair for year one. Depending on the starting point, the optimization locks on to a producer\u2013injector pair and then continues exploring the wells for the subsequent years. Hence, if EnOPT locks on to a sub-optimal producer\u2013injector pair for the first year, this corresponds to a local optimum. Therefore, it is important to run the optimization from different starting points to reduce the risk of converging to a local optimum.\n\n\n4.2\nHistory matching\nWe drill the two new wells having the highest priority and produce them along with the existing wells for a year after each optimization step. After a year\u2019s production, we use the produced and injected rates to history-match our ensemble of models. The additional observations obtained during the last year\u2019s production provide new information about the reservoir and lead to better reservoir characterization and lower geological uncertainty. For the history matching, we use the subspace EnRML method introduced above. Note that we initialize the history matching with the same initial ensemble and conditions to all observations available from the start of production. And for the reservoir simulations, we integrate the model ensemble from the initial time. A sequential updating of the reservoir using only the newly acquired observations is possible using the ensemble Kalman filter but introduces additional computational issues as discussed by\u00a0Skjervheim et al. (2011).\nIn Fig.\u00a05, the average cost-function values as a function of the iteration number illustrates the convergence of the subspace EnRML method. The additional observations introduced every year lead to a higher initial cost-function value. However, after a few iterations, the updated model parameters result in a cost-function value reduced to a level similar to the number of measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nCase analysis\nThe initial ensemble allows us to run ensemble simulations (ENSPRED0) with different drilling-order and well configurations, and we can assess the production uncertainty consistently with our prior-uncertainty assumptions. The optimization step OPT1\u00a0takes this assessment one step further and computes the optimal wells to drill first. The optimization (see the upper plots in Fig.\u00a04 and Table\u00a02) tells us that the producer OP-1 and the injector WI-2 have the highest drilling priorities. As they also have a positive NPV, the decision DEC1\u00a0is to drill these wells. We then produce the wells for one year (PROD1) and acquire the oil, water, and gas production rates for each well (WOPR, WGPR, and WWPR), and the injection rates (WWIR) as monthly observation data. Hence, we have 48 observations from the first year to use in the history-matching step HM1.\n\nFig.\u00a06 shows the results from HM1\u00a0for the firstly drilled producer in the upper plots (the middle and lower plots show the results after HM2\u00a0and HM3, discussed below). The plots present the prior and posterior ensembles of production profiles and the observations. After the history matching, there is a clear improvement in the ensemble prediction\u2019s match to the observed production rates. Similarly, in Fig.\u00a07, the upper left plot shows the improvement in the results for the water injector WI-2. Thus, the history-matching step has updated the reservoir porosity, permeability, and fault transmissibilities, such that OP-1 and WI-2 can produce and inject the imposed observed rates. We also expect that the updated ensemble of reservoir models will lead to a more accurate optimization and decision, with less uncertainty on the subsequent wells to drill due to the conditioning on observations by the HM.\nNext, we use the history matched ensemble from HM1\u00a0to optimize the subsequent two wells to drill. After the optimization step OPT2, the producer OP-4 and the injector WI-3 have the highest drilling priorities, and as these wells lead to a positive NPV, we decide (DEC2) to drill them next.\nIn PROD2, we produce the reservoir while including the new wells and the ones drilled initially. Hence, for the second year, we have the two producers, OP-1 and OP-4, together with the two injectors, WI-2 and WI-3. We produce the reservoir until the end of the second year while acquiring the monthly production and injection data, leading to a total of 144 observation data that we use in the following history-matching step, HM2.\nWe present the results from HM2\u00a0in the second row of Fig.\u00a06, the second row of Fig.\u00a07 and the first row of Fig.\u00a08. In Fig.\u00a06, we see that the history matching further reduces the uncertainty of the prediction for OP-1 and that we obtain an excellent match to the observations. In particular, the history matching eliminates some problematic realizations that produce too much gas in the initial ensemble. We also obtained good results for the water injectors shown in Fig.\u00a07 and the producer OP-4 presented in Fig.\u00a08.\nAgain we follow the history-matching step with another optimization step OPT3, and we decide (DEC3) to drill the producers OP-2 and OP-3 with the highest drilling priorities next, as their production also leads to a positive NPV.\nWe then produce all drilled wells until the end of the third year while acquiring the monthly observation data. We now have 312 observation data on which we condition the model. In the lower row of plots in Figs.\u00a06\u20139, we see the results from the final history-matching step HM3. For all wells, we obtain an excellent match to the data. We would, of course, expect this in a twin experiment where the ensemble statistics and model used is consistent with the reference case.\nWe do not need to optimize for drilling priorities when there are only two candidate drilling locations left for the final decision step DEC4. However, we could have included additional planned well alternatives in an optimization computation.\nThus, we have a final decision step DEC4, of determining whether to drill or not, the remaining wells OP-5 and WI-1. In the decision step DEC4, we evaluate the NPVs or different drilling scenarios. I.e., drill none of the wells (nowells), drill only OP-5 (p5), drill only WI-1 (w1), or drill both wells (p5w1). The procedure simulates the four different scenarios over the ensemble of history-matched models and evaluates the NPV of each realization for each scenario. We can then estimate the mean and uncertainty of the NPV for each scenario. We subtract the drilling costs of an assumed 60 million USD per well in the final evaluation. In a realistic setting, we should also include the operating costs of the wells.\nWe illustrate the NPV evaluation results in Fig.\u00a010. In the left plot, we observe that the scenario of not drilling any wells yields the highest mean NPV and has the least uncertainty, as shown in the right plot. Therefore, the decision of the final step is not to drill any more of the planned wells and rather continue producing the reservoir with the existing six wells. We also note that the distributions are highly overlapping, and there are many realizations that, if used alone, would give a different conclusion on whether to drill none, one, or two wells. However, the robust decision is to select the alternative with the highest mean NPV when averaged over the ensemble. Note that the ensemble histograms are close to Gaussian in the current case, which simplifies the decision process.\nFinally, we illustrate the updating of fault multipliers in Fig.\u00a011. We show the prior, posterior, and actual reference values of the six fault multipliers and, from top to bottom, the results after HM1, HM2, and HM3. The positions of the faults and wells are in Fig.\u00a03. We observe that the fault multipliers are more sensitive to the production data from wells near the faults. We denote the six faults as F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, and F7. The data are in the logarithm scale. We see that during HM1, the fault multiplier of F3 is more sensitive to the production of the open wells OP-1 and WI-2 because these two wells locate between faults F2 and F3. Similarly, we see a clear update for F3, F5, and F6 after HM2. The update results from the new observation data from the newly drilled wells OP-4 and WI-3. The well OP-4 locates between faults F4 and F5, while WI-3 is between the faults F6 and F7. Furthermore, HM3\u00a0updates the faults F5 and F7. Because we drill wells OP-2 and OP-3 before HM3. OP-2 is close to F7, and OP-3 close to F5. The observations from these two wells help update faults F5 and F7. We also note that we get close to the reference values used in the \u201ctruth\u201d model realization for all significantly updated fault multipliers. We have similar updates of the three-dimensional porosity and permeability fields, where data from different wells update different spatial regions. However, these updates are more elaborate, and we have left them out of this discussion.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThis work demonstrates a workflow of ensemble-based decision-making for closed-loop reservoir management. The decision workflow integrates well-drilling-sequence optimization and history-matching using ensemble methods that correctly account for uncertainty. Furthermore, using an ensemble of models allows for robust decision-making with decision alternatives evaluated over the ensemble of models. This decision workflow is independent of the history-matching and optimization methods used, but it requires an ensemble of model realizations to represent and predict the uncertainty. Hence, we only implement an option if it results in a positive NPV on average over the ensemble of models.\nWe have demonstrated the workflow on a simple reservoir case, REEK, provided by Equinor. We used the EnOPT method for the optimization and the subspace EnRML for history matching. While the history matching is well developed and its application well understood, we observe that the optimization methods and strategies are less mature and define an important area for further research. With significant reservoir uncertainty, it is not clear that EnOPT is the best method since the reservoir uncertainty lead to less correlation between the optimization controls and the predicted objective. The approach taken here uses multiple starting points, which helps the algorithm find a better solution and avoid getting trapped in local optima. We generated the starting sequences for the optimization randomly. An alternative strategy could be to start from the best sequence from the previous optimization step or perturbations of it if we wish to explore multiple starting points.\nAn argument against optimizing the drilling sequence over the reservoir\u2019s lifetime is that we initially have significant uncertainty in the reservoir description. The resulting optimal well sequence will likely change after the next history-matching steps, which reduce the reservoir uncertainty and improve the ensemble of models. So maybe EnOPT would work better and more easily find the optimal solution if we only optimize for one year at a time. We could even constrain the optimization to search for the optimal injector\u2013producer pair, which reduces the number of alternative solutions to 15, i.e.,\u00a0we match each of the five producers to each of the three injectors.\nAnother issue is that EnOPT is a gradient method, and here we use it to optimize a discrete sequence of wells. We have assigned a continuous variable named drilling priority to each well, and we drill the wells in the order of their drilling priority. This procedure works well, as also shown by\u00a0Hanea et al. (2017).\nThe history matching updates the model and reduces the reservoir uncertainty. Thus, after some model updates, we expect the reduced reservoir uncertainty to improve EnOPT performance. Still, we believe that we should develop and evaluate other robust optimization methods that are not based on ensemble gradients. We are currently working with some of such methods, e.g.,\u00a0Wang and Oliver (2019, 2021) but it is too early to conclude on the performance of these methods compared to using EnOPT.\nWe have had less emphasis on the decision steps and assumed Gaussian ensemble predictions, which means we should base our decision on the ensemble mean. I.e., we select the alternative that gives the highest NPV value in average over the ensemble of reservoir models. In the case of non-Gaussian predictions, we might want to use more elaborate methods based on utility theory and include risk behaviors. At this point, we emphasize that the introduction of reservoir uncertainty into decision-making helps the decision-makers make more robust decisions.\nA final exciting aspect of this work is that we now also have an efficient algorithm for \u201cwell-placement optimization\u201d. The traditional method for optimizing the placement of a well is to move it around in the reservoir until one finds the best well location. However, this is a highly nonlinear and challenging optimization problem, particularly for complex drilling trajectories and horizontal wells. Using the workflow outlined above, we can plan several additional wells based on the geologic understanding and optimize and select among these. Whenever it is uneconomical to drill any more wells, we continue producing the reservoir until the end of the reservoir life time. Every time we have updated the reservoir model with new information, we can further revise the drilling plans and targets.\nA final remark is that there may be many other fields and applications outside petroleum where the closed-loop concept is sound. We anticipate that any observed time-recursive system where one specifies the controls variables that determine the system\u2019s future evolution could benefit from a closed-loop approach involving recursive use of robust control optimization, followed by a risk-based decision process to determine the controls, and finally, the use of data assimilation or history matching of newly acquired information to update the dynamic system variables and parameters. Potential application areas in the geosciences can be geothermal energy and groundwater management (as pointed out by a reviewer). Other areas, such as managing traffic flow by controlling traffic lights and redirecting traffic to less busy roads, or managing the medicine dosage for cancer treatment or in diabetic patients, would also benefit from the ensemble-based closed-loop concept.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nYuqing Chang: Coding of methods, Running of simulations, Analysis of results, Plotting of results.
